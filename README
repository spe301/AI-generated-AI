#Problem

Gridsearches are a popular method in Machine Learning, they allow you to test out several different hyperparameter combinations to find the best model. This is a great because 
the gridsearches can increase the chances that the best possible combination is found. However, when we use Deep Learning, especially on large unstructured datasets, models take
much longer to train and even a relativley small gridsearch can take hours. What if there was a way to automatically find out the best hyperparameter combination? If we did we
could just fit one model instead of dozens, hundreds, or possibly thousands! Countless hours of compute would be saved and projects could get done faster.


#Solution

To solve this problem we can run several gridsearches, collect data; attributes of the dataset, hyparameters combinations, and model preformance, and use that as training data for
a
