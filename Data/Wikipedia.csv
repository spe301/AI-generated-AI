"aerospace is the human effort in science, engineering, and business to fly in the atmosphere of earth in most industrial countries, the aerospace industry is a cooperation of the public and private sectors. for example, several states have a civilian space program funded by the government through tax collection, such as national aeronautics and space administration in the united states, european space agency in europe, the canadian space agency in canada, indian space research organisation in india, japan aerospace exploration agency in japan, roscosmos state corporation for space activities in russia, china national space administration in china, suparco in pakistan, iranian space agency in iran, and korea aerospace research institute in south korea.along with these public space programs, many companies produce technical tools and components such as spaceships and satellites. some known companies involved in space programs include boeing, cobham, airbus, spacex, lockheed martin, united technologies, mda and northrop grumman. these companies are also involved in other areas of aerospace, such as the construction of aircraft.modern aerospace began with engineer george cayley in 1799. cayley proposed an aircraft with a ""fixed wing and a horizontal and vertical tail,"" defining characteristics of the modern airplane.the 19th century saw the creation of the aeronautical society of great britain  airmen like otto lilienthal, who introduced cambered airfoils in 1891, used gliders to analyze aerodynamic forces. the wright brothers were interested in lilienthals work and read several of his publications. they also found inspiration in octave chanute, an airman and the author of progress in flying machines  it was the preliminary work of cayley, lilienthal, chanute, and other early aerospace engineers that brought about the first powered sustained flight at kitty hawk, north carolina on december 17, 1903, by the wright brothers.war and science fiction inspired scientists and engineers like konstantin tsiolkovsky and wernher von braun to achieve flight beyond the atmosphere. world war ii inspired wernher von braun to create the v1 and v2 rockets.the launch of sputnik 1 in october 1957 started the space age, and on july 20, 1969 apollo 11 achieved the first manned moon landing. in april 1981, the space shuttle columbia launched, the start of regular manned access to orbital space. a sustained human presence in orbital space started with ""mir"" in 1986 and is continued by the ""international space station"". space commercialization and space tourism are more recent features of aerospace.aerospace manufacturing is a high-technology industry that produces ""aircraft, guided missiles, space vehicles, aircraft engines, propulsion units, and related parts"". most of the industry is geared toward governmental work.  for each original equipment manufacturer  most of those jobs were in washington state and in california, with missouri, new york and texas also being important. the leading aerospace manufacturers in the u.s. are boeing, united technologies corporation, spacex, northrop grumman and lockheed martin. these manufacturers are facing an increasing labor shortage as skilled u.s. workers age and retire. apprenticeship programs such as the aerospace joint apprenticeship council  account for a large share of the global aerospace industry and research effort, with the european space agency as one of the largest consumers of aerospace technology and products.in india, bangalore is a major center of the aerospace industry, where hindustan aeronautics limited, the national aerospace laboratories and the indian space research organisation are headquartered. the indian space research organisation  the largest transactions have been:multiple technologies and innovations are used in aerospace, many of them pioneered around world war ii:functional safety relates to a part of the general safety of a system or a piece of equipment. it implies that the system or equipment can be operated properly and without causing any danger, risk, damage or injury.functional safety is crucial in the aerospace industry, which allows no compromises or negligence. in this respect, supervisory bodies, such as the european aviation safety agency  regulate the aerospace market with strict certification standards. this is meant to reach and ensure the highest possible level of safety. the standards as 9100 in america, en 9100 on the european market or jisq 9100 in asia particularly address the aerospace and aviation industry. these are standards applying to the functional safety of aerospace vehicles. some companies are therefore specialized in the certification, inspection verification and testing of the vehicles and spare parts to ensure and attest compliance with the appropriate regulations.spinoffs refer to any technology that is a direct result of coding or products created by nasa and redesigned for an alternate purpose. these technological advancements are one of the primary results of the aerospace industry, with $5.2 billion worth of revenue generated by spinoff technology, including computers and cellular devices. these spinoffs have applications in a variety of different fields including medicine, transportation, energy, consumer goods, public safety and more. nasa publishes an annual report called ""spinoffs"", regarding many of the specific products and benefits to the aforementioned areas in an effort to highlight some of the ways funding is put to use. for example, in the most recent edition of this publication, ""spinoffs 2015"", endoscopes are featured as one of the medical derivations of aerospace achievement. this device enables more precise and subsequently cost-effective neurosurgery by reducing complications through a minimally invasive procedure that abbreviates hospitalization.",1,0
"a farmers market they are distinguished from public markets, which are generally housed in permanent structures, open year-round, and offer a variety of non-farmer/non-producer vendors, packaged foods and non-food products.the current concept of a farmers market is similar to past concepts, but different in relation to other forms 000s, consumer demand for foods that are fresher some farmers prefer the simplicity, immediacy, transparency and independence of selling direct to consumers.  one method noted by the special interest group food empowerment project promotes community-supported agriculture programs   in this scheme, consumers pay farms seasonally or monthly to receive weekly or biweekly boxes of produce.  alternatively, they may be required to pay for an entire seasons worth of produce in advance of the growing season. in either case, consumers risk losing their money if there is a crop failure.among the benefits often touted for communities with farmers markets:reduced transport, storage, and refrigeration can benefit communities too:farmers markets may also contribute to innovative distribution means that strengthen civic engagement by reducing the social distances between urban and rural communities. with fewer intermediaries, the support of independent growers by local community members can enhance local economic opportunities and health & wellness in poor communities.some consumers may favor farmers markets for the perceived:evidence seems to show that overall prices at a typical farmers market are lower than prices at a supermarket because the process of production is more concise; there is less distance to travel and fewer middlemen.due in part to the increased interest in healthier foods, a greater desire to preserve local cultivars or livestock  to 5,274 in 2009, to 8,144 in 2013. in new york city, there are 107 farmers markets in operation. in the los angeles area, 88 farmers markets exist, many of which support hispanic and asian fare.in the u.s., all levels of government have provided funding to farmers markets, for instance, through the federal programs including the supplemental nutrition assistance program, the special supplemental nutrition program for women, infants, and children, the farmers market nutrition program, and the senior farmers market nutrition program.  the programs primarily subsidize purchases at farmers markets by low-income residents. examples include austins double dollar incentive program, bostons bounty bucks, chicagos link up, columbia heights festibucks in washington, d.c., fresh checks in east palo alto, market match in los angeles, michigans double up food bucks, new york citys health bucks, portland fresh exchange, and seattle fresh bucks.  these programs often rely in part on nonprofit support.since the first farmers market was established in the uk in 1997, the number has grown to over 550 nationwide. a number of factors led to the rise of farmers markets in the uk in the late 1990s, including the increasing knowledge of consumers, the struggles of british farmers, anti-french sentiment, and concerns over food safety and quality. consumers were worried about the farming practices by which food is produced, processed and the health and safety aspects of certain foods. the emergence of books, magazine articles, and cookery and gardening programmes influence consumer concern of food preparation and consumption.the eu has formalized efforts to expand farmers markets to reduce food safety risks and poor nutrition through programs known as ""farm to fork"".farm-to-fork was developed with three main goals within the eu: the traditional public markets in chinese cities are known as ""wet markets""   yet, in other cities, wet markets persist and dominate the retail of fresh produce and meat. because of its critical role in ensuring urban food security, wet markets receive various supports from the local government.after 2010, farmers markets in china were reborn in some major cities such as beijing, shanghai, guangzhou and chengdu amidst the food safety crisis. these farmers markets a wide range of organizations initiate, organize, and manage farmers markets, including farmers groups, community groups, local governments, etc.some markets are strictly managed, with rules for pricing, quality and vendor selection. others are much more relaxed in their operations and vendor criteria. while the usual emphasis is on locally grown food products, some farmers markets allow co-ops and purveyors, or allow farmers to purchase some products to resell.there have been recent reports of fraud and products mislabeled as organic or locally grown when they are not. in some cases, fraudulent farmers markets sell regular grocery store vegetables, passing them off as organic or locally grown, to which are usually sold to unsuspecting tourists.some farmers markets have wholesale operations, sometimes limited to specific days or hours. one such wholesale farmers market is the south carolina state farmers market, which is a major supplier of watermelons, cantaloupes, and peaches for produce buyers in the north-eastern us. farmers markets also may supply buyers from produce stands, restaurants, and garden stores with fresh fruits and vegetables, plants, seedlings and nursery stock, honey, and other agricultural products. although this is on the decline, in part due to the growth of chain stores that desire national distribution networks and cheap wholesales prices017, a hidden camera investigation by the canadian broadcasting corporation found that some of the stalls in one market purchased produce on the wholesale market and and removed the original stickers, raising the cost to 50% above the retail prices.tampa bay times food critic and investigative reporter laura reiley found some vendors at local farmers markets selling rejected produce from local wholesale markets, or selling produce purchased from non-local sources. in some cases they claimed to sell products from their own farm at first, but when pressed admitted that they had grown none of the products for sale. in at least one case, despite vendor claims to the contrary, the farm in question was not growing any food, and the produce was all purchased from other companies. fraud may sometimes be obvious because the type of food being sold does not grow locally or is out of season. federal regulations in the united states require country of origin labelling for produce at supermarkets but not for small independent vendors.the tampa bay times also found that packaged foods, such as sauces, honey, jam, and beef jerky may appear to be from local vendors due to the local companys branding on the packaging, but are actually produced at co-packer plants with non-local ingredients. in the united states, the fda requires that the manufacturers name and address be listed on the food label, which can reveal this discrepancy.according to a study in the american journal of agricultural economics, farmers markets increase the number of outbreaks and cases of food-borne illness, norovirus, and campylobacter.produce for sale at a farmers market in farmington, michigan, united statescheese for sale at a farmers market in london, united kingdomfarmers market in lhasa, tibet, chinafarmers

pastries are some examples of vendor produced products sold at farmers markets. many farmers markets allow vendors to prepare and sell ready to eat foods and drinks.",1,0
"traditions by regiontraditions by schooltraditions by religionphilosophy  is the study of general and fundamental questions, such as those about reason, existence, knowledge, values, mind, and language. such questions are often posed as problems to be studied or resolved. the term was probably coined by pythagoras historically, philosophy encompassed all bodies of knowledge and a practitioner was known as a philosopher. from the time of ancient greek philosopher aristotle to the 19th century, ""natural philosophy"" encompassed astronomy, medicine, and physics. for example, newtons 1687 mathematical principles of natural philosophy later became classified as a book of physics. in the 19th century, the growth of modern research universities led academic philosophy and other disciplines to professionalize and specialize. since then, various areas of investigation that were traditionally part of philosophy have become separate academic disciplines, such as psychology, sociology, linguistics, and economics.today, major subfields of academic philosophy include metaphysics, which is concerned with the fundamental nature of existence and reality; epistemology, which studies the nature of knowledge and belief; ethics, which is concerned with moral value; and logic, which studies the rules of inference that allow one to deduce conclusions from true premises. other notable subfields include philosophy of science, political philosophy, aesthetics, philosophy of language, and philosophy of mind.initially the term referred to any body of knowledge. in this sense, philosophy is closely related to religion, mathematics, natural science, education, and politics. though it has since been classified as a book of physics, newtons mathematical principles of natural philosophy in section thirteen of his lives and opinions of the eminent philosophers, the oldest surviving history of philosophy in against the logicians the pyrrhonist philosopher sextus empiricus detailed the variety of ways in which the ancient greek philosophers had divided philosophy, noting that this three-part division was agreed to by plato, aristotle, xenocrates, and the stoics. the academic skeptic philosopher cicero also followed this three-part division.this division is not obsolete, but has changed: natural philosophy has split into the various natural sciences, especially physics, astronomy, chemistry, biology, and cosmology; moral philosophy has birthed the social sciences, while still including value theory  chalmers, by contrast, sees progress in philosophy similar to that in science, while brewer argues that ""progress"" is the wrong standard by which to judge philosophical activity.in one general sense, philosophy is associated with wisdom, intellectual culture, and a search for knowledge. in this sense, all cultures and literate societies ask philosophical questions, such as ""how are we to live"" and ""what is the nature of reality."" a broad and impartial conception of philosophy, then, finds a reasoned inquiry into such matters as reality, morality, and life in all world civilizations.western philosophy is the philosophical tradition of the western world, dating back to pre-socratic thinkers who were active in 6th-century greece  and were also termed students of nature  who founded the peripatetic school. other ancient philosophical traditions influenced by socrates included cynicism, cyrenaicism, stoicism, and academic skepticism. two other traditions were influenced by socrates contemporary, democritus: pyrrhonism and epicureanism. important topics covered by the greeks included metaphysics  following the rise of natural science, modern philosophy was concerned with developing a secular and rational foundation for knowledge and moved away from traditional structures of authority such as religion, scholastic thought and the church. major modern philosophers include spinoza, leibniz, locke, berkeley, hume, and kant.19th-century philosophy early islamic philosophy developed the greek philosophical traditions in new innovative directions. this intellectual work inagurated what is known as the islamic golden age. the two main currents of early islamic thought are kalam, which focuses on islamic theology, and falsafa, which was based on aristotelianism and neoplatonism. the work of aristotle was very influential among philosophers such as al-kindi  several schools of islamic philosophy continued to flourish after the golden age however, and include currents such as illuminationist philosophy, sufi philosophy, and transcendent theosophy. the 19th- and 20th-century arab world saw the nahda movement  refers to the diverse philosophical traditions that emerged since the ancient times on the indian subcontinent. indian philosophical traditions share various key concepts and ideas, which are defined in different ways and accepted or rejected by the different traditions. these include concepts such as dh0th century. for example, new confucianism, led by figures such as xiong shili, has become quite influential. likewise, humanistic buddhism is a recent modernist buddhist movement.modern japanese thought meanwhile developed under strong western influences such as the study of western sciences during the 17th century, ethiopian philosophy developed a robust literary tradition as exemplified by zera yacob. another early african philosopher was anton wilhelm amo  the practices to access these transcendental experiences are termed shamanism. another feature of the indigenous american worldviews was their extension of ethics to non-human animals and plants.in mesoamerica, aztec philosophy was an intellectual tradition developed by individuals called tlamatini  and its ideas are preserved in various aztec codices. the aztec worldview posited the concept of an ultimate universal energy or force called 016. some philosophers argue that this professionalization has negatively affected the discipline.",1,0

"water skiing  and a personal flotation device. in addition, the skier must have adequate upper and lower body strength, muscular endurance, and good balance.there are water ski participants around the world, in asia and australia, europe, africa, and the americas. in the united states alone, there are approximately 11 million water skiers and over 900 sanctioned water ski competitions every year. australia boasts 1.3 million water skiers.there are many options for recreational or competitive water skiers. these include speed skiing, trick skiing, show skiing, slaloming, jumping, barefoot skiing and wakeski. similar, related sports are wakeboarding, kneeboarding, discing, tubing, and sit-down hydrofoil.water skiers can start their ski set in one of two ways: wet is the most common, but dry is possible. water skiing typically begins with a deep-water start. the skier enters the water with their skis on or they jump in without the skis on their feet, have the skis floated to them, and put them on while in the water. most times it can be easier to put the skis on when they are wet. once the skier has their skis on they will be thrown a tow rope from the boat, which they position between their skis. in the deep-water start, the skier crouches down in the water while holding onto the ski rope; they are in a cannonball position with their legs tucked into their chest, with skis pointing towards the sky and approximately 30163 metres   although length varies widely depending on the type of water skiing and the skiers skill level. competition requirements on rope construction have changed over the years, from ""quarter-inch polypropylene rope"" in 1992 to the 2003 flexibility as long as the same specification is used ""for the entire event."" the rope and handle are anchored to the boat and played out at the stern. this anchor point on a recreation boat is commonly a tow ring or cleat, mounted on the boats stern. for more dedicated skiers, a metal ski pylon is placed in the center of the boat in front of the engine to connect the skier. this pylon must be mounted securely, since a skilled slalom skier can put a considerable amount of tension on the ski rope and the pylon.as water skiing is a potentially dangerous sport, safety is important.there should be a 200 feet  without proper space and visibility skiing can be extremely dangerous,  but skiers should wear a life jacket regardless of swimming ability. specially-designed life jackets or ski vests allow movement needed for the sport while still providing floation for a downed or injured skier.  the most common water ski injuries involve the lower legs, such as the knee, because a fall at high speed can create irregular angles of collision between the skiers body and the water surface. another common cause of injury is colliding with objects on or near the water, like docks.the tow boat must contain at least two people: a driver and an observer. in most locales, the observer will need to be at least 12 years of age. the driver maintains a steady course, free of obstacles to the skier. the observer continually observes the skier, relays the condition of the skier to the boat driver, and if necessary, raises the ""skier down"" warning flag, as required, when a skier is in the water, returning to the boat, or in some localities, the entire time the skier is out of the boat. the skier and observer should agree on a set of standard hand-signals for easy communication: stop, speed up, turn, im ok, skier in the water, etc.water skiing was invented in 1922 when ralph samuelson used a pair of boards as skis and a clothesline as a towrope on lake pepin in lake city, minnesota. samuelson experimented with different positions on the skis for several days until 2 july 1922. samuelson discovered that leaning backwards in the water with ski tips up and poking out of the water at the tip was the optimal method. his brother ben towed him and they reached a speed of 32 kilometres per hour  samuelson spent 15 years performing shows and teaching water skiing to people in the united states.samuelson went through several iterations of equipment in his quest to ski on water. his first equipment consisted of barrel staves for skis. he later tried snow skis, but finally fabricated his own design out of lumber with bindings made of strips of leather. the ski rope was made from a long window sash cord. samuelson never patented any of his ski equipment.the first patent for water skis was issued to fred waller, of huntington, ny, on 27 october 1925, for skis he developed independently and marketed as ""dolphin akwa-skees."" wallers skis were constructed of kiln-dried mahogany, as were some boats at that time. jack andresen patented the first trick ski, a shorter, fin-less water ski, in 1940.in 1928, don ibsen developed his own water skis out in bellevue, washington, never having heard of samuelson or waller. in 1941, don ibsen founded the olympic water ski club in seattle, washington. it was the first such club in america. ibsen, a showman and entrepreneur, was one of the earliest manufacturers of water skis and was a leading enthusiast and promoter of the sport. in 1983, he was inducted into the water ski hall of fame in winter haven, florida.the sport of water skiing remained an obscure activity for several years after 1922, until samuelson performed water ski shows from michigan to florida. the american water ski association formally acknowledged samuelson in 1966 as the first recorded water skier in history. samuelson was also the first ski racer, slalom skier, and the first organizer of a water ski show.parallel to this, an avid sailor, sportsman and early adopter of water skiing, the young swedish engineer gunnar ljungstr8, for a distance of 25 feet. his son, dick pope, jr., is the inventor of bare-foot skiing. both men are in the water ski hall of fame. today, winter haven, florida, with its famous chain of lakes, remains an important city for water skiing, with several major ski schools operating there.water skiing has developed over time. water skiing tournaments and water skiing competitions have been organized. as an exhibition sport, water skiing was included in the 1972 olympics. the first national show ski tournament was held in 1974, and the first ever national intercollegiate water ski championships were held in 1979. the home care us national water ski challenge, the first competition for people with disabilities, was organized ten years later.the first patented design of a water ski which included carbon fiber was that of hani audah at sport labs in 2001. its first inclusion in tournament slalom skiing was in 2003.in the united states, there are over 900 sanctioned water ski competitions each summer. orlando, florida is considered to be the competitive 3-event waterskiing capital of the world. competitive water skiing consists of three events: slalom, jump, and trick.in an attempt to become as agile as possible, slalom water skiers use only one ski with feet oriented forward, one in front of the other. slalom skis are narrow and long, at 57 kilometres per hour trick skiing uses small, oval-shaped or oblong water skis. beginners generally use two skis while more advanced skiers use one. the shorter, wider trick ski has a front binding facing forward and a back binding facing at a 45013 tournament rules for 3-event competition in the united states and the pan-am games, skis used in the tricks event must be a single ski without fins, although molded rails/grooves less than 6.40-second runs during which they perform a series of their chosen tricks. in most cases, one pass is for hand tricks, which includes surface turns, rotations over the wake, and flips. the second pass is for toe tricks, which are done by doing wake turns and rotations with only a foot attaching them to the handle; the foot is either in the toehold part of the handle or, professionally, attached to the rope. the toehold part of the handle does not allow the skier to let go of the handle if they lose their balance and fall into the water, therefore a person in the boat is required to release the rope from the boat using a quick release mechanism installed on the ski pylon. a trick cannot be repeated. each trick has a point value. a panel of five judges assesses which tricks were completed correctly and assigns that predetermined point value to each successfully completed trick. the skier with the most points wins.a barefoot water skier should use a wetsuit instead of a life jacket because the wetsuit covers more of the body in case of a fall at high speed. the wetsuit also allows the skier to do starts in the water where they lie on their back. unlike a normal life jacket, the ""barefoot wetsuit"" allows the skier to glide on their back on top of the water once they reach a high enough speed. the barefoot wetsuit is generally thicker in the back, rear, and chest for flotation and impact absorption.barefoot skiing requires a higher speed because the skiers feet are smaller than skis, providing less lift. a rule of thumb for barefoot water skiing speed in miles per hour is   the bi-annual world show ski championship was inaugurated in september 2012 in janesville, wisconsin. past competition included teams from australia, belgium, canada, china, and the united states.freestyle jumping is often related to show skiing. the goal is to go off the jump, perform one of many stunts, and successfully land back on the water. the most common freestyle stunts  skiers per boat who race around a set course behind boats set up for this type of event. it can occur in a circle or lap format type racing or on river courses offering longer distances and higher speeds. races can be timed events such as 20 minute races and up to 1 hour or on courses where race distance can be over 100001 feet in length. outboards are commonly 300hp and inboards around 1,300hp (majority are turbocharged.current format world championship racing involves mens and womens open (unrestricted, and mens and women formula 2 (limited to single rig, 300 years with the most recent being 2019 in vichy, france.major events include the southern 80 (echuca victoria australia, the diamond race (viersel belgium, the catalina ski race (long beach ca usa, and the sydney bridge to bridge (sydney australia. races can have anywhere from 10 boats to 150 boats competing (grouped by engine size and age classes.disabled water skiing uses equipment or other adaptations to allow disabled people to compete in standard 3 event skiing.  seated water skis, special handles, audio slalom gear, and other adaptations are all used for different disabilities.",1,0

"vanilla is a spice derived from orchids of the genus vanilla, primarily obtained from pods of the mexican species, flat-leaved vanilla  aztecs invading from the central highlands of mexico conquered the totonacs, and developed a taste for the vanilla pods. they named the fruit tlilxochitl, or ""black flower"", after the matured fruit, which shrivels and turns black shortly after being picked. spanish conquistador hern0s.until the mid-19th century, mexico was the chief producer of vanilla. in 1819, french entrepreneurs shipped vanilla fruits to the islands of r00 metric tons of vanilla beans, about 80% of world production in that year. according to the united nations food and agriculture organization 2019 data, madagascar, followed by indonesia, were the largest producers of vanilla in 2018.after a tropical cyclone ravaged key croplands, the market price of vanilla rose sharply in the late 1970s and remained high through the early 1980s despite the introduction of indonesian vanilla. in the mid-1980s, the cartel that had controlled vanilla prices and distribution since its creation in 1930 disbanded. prices dropped 70% over the next few years, to nearly us$20 per kilogram; prices rose sharply again after tropical cyclone hudah struck madagascar in april 2000. the cyclone, political instability, and poor weather in the third year drove vanilla prices to us$500/kg in 2004, bringing new countries into the vanilla industry. a good crop, coupled with decreased demand caused by the production of imitation vanilla, pushed the market price down to the $40/kg range in the middle of 2005. by 2010, prices were down to $20/kg.  cyclone enawo caused in similar spike to $500/kg in 2017.an estimated 95% of ""vanilla"" products are artificially flavored with vanillin derived from lignin instead of vanilla fruits.vanilla was completely unknown in the old world before cort-year-old slave named edmond albius on r0 to 30 g of p2o5 and 60 to 100 g of k2o should be applied to each plant per year besides organic manures, such as vermicompost, oil cakes, poultry manure, and wood ash. foliar applications are also good for vanilla, and a solution of 1% npk  cuttings between 60 and 120 hours of opening. in the wild, very few natural pollinators exist, with most pollination thought to be carried out by the shiny green euglossa viridissima, some eulaema spp. and other species of the euglossine or orchid bees, euglossini, though direct evidence is lacking. closely related vanilla species are known to be pollinated by the euglossine bees. the previously suggested pollination by stingless bees of the genus melipona is thought to be improbable, as they are too small to be effective and have never been observed carrying vanilla pollen or pollinating other orchids, though they do visit the flowers. these pollinators do not exist outside the orchids home range, and even within that range, vanilla orchids have only a 1% chance of successful pollination. as a result, all vanilla grown today is pollinated by hand. a small splinter of wood or a grass stem is used to lift the rostellum or move the flap upward, so the overhanging anther can be pressed against the stigma and self-pollinate the vine. generally, one flower per raceme opens per day, so the raceme may be in flower for over 20 days. a healthy vine should produce about 50 to 100 beans per year, but growers are careful to pollinate only five or six flowers from the 20 on each raceme. the first flowers that open per vine should be pollinated, so the beans are similar in age. these agronomic practices facilitate harvest and increases bean quality. the fruits require five to six weeks to develop, but around six months to mature. over-pollination  results in diseases and inferior bean quality. a vine remains productive between 12 and 14 years.vanilla is susceptible to many fungal and viral diseases. fusarium, sclerotium, phytophthora, and colletrotrichum species cause rots of root, stem, leaf, bean, and shoot apex. development of most diseases is favoured by unsuitable growing conditions such as overwatering, insufficient drainage, heavy mulch, overpollination, and too much shade. fungal diseases can be controlled by spraying bordeaux mixture  if organic agriculture is practiced, insecticides are avoided, and mechanical measures are adopted for pest management. most of these practices are implemented under greenhouse cultivation, since such field conditions are very difficult to achieve.most artificial vanilla products contain vanillin, which can be produced synthetically from lignin, a natural polymer found in wood. most synthetic vanillin is a byproduct from the pulp used in papermaking, in which the lignin is broken down using sulfites or sulfates. however, vanillin is only one of 171 identified aromatic components of real vanilla fruits.the orchid species leptotes bicolor is used as a natural vanilla replacement in paraguay and southern brazil.in 1996 the us food and drug administration cautioned that some  vanilla products sold in mexico were made from the cheaper tonka bean which as well as vanillin also contains the toxin coumarin. they advised consumers to always check the ingredients label and avoid suspiciously cheap products.in the united states, castoreum, the exudate from the castor sacs of mature beavers, has been approved by the food and drug administration  as a food additive, often referenced simply as a ""natural flavoring"" in the products list of ingredients. it is used in both food and beverages, especially as vanilla and raspberry flavoring, with a total annual u.s. production of less than 300 pounds. it is also used to flavor some cigarettes and in perfume-making, and is used by fur trappers as a scent lure.harvesting vanilla fruits is as labor-intensive as pollinating the blossoms. immature, dark green pods are not harvested. pale yellow discoloration that commences at the distal end of the fruits is not a good indication of the maturity of pods. each fruit ripens at its own time, requiring a daily harvest. ""current methods for determining the maturity of vanilla  the accumulation of dry matter and glucovanillin are highly correlated.to ensure the finest flavor from every fruit, each individual pod must be picked by hand just as it begins to split on the end. overmatured fruits are likely to split, causing a reduction in market value. its commercial value is fixed based on the length and appearance of the pod.if the fruit is more than 155.5% vanillin.once fully cured, the vanilla fruits are sorted by quality and graded. several vanilla fruit grading systems are in use. each country which produces vanilla has its own grading system, and individual vendors, in turn, sometimes use their own criteria for describing the quality of the fruits they offer for sale. in general, vanilla fruit grade is based on the length, appearance  whole, dark, plump and oily pods that are visually attractive, with no blemishes, and that have a higher moisture content are graded most highly. such pods are particularly prized by chefs for their appearance and can be featured in gourmet dishes. beans that show localized signs of disease or other physical defects are cut to remove the blemishes; the shorter fragments left are called ""cuts"" and are assigned lower grades, as are fruits with lower moisture contents. lower-grade fruits tend to be favored for uses in which the appearance is not as important, such as in the production of vanilla flavoring extract and in the fragrance industry.higher-grade fruits command higher prices in the market. however, because grade is so dependent on visual appearance and moisture content, fruits with the highest grade do not necessarily contain the highest concentration of characteristic flavor molecules such as vanillin, and are not necessarily the most flavorful.018, world production of vanilla was 7,575 tonnes, led by madagascar with 41.0% of the total, and indonesia with 29.8%  the intensity of criminal enterprises against madagascar farmers is high, elevating the worldwide cost of using madagascar vanilla in consumer products.the four main commercial preparations of natural vanilla are:vanilla flavoring in food may be achieved by adding vanilla extract or by cooking vanilla pods in the liquid preparation. a stronger aroma may be attained if the pods are split in two, exposing more of a pods surface area to the liquid. in this case, the pods seeds are mixed into the preparation. natural vanilla gives a brown or yellow color to preparations, depending on the concentration. good-quality vanilla has a strong, aromatic flavor, but food with small amounts of low-quality vanilla or artificial vanilla-like flavorings are far more common, since true vanilla is much more expensive.regarded as the worlds most popular aroma and flavor,  vanilla is a widely used aroma and flavor compound for foods, beverages and cosmetics, as indicated by its popularity as an ice cream flavor. although vanilla is a prized flavoring agent on its own, it is also used to enhance the flavor of other substances, to which its own flavor is often complementary, such as chocolate, custard, caramel, coffee, and others. vanilla is a common ingredient in western sweet baked goods, such as cookies and cakes. despite the expense, vanilla is highly valued for its flavor.the food industry uses methyl and ethyl vanillin as less-expensive substitutes for real vanilla. ethyl vanillin is more expensive, but has a stronger note. cooks illustrated ran several taste tests pitting vanilla against vanillin in baked goods and other applications, and to the consternation of the magazine editors, tasters could not differentiate the flavor of vanillin from vanilla; however, for the case of vanilla ice cream, natural vanilla won out.  a more recent and thorough test by the same group produced a more interesting variety of results; namely, high-quality artificial vanilla flavoring is best for cookies, while high-quality real vanilla is slightly better for cakes and significantly better for unheated or lightly heated foods. the liquid extracted from vanilla pods was once believed to have medical properties, helping with various stomach ailments.the sap of most species of vanilla orchid which exudes from cut stems or where beans are harvested can cause moderate to severe dermatitis if it comes in contact with bare skin. the sap of vanilla orchids contains calcium oxalate crystals, which are thought to be the main causative agent of contact dermatitis in vanilla plantation workers.a vanilla planting in an open field on r\xc3\xa9uniona vanilla planting in a ""shader"" (ombri\xc3\xa8re on r\xc3\xa9unionflowergreen fruits",1,0
"salt is a mineral composed primarily of sodium chloride  excessive salt consumption may increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases, such as hypertension, in children and adults. such health effects of salt have long been studied. accordingly, numerous world health associations and experts in developed countries recommend reducing consumption of popular salty foods. the world health organization recommends that adults should consume less than 2,000800 bc, the egyptians began exporting salt fish to the phoenicians in return for lebanon cedar, glass, and the dye tyrian purple; the phoenicians traded egyptian salted fish and salt from north africa throughout their mediterranean trade empire. herodotus described salt trading routes across libya back in the 5th century bc. in the early years of the roman empire, roads were built for the transportation of salt from the salt imported at ostia to the capital.in africa, salt was used as currency south of the sahara, and slabs of rock salt were used as coins in abyssinia. moorish merchants in the 6th century traded salt for gold, weight for weight. the tuareg have traditionally maintained routes across the sahara especially for the transportation of salt by azalai   in gabon, before the arrival of europeans, the coast people carried on a remunerative trade with those of the interior by the medium of sea salt.  this was gradually displaced by the salt that europeans brought in sacks, so that the coast natives lost their previous profits; as of the authors writing in 1958, sea salt was still the currency best appreciated in the interior.salzburg, hallstatt, and hallein lie within 17h2o. solutions of sodium chloride have very different properties from those of pure water; the freezing point is 21.124 and consists of table salt mixed with a minute amount of potassium iodide, sodium iodide or sodium iodate. a small amount of dextrose may also be added to stabilize the iodine. iodine deficiency affects about two billion people around the world and is the leading preventable cause of mental retardation. iodized table salt has significantly reduced disorders of iodine deficiency in countries where it is used.the amount of iodine and the specific iodine compound added to salt varies from country to country. in the united states, the food and drug administration  150 micrograms of iodine per day for both men and women. us iodized salt contains 46,000,30000,300% is used in water conditioning processes, 8% goes for de-icing highways and 6% is used in agriculture. the rest  and sodium chloride is one of the largest inorganic raw materials used by volume. its major chemical products are caustic soda and chlorine, which are separated by the electrolysis of a pure brine solution. these are used in the manufacture of pvc, plastics, paper pulp and many other inorganic and organic compounds. salt is also used as a flux in the production of aluminium. for this purpose, a layer of melted salt floats on top of the molten metal and removes iron and other metal contaminants. it is also used in the manufacture of soaps and glycerine, where it is added to the vat to precipitate out the saponified products. as an emulsifier, salt is used in the manufacture of synthetic rubber, and another use is in the firing of pottery, when salt added to the furnace vaporises before condensing onto the surface of the ceramic material, forming a strong glaze.when drilling through loose materials such as sand or gravel, salt may be added to the drilling fluid to provide a stable ""wall"" to prevent the hole collapsing. there are many other processes in which salt is involved. these include its use as a mordant in textile dying, to regenerate resins in water softening, for the tanning of hides, the preservation of meat and fish and the canning of meat and vegetables.food-grade salt accounts for only a small part of salt production in industrialized countries  although worldwide, food uses account for 17.5% of total production.in 2018, total world production of salt was 300 million tonnes, the top six producers being china the manufacture of salt is one of the oldest chemical industries. a major source of salt is seawater, which has a salinity of approximately 3.5%. this means that there are about 35 grams  the worlds oceans are a virtually inexhaustible source of salt, and this abundance of supply means that reserves have not been calculated. the evaporation of seawater is the production method of choice in marine countries with high evaporation and low precipitation rates. salt evaporation ponds are filled from the ocean and salt crystals can be harvested as the water dries up. sometimes these ponds have vivid colours, as some species of algae and other micro-organisms thrive in conditions of high salinity.elsewhere, salt is extracted from the vast sedimentary deposits which have been laid down over the millennia from the evaporation of seas and lakes. these are either mined directly, producing rock salt, or are extracted in solution by pumping water into the deposit. in either case, the salt may be purified by mechanical evaporation of brine. traditionally, this was done in shallow open pans which were heated to increase the rate of evaporation. more recently, the process is performed in pans under vacuum. the raw salt is refined to purify it and improve its storage and handling characteristics. this usually involves recrystallization during which a brine solution is treated with chemicals that precipitate most impurities  some salt is produced using the alberger process, which involves vacuum pan evaporation combined with the seeding of the solution with cubic crystals, and produces a grainy-type flake. the ayoreo, an indigenous group from the paraguayan chaco, obtain their salt from the ash produced by burning the timber of the indian salt tree one of the largest salt mining operations in the world is at the khewra salt mine in pakistan. the mine has nineteen storeys, eleven of which are underground, and 400\xa0km salt has long held an important place in religion and culture. at the time of brahmanic sacrifices, in hittite rituals and during festivals held by semites and greeks at the time of the new moon, salt was thrown into a fire where it produced crackling noises. the ancient egyptians, greeks and romans invoked their gods with offerings of salt and water and some people think this to be the origin of holy water in the christian faith. in aztec mythology, huixtocihuatl was a fertility goddess who presided over salt and salt water.salt is considered to be a very auspicious substance in hinduism and is used in particular religious ceremonies like house-warmings and weddings. in jainism, devotees lay an offering of raw rice with a pinch of salt before a deity to signify their devotion and salt is sprinkled on a persons cremated remains before the ashes are buried. salt is believed to ward off evil spirits in mahayana buddhist tradition, and when returning home from a funeral, a pinch of salt is thrown over the left shoulder as this prevents evil spirits from entering the house. in shinto, shio in the hebrew bible, there are thirty-five verses which mention salt. one of these mentions lots wife, who was turned into a pillar of salt when she looked back at the cities of sodom and gomorrah  in the new testament, six verses mention salt. in the sermon on the mount, jesus referred to his followers as the ""salt of the earth"". the apostle paul also encouraged christians to ""let your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt""  salt is mandatory in the rite of the tridentine mass. salt is used in the third item in judaism, it is recommended to have either a salty bread or to add salt to the bread if this bread is unsalted when doing kiddush for shabbat. it is customary to spread some salt over the bread or to dip the bread in a little salt when passing the bread around the table after the kiddush. to preserve the covenant between their people and god, jews dip the sabbath bread in salt.in wicca, salt is symbolic of the element earth. it is also believed to cleanse an area of harmful or negative energies. a dish of salt and a dish of water are almost always present on an altar, and salt is used in a wide variety of rituals and ceremonies.",1,0
"political science, occasionally called politology, is a discipline of social science which deals with systems of governance, and the analysis of political activities, political thoughts, associated constitutions and political behavior.political science comprises numerous subfields, including comparative politics, political economy, international relations, political theory, public administration, public policy, and political methodology.  furthermore, political science is related to, and draws upon, the fields of economics, law, sociology, history, philosophy, human geography, journalism, political anthropology, and social policy.comparative politics is the science of comparison and teaching of different types of constitutions, political actors, legislature and associated fields, all of them from an intrastate perspective. international relations deals with the interaction between nation-states as well as intergovernmental and transnational organizations. political theory is more concerned with contributions of various classical and contemporary thinkers and philosophers.political science is methodologically diverse and appropriates many methods originating in psychology, social research and cognitive neuroscience. approaches include positivism, interpretivism, rational choice theory, behaviouralism, structuralism, post-structuralism, realism, institutionalism, and pluralism. political science, as one of the social sciences, uses methods and techniques that relate to the kinds of inquiries sought: primary sources, such as historical documents and official records, secondary sources such as scholarly journal articles, survey research, statistical analysis, case studies, experimental research, and model building.as a social political science, contemporary political science started to take shape in the latter half of the 19th century. at that time it began to separate itself from political philosophy, which traces its roots back to the works of aristotle and plato, which were written nearly 2,500 years ago. the term ""political science"" was not always distinguished from political philosophy, and the modern discipline has a clear set of antecedents including also moral philosophy, political economy, political theology, history, and other fields concerned with normative determinations of what ought to be and with deducing the characteristics and functions of the ideal state.the advent of political science as a university discipline was marked by the creation of university departments and chairs with the title of political science arising in the late 19th century. in fact, the designation ""political scientist"" is typically for those with a doctorate in the field, but can also apply to those with a masters in the subject. integrating political studies of the past into a unified discipline is ongoing, and the history of political science has provided a rich field for the growth of both normative and positive political science, with each part of the discipline sharing some historical predecessors. the american political science association and the american political science review were founded in 1903 and 1906, respectively, in an effort to distinguish the study of politics from economics and other social phenomena.in the 1950s and the 1960s, a behavioural revolution stressing the systematic and rigorously scientific study of individual and group behaviour swept the discipline. a focus on studying political behaviour, rather than institutions or interpretation of legal texts, characterized early behavioural political science, including work by robert dahl, philip converse, and in the collaboration between sociologist paul lazarsfeld and public opinion scholar bernard berelson.the late 1960s and early 1970s witnessed a take off in the use of deductive, game theoretic formal modelling techniques aimed at generating a more analytical corpus of knowledge in the discipline. this period saw a surge of research that borrowed theory and methods from economics to study political institutions, such as the united states congress, as well as political behaviour, such as voting. william h. riker and his colleagues and students at the university of rochester were the main proponents of this shift.despite considerable research progress in the discipline based on all the kinds of scholarship discussed above, it has been observed that progress toward systematic theory has been modest and uneven.in 2000, the perestroika movement in political science was introduced as a reaction against what supporters of the movement called the mathematicization of political science. those who identified with the movement argued for a plurality of methodologies and approaches in political science and for more relevance of the discipline to those outside of it.some evolutionary psychology theories argue that humans have evolved a highly developed set of psychological mechanisms for dealing with politics. however, these mechanisms evolved for dealing with the small group politics that characterized the ancestral environment and not the much larger political structures in todays world. this is argued to explain many important features and systematic cognitive biases of current politics.political science is a social study concerning the allocation and transfer of power in decision making, the roles and systems of governance including governments and international organizations, political behaviour and public policies. they measure the success of governance and specific policies by examining many factors, including stability, justice, material wealth, peace and public health. some political scientists seek to advance positive political scientists may provide the frameworks from which journalists, special interest groups, politicians, and the electorate analyse issues. according to chaturvedy,political scientists may serve as advisers to specific politicians, or even run for office as politicians themselves. political scientists can be found working in governments, in political parties or as civil servants. they may be involved with non-governmental organizations political scientists may study political phenomena within one specific country; for example, they may study just the politics of the united states, or just the politics of china.in the case of the united states, political scientists known as ""americanists"" look at a variety of data including constitutional development, elections, public opinion, and public policy such as social security reform, foreign policy, us congressional committees, and the us supreme court. political scientists will often focus on the politics of their own country, so for example a political scientist from indonesia may become an expert in the politics of indonesia.the theory of political transitions, and the methods of their analysis and anticipating of crises, form an important part of political science. several general indicators of crises and methods were proposed for anticipating critical transitions. among them, a statistical indicator of crisis, simultaneous increase of variance and correlations in large groups, was proposed for crisis anticipation and may be successfully used in various areas. its applicability for early diagnosis of political crises was demonstrated by the analysis of the prolonged stress period preceding the 2014 ukrainian economic and political crisis. there was a simultaneous increase in the total correlation between the 19 major public fears in the ukrainian society  a feature shared by certain major revolutions is that they were not predicted.  the theory of apparent inevitability of crises and revolutions was also developed.the study of major crises, both political crises and external crises that can affect politics, is not limited to attempts to predict regime transitions or major changes in political institutions. political scientists also study how governments handle unexpected disasters, and how voters in democracies react to their governments preparations for and responses to crises.most political scientists work broadly in one or more of the following five areas:program evaluation is a systematic method for collecting, analyzing, and using information to answer questions about projects, policies and programs, particularly about their effectiveness and efficiency. in both the public and private sectors, stakeholders often want to know whether the programs they are funding, implementing, voting for, receiving or objecting to are producing the intended effect. while program evaluation first focuses around this definition, important considerations often include how much the program costs per participant, how the program could be improved, whether the program is worthwhile, whether there are better alternatives, if there are unintended outcomes, and whether the program goals are appropriate and useful.policy analysis is a technique used in public administration to enable civil servants, activists, and others to examine and evaluate the available options to implement the goals of laws and elected officials.some political science departments also classify methodology as well as scholarship on the domestic politics of a particular country as distinct fields. in the united states, american politics is often treated as a separate subfield.in contrast to this traditional classification, some academic departments organize scholarship into thematic categories, including political philosophy, political behaviour political science is methodologically diverse; political scientists approach the study of politics from a host of different ontological orientations and with a variety of different tools. because political science is essentially a study of human behaviour, in all aspects of politics, observations in controlled environments are often challenging to reproduce or duplicate, though experimental methods are increasingly common  citing this difficulty, former american political science association president lawrence lowell once said ""we are limited by the impossibility of experiment. politics is an observational, not an experimental science."" because of this, political scientists have historically observed political elites, institutions, and individual or group behaviour in order to identify patterns, draw generalizations, and build theories of politics.like all social sciences, political science faces the difficulty of observing human actors that can only be partially observed and who have the capacity for making conscious choices unlike other subjects such as non-human organisms in biology or inanimate objects as in physics. despite the complexities, contemporary political science has progressed by adopting a variety of methods and theoretical approaches to understanding politics, and methodological pluralism is a defining feature of contemporary political science.empirical political science methods include the use of field experiments, surveys and survey experiments, case studies, process tracing, historical and institutional analysis, ethnography, participant observation, and interview research.political scientists also use and develop theoretical tools like game theory and agent based models to study a host of political systems and situations.political theorists approach theories of political phenomenon with a similar diversity of positions and tools, including feminist political theory, historical analysis associated with the cambridge school, straussian approaches, and others. political science may overlap with topics of study that are the traditional focuses of other social sciences, for example when sociological norms or psychological biases are connected to political phenomena. in these cases, political science may either inherit their methods of study or it may develop a contrasting approach. for example, lisa wedeen has argued that political sciences approach to the idea of culture, originating with gabriel almond and sidney verba and exemplified by authors like samuel p. huntington, could benefit from aligning more closely with the study of culture in anthropology. in turn, methodologies that are developed within political science may influence the way that researchers in other fields, like public health, conceive of and approach political processes and policies.political science, possibly like the social sciences as a whole, ""as a discipline lives on the fault line between the two cultures in the academy, the sciences and the humanities."" thus, in some american colleges where there is no separate school or college of arts and sciences per se, political science may be a separate department housed as part of a division or school of humanities or liberal arts. whereas classical political philosophy is primarily defined by a concern for hellenic and enlightenment thought, political scientists are also marked by a great concern for ""modernity"" and the contemporary nation state, along with the study of classical thought, and as such share a greater deal of terminology with sociologists  separate degree granting programs in international relations and public policy are not uncommon at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. masters level programs in political science are common when political scientists engage in public administration.the national honour society for college and university students of government and politics in the united states is pi sigma alpha.",1,0
"socialism is a political, social and economic philosophy encompassing a range of economic and social systems characterised by social ownership of the means of production and workers self-management of enterprises. it includes the political theories and movements associated with such systems. social ownership can be public, collective, cooperative, or of equity. while no single definition encapsulates many types of socialism, social ownership is the one common element. socialists disagree about the degree to which social control or regulation of the economy is necessary; how far society should intervene and whether government, particularly existing government, is the correct vehicle for change.socialist systems are divided into non-market and market forms. non-market socialism substitutes factor markets and money with integrated economic planning and engineering or technical criteria based on calculation performed in-kind, thereby producing a different economic mechanism that functions according to different economic laws and dynamics than those of capitalism. a non-market socialist system eliminates the inefficiencies and crises traditionally associated with capital accumulation and the profit system in capitalism. the socialist calculation debate, originated by the economic calculation problem, concerns the feasibility and methods of resource allocation for a planned socialist system. by contrast, market socialism retains the use of monetary prices, factor markets and in some cases the profit motive, with respect to the operation of socially owned enterprises and the allocation of capital goods between them. profits generated by these firms would be controlled directly by the workforce of each firm or accrue to society at large in the form of a social dividend. anarchism and libertarian socialism oppose the use of the state as a means to establish socialism, favouring decentralisation above all, whether to establish non-market socialism or market socialism.socialist politics has been both internationalist and nationalist in orientation; organised through political parties and opposed to party politics; at times overlapping with trade unions and at other times independent and critical of them; and present in both industrialised and developing nations. social democracy originated within the socialist movement, supporting economic and social interventions to promote social justice. while retaining socialism as a long-term goal, since the post-war period it has come to embrace a keynesian mixed economy within a predominantly developed capitalist market economy and liberal democratic polity that expands state intervention to include income redistribution, regulation and a welfare state. economic democracy proposes a sort of market socialism, with more democratic control of companies, currencies, investments and natural resources.the socialist political movement includes a set of political philosophies that originated in the revolutionary movements of the mid-to-late 18th century and out of concern for the social problems that were associated with capitalism. by the late 19th century, after the work of karl marx and his collaborator friedrich engels, socialism had come to signify opposition to capitalism and advocacy for a post-capitalist system based on some form of social ownership of the means of production. by the 1920s, communism and social democracy had become the two dominant political tendencies within the international socialist movement, with socialism itself becoming the most influential secular movement of the 20th century. socialist parties and ideas remain a political force with varying degrees of power and influence on all continents, heading national governments in many countries around the world. today, many socialists have also adopted the causes of other social movements such as environmentalism, feminism and progressivism.while the emergence of the soviet union as the worlds first nominally socialist state led to socialisms widespread association with the soviet economic model, some economists and intellectuals argued that in practice the model functioned as a form of state capitalism or a non-planned administrative or command economy. academics, political commentators and other scholars tend to distinguish between authoritarian socialist and democratic socialist states, with the first representing the soviet bloc and the latter representing western bloc countries which have been democratically governed by socialist parties such as britain, france, sweden and western social-democracies in general, among others.for andrew vincent, ""he word socialism finds its root in the latin sociare, which means to combine or to share. the related, more technical term in roman and then medieval law was societas. this latter word could mean companionship and fellowship as well as the more legalistic idea of a consensual contract between freemen"".socialism was coined by henri de saint-simon, one of the founders of what would later be labelled utopian socialism. simon contrasted it to the liberal doctrine of individualism that emphasized the moral worth of the individual whilst stressing that people act or should act as if they are in isolation from one another. the original utopian socialists condemned this doctrine of individualism for failing to address social concerns during the industrial revolution, including poverty, oppression and vast wealth inequality. they viewed their society as harming community life by basing society on competition. they presented socialism as an alternative to liberal individualism based on the shared ownership of resources. saint-simon proposed economic planning, scientific administration and the application of scientific understanding to the organisation of society. by contrast, robert owen proposed to organise production and ownership via cooperatives. socialism is also attributed in france to pierre leroux and marie roch louis reybaud while in britain it is associated to owen, who became one of the fathers of the cooperative movement.the definition and usage of socialism settled by the 1860s, replacing associationist, co-operative and mutualist that had been used as synonyms while communism fell out of use during this period. an early distinction between communism and socialism was that the latter aimed to only socialise production while the former aimed to socialise both production and consumption  by 1888, marxists employed socialism in place of communism as the latter had come to be considered an old-fashion synonym for socialism. it was not until after the bolshevik revolution that socialism was appropriated by vladimir lenin to mean a stage between capitalism and communism. he used it to defend the bolshevik program from marxist criticism that russias productive forces were not sufficiently developed for communism. the distinction between communism and socialism became salient in 1918 after the russian social democratic labour party renamed itself to the all-russian communist party, interpreting communism specifically to mean socialists who supported the politics and theories of bolshevism, leninism and later that of marxism0s and 1830s. fourierists, owenites and saint-simonians and provided a series of analyses and interpretations of society. especially the owenites overlapped with other working-class movements such as the chartists in the united kingdom. the chartists gathered significant numbers around the peoples charter of 1838 which sought democratic reforms focused on the extension of suffrage to all male adults. leaders in the movement called for a more equitable distribution of income and better living conditions for the working classes. the first trade unions and consumer cooperative societies followed the chartist movement. pierre-joseph proudhon proposed his philosophy of mutualism in which ""everyone had an equal claim, either alone or as part of a small cooperative, to possess and use land and other resources as needed to make a living"". other currents inspired christian socialism ""often in britain and then usually coming out of left liberal politics and a romantic anti-industrialism"" which produced theorists such as edward bellamy, charles kingsley and frederick denison maurice.the first advocates of socialism favoured social levelling in order to create a meritocratic or technocratic society based on individual talent. henri de saint-simon was fascinated by the potential of science and technology and advocated a socialist society that would eliminate the disorderly aspects of capitalism based on equal opportunities. he sought a society in which each person was ranked according to his or her capacities and rewarded according to his or her work. his key focus was on administrative efficiency and industrialism and a belief that science was essential to progress. this was accompanied by a desire for a rationally organised economy based on planning and geared towards large-scale scientific and material progress. other early socialist thinkers such as charles hall and thomas hodgkin based their ideas on david ricardos economic theories. they reasoned that the equilibrium value of commodities approximated prices charged by the producer when those commodities were in elastic supply and that these producer prices corresponded to the embodied labour0th century. inspired by medieval guilds, theorists such as samuel george hobson and g. d. h. cole advocated the public ownership of industries and their workforces organisation into guilds, each of which under the democratic control of its trade union. guild socialists were less inclined than fabians to invest power in a state. at some point, like the american knights of labor, guild socialism wanted to abolish the wage system.as the ideas of marx and engels gained acceptance, particularly in central europe, socialists sought to unite in an international organisation. in 1889  it was termed the socialist international and engels was elected honorary president at the third congress in 1893. anarchists were banned, mainly due to pressure from marxists. it has been argued that at some point the second international turned ""into a battleground over the issue of libertarian versus authoritarian socialism. not only did they effectively present themselves as champions of minority rights; they also provoked the german marxists into demonstrating a dictatorial intolerance which was a factor in preventing the british labour movement from following the marxist direction indicated by such leaders as h. m. hyndman"".reformism arose as an alternative to revolution. eduard bernstein was a leading social democrat in germany who proposed the concept of evolutionary socialism. revolutionary socialists quickly targeted reformism: rosa luxemburg condemned bernsteins evolutionary socialism in her 1900 essay social reform or revolution? revolutionary socialism encompasses multiple social and political movements that may define ""revolution"" differently. the social democratic party of germany in argentina, the socialist party of argentina was established in the 1890s led by juan b. justo and nicol4 and 1940, it was a member of the labour and socialist international.in 1904, australians elected chris watson as the first australian labor party prime minister, becoming the first democratically elected socialist. in 1909, the first kibbutz was established in palestine by russian jewish immigrants. the kibbutz movement expanded through the 20th century following a doctrine of zionist socialism. the british labour party first won seats in the house of commons in 1902. the international socialist commission by 1917, the patriotism of world war i changed into political radicalism in australia, most of europe and the united states. other socialist parties from around the world who were beginning to gain importance in their national politics in the early 20th century included the italian socialist party, the french section of the workers international, the spanish socialist workers party, the swedish social democratic party, the russian social democratic labour party and the socialist party in argentina, the socialist workers party in chile and the socialist party of america in the united states.in february 1917, revolution exploded in russia. workers, soldiers and peasants established soviets upon arriving in petrograd, lenin declared that the revolution in russia had only begun, and that the next step was for the workers soviets to take full authority. he issued a thesis outlining the bolshevik programme, including rejection of any legitimacy in the provisional government and advocacy for state power to be administered through the soviets. the bolsheviks became the most influential force. on 7 november, the capitol of the provisional government was stormed by bolshevik red guards in what afterwards became known as the great october socialist revolution. the provisional government ended and the russian socialist federative soviet republic5 january 1918, lenin declared ""long live the world socialist revolution!"" at the petrograd soviet and proposed an immediate armistice on all fronts and transferred the land of the landed proprietors, the crown and the monasteries to the peasant committees without compensation.the day after assuming executive power on 25 january, lenin wrote draft regulations on workers control, which granted workers control of businesses with more than five workers and office employees and access to all books, documents and stocks and whose decisions were to be ""binding upon the owners of the enterprises"". governing through the elected soviets and in alliance with the peasant-based left socialist-revolutionaries, the bolshevik government began nationalising banks and industry; and disavowed the national debts of the deposed romanov royal r3. few communists doubted that the russian experience depended on successful, working-class socialist revolutions in developed capitalist countries. in 1919, lenin and trotsky organised the worlds communist parties into an international association of workers0, the red army under trotsky had largely defeated the royalist white armies. in 1921, war communism was ended and under the new economic policy  trotskys role was questioned by other socialists, including ex-trotskyists. in the united states, dwight macdonald broke with trotsky and left the trotskyist socialist workers party by noting the kronstadt rebellion, which trotsky and the other bolsheviks had brutally repressed. he then moved towards democratic socialism and anarchism.a similar critique of trotskys role in the kronstadt rebellion was raised by american anarchist emma goldman. in her essay ""trotsky protests too much"", she states, ""i admit, the dictatorship under stalins rule has become monstrous. that does not, however, lessen the guilt of leon trotsky as one of the actors in the revolutionary drama of which kronstadt was one of the bloodiest scenes"".in 1922, the fourth congress of the communist international took up the policy of the united front. it urged communists to work with rank and file social democrats while remaining critical of their leaders. they criticised those leaders for betraying the working class by supporting the capitalists war efforts. the social democrats pointed to the dislocation caused by revolution and later the growing authoritarianism of the communist parties. the labour party rejected the communist party of great britains application to affiliate to them in 1920.on seeing the soviet states growing coercive power in 1923, a dying lenin said russia had reverted to ""a bourgeois tsarist machine  barely varnished with socialism"". after lenins death in january 1924, the communist party of the soviet union4, the mongolian peoples republic was established and was ruled by the mongolian peoples party. the russian revolution and its aftermath motivated national communist parties elsewhere that gained political and social influence, in france, the united states, italy, china, mexico, the brazil, chile and indonesia.in spain in 1936, the national anarcho-syndicalist trade union confederaci5% of british industry was nationalised and that public employees, including those in nationalised industries, constituted a similar proportion of the countrys workers. the labour governments of 1964 to 1991, 1994 to 2006 and 2014 through 2023, most recently in a minority coalition. tage erlander was the first leader of the swedish social democratic party  swedish prime minister olof palme identified as a ""democratic socialist"" and was described as a ""revolutionary reformist"".the norwegian labour party was established in 1887 and was largely a trade union federation. the party did not proclaim a socialist agenda, elevating universal suffrage and dissolution of the union with sweden as its top priorities. in 1899, the norwegian confederation of trade unions separated from the labour party. around the time of the russian revolution, the labour party moved to the left and joined the communist international from 1919 through 1923. thereafter, the party still regarded itself as revolutionary, but the partys left-wing broke away and established the communist party of norway while the labour party gradually adopted a reformist line around 1930. in 1935, johan nygaardsvold established a coalition that lasted until 1945.from 1946 to 1962, the norwegian labour party held an absolute majority in the parliament led by einar gerhardsen, who remained prime minister for seventeen years. although the party abandoned most of its pre-war socialist ideas, the welfare state was expanded under gerhardsen to ensure the universal provision of basic human rights and stabilise the economy. in the 1945 norwegian parliamentary election, the communist party took 12% of the votes, but it largely vanished during the cold war. in the 1950s, popular socialism emerged in nordic countries. it placed itself between communism and social democracy. in the early 1960s, the socialist left party challenged the labour party from the left. also in the 1960s, gerhardsen established a planning agency and tried to establish a planned economy. in the 1970s, a more radical socialist party, the workers communist party in countries such as sweden, the rehn0th century, including the worlds first spacecraft and the first astronaut. the soviet economy was the modern worlds first centrally planned economy. it adopted state ownership of industry managed through gosplan  modernisation brought about a general increase in the standard of living.the eastern bloc was the group of communist states of central and eastern europe, including the soviet union and the countries of the warsaw pact, including poland, the german democratic republic, the hungary, bulgaria, czechoslovakia, romania, albania and yugoslavia. the hungarian revolution of 1956 was a spontaneous nationwide revolt against the communist government, lasting from 23 october until 10 november 1956. soviet leader nikita khrushchevs denunciation of the excesses of stalins regime during the twentieth communist party congress in 1956 as well as the hungarian revolt, produced disunity within western european communist and socialist parties.in the post-war years, socialism became increasingly influential in many then-developing countries. embracing third world socialism, countries in africa, asia and latin america often nationalised industries.the chinese communist revolution was the second stage in the chinese civil war, which ended with the establishment of the peoples republic of china led by the chinese communist party. the then-chinese kuomintang party in the 1920s incorporated chinese socialism as part of its ideology.the emergence of this new political entity in the frame of the cold war was complex and painful. several tentative efforts were made to organise newly independent states in order to establish a common front to limit the united states and the soviet unions influence on them. this led to the sino-soviet split. the non-aligned movement gathered around the figures of jawaharlal nehru of india, sukarno of indonesia, josip broz tito of yugoslavia and gamal abdel nasser of egypt. after the 1954 geneva conference which ended the french war in vietnam, the 1955 bandung conference gathered nasser, nehru, tito, sukarno and chinese premier zhou enlai. as many african countries gained independence during the 1960s, some of them rejected capitalism in favour of african socialism as defined by julius nyerere of tanzania, l to 1980 and from 1989 to 1992. according to opinion polls, he remains one of jamaicas most popular prime ministers since independence. the nicaraguan revolution encompassed the rising opposition to the somoza dictatorship in the 1960s and 1970s, the campaign led by the sandinista national liberation front  and the socialist measures which included wide-scale agrarian reform and educational programs. the peoples revolutionary government was proclaimed on 13 march 1979 in grenada which was overthrown by armed forces of the united states in 1983. the salvadoran civil war in italy, autonomia operaia was a leftist movement particularly active from 1976 to 1978. it took an important role in the autonomist movement in the 1970s, aside earlier organisations such as potere operaio  this experience prompted the contemporary socialist radical movement autonomism. in 1982, the newly elected french socialist government of fran. chinese communist party general secretary jiang zemin, premiers li peng and zhu rongji led the nation in the 1990s. under their administration, chinas economic performance pulled an estimated 150%. at the sixth national congress of the communist party of vietnam in december 1986, reformist politicians replaced the ""old guard"" government with new leadership. the reformers were led by 71-year-old nguyen van linh, who became the partys new general secretary. linh and the reformers implemented a series of free market reforms005, although some are still far behind that. these developments led to increased nationalist sentiment and nostalgia for the communist era.many social democratic parties, particularly after the cold war, adopted neoliberal market policies including privatisation, deregulation and financialisation. they abandoned their pursuit of moderate socialism in favour of economic liberalism. by the 1980s, with the rise of conservative neoliberal politicians such as ronald reagan in the united states, margaret thatcher in britain, brian mulroney in canada and augusto pinochet in chile, the western welfare state was attacked from within, but state support for the corporate sector was maintained. monetarists and neoliberals attacked social welfare systems as impediments to private entrepreneurship. in the united kingdom, labour party leader neil kinnock made a public attack against the entryist group militant at the 1985 labour party conference. labour ruled that militant was ineligible for affiliation with the party and it gradually expelled militant supporters. the kinnock leadership had refused to support the 1984009 omits all mention of communism.although the authority of the state remained unchallenged under 008 general election. in 2010, there were 270 kibbutzim in israel. their factories and farms account for 9% of israels industrial output, worth us$8010, kibbutz sasa, containing some 200 members, generated $850013 shows that the happiest nations are concentrated in northern europe, where the nordic model is employed, with denmark topping the list. this is at times attributed to the success of the nordic model in the region that has been labelled social democratic in contrast with the conservative continental model and the liberal anglo-american model. the nordic countries ranked highest on the metrics of real gdp per capita, healthy life expectancy, having someone to count on, perceived freedom to make life choices, generosity and freedom from corruption.the objectives of the party of european socialists, the european parliaments socialist and social democratic bloc, are now ""to pursue international aims in respect of the principles on which the european union is based, namely principles of freedom, equality, solidarity, democracy, respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms, and respect for the rule of law"". as a result, today the rallying cry of the french

election joe higgins of the socialist party took one of three seats in the capital dublin european constituency.in denmark, the socialist peoples party  in 2011, the social democrats, socialist peoples party and the danish social liberal party formed government, after a slight victory over the main rival political coalition. they were led by helle thorning-schmidt, and had the red-green alliance as a supporting party.in norway, the red-green coalition consists of the labour party  whose success has sent ""shock-waves across the eu"".in the united kingdom, the national union of rail, maritime and transport workers put forward a slate of candidates in the 2009 european parliament elections under the banner of no to eu 010 united kingdom general election, the trade unionist and

contested the 2011 local elections, having gained the endorsement of the rmt june 2010 conference, but gained no seats. left unity was also founded in 2013 after the film director ken loach appealed for a new party of the left to replace the labour party, which he claimed had failed to oppose austerity and had shifted towards neoliberalism. in 2015, following a defeat at the 2015 united kingdom general election, self-described socialist jeremy corbyn took over from ed miliband as leader of the labour party.in france, olivier besancenot, the revolutionary communist league  the lcr abolished itself in 2009 to initiate a broad anti-capitalist party, the new anticapitalist party, whose stated aim is to ""build a new socialist, democratic perspective for the twenty-first century"".on 25 may 2014, the spanish left-wing party podemos entered candidates for the 2014 european parliamentary elections, some of which were unemployed. in a surprise result, it polled 7.98% of the vote and thus was awarded five seats out of 54 while the older united left was the third largest overall force obtaining 10.03% and 5 seats, 4 more than the previous elections.the government of portugal established on 26 november 2015 was a socialist party all around europe and in some places of latin america there exists a social centre and squatting movement mainly inspired by autonomist and anarchist ideas.according to a 2013 article in the guardian, ""ontrary to popular belief, americans dont have an innate allergy to socialism. milwaukee has had several socialist mayors  sanders, once mayor of vermonts largest city, burlington, has described himself as a democratic socialist and has praised scandinavian-style social democracy. in 2016, sanders made a bid for the democratic party presidential candidate, thereby gaining considerable popular support, particularly among the younger generation, but lost the nomination to hillary clinton. as of 2019, the democratic socialists of america have two members in congress, and various members in state legislatures and city councils. according to a 2018 gallup poll, 37% of american adults have a positive view of socialism, including 57% of democrat-leaning voters and 16% of republican-leaning voters. a 2019 yougov poll found that 7 out of 10 millennials would vote for a socialist presidential candidate, and 36% had a favorable view of communism. an earlier 2019 harris poll found that socialism is more popular with women than men, with 55% of women between the ages of 18 and 54 preferring to live in a socialist society while a majority of men surveyed in the poll chose capitalism over socialism.anti-capitalism, anarchism and the anti-globalisation movement rose to prominence through events such as protests against the world trade organization ministerial conference of 1999 in seattle. socialist-inspired groups played an important role in these movements, which nevertheless embraced much broader layers of the population and were championed by figures such as noam chomsky. in canada, the co-operative commonwealth federation in their johnson linguistics column, the economist opines that in the 21st century united states, the term socialism, without clear definition, has become a pejorative used by conservatives to attack liberal and progressive policies, proposals, and public figures.for the

and authoritarianism. the pink tide was followed in the 2010s by a ""conservative wave"" as right-wing governments came to power in argentina, brazil and chile, and venezuela and nicaragua experienced political crises. however, socialism saw a resurgence in 20181st century, especially amongst youth. it is strongest in victoria, where three socialist parties have merged into the victorian socialists, who aim to address problems in housing and public transportation.in new zealand, socialism emerged within the budding trade union movement during the late 19th century and early 20th century. in july 1916, several left-wing political organisations and trade unions merged to form the new zealand labour party. while labour traditionally had a socialist orientation, the party shifted towards a more social democratic orientation during the 1920s and 1930s. following the 1935 general election, the first labour government pursued socialist policies such as nationalising industry, broadcasting, transportation, and implementing a keynesian welfare state. however, the party did not seek to abolish capitalism, instead opting for a mixed economy. labours welfare state and mixed economy were not challenged until the 1980s. during the 1980s, the fourth labour government implemented a raft of neoliberal economic reforms known as rogernomics which saw new zealand society and the economy shift towards a more free market model. labours abandonment of its traditional values fractured the party. successive labour governments have since pursued centre-left social and economic policies while maintaining a free-market economy. the current prime minister of new zealand jacinda ardern formerly served as president of the international union of socialist youth. ardern is a self-described social democrat who has criticized capitalism as a ""blatant failure"" due to high levels of homelessness and low wages. new zealand still has a small socialist scene, mainly dominated by trotskyist groups.melanesian socialism developed in the 1980s, inspired by african socialism. it aims to achieve full independence from britain and france in melanesian territories and creation of a melanesian federal union. it is very popular with the new caledonia independence movement.the progressive alliance is a political international founded on 22 may 2013 by political parties, the majority of whom are current or former members of the socialist international. the organisation states the aim of becoming the global network of ""the progressive, democratic, social-democratic, socialist and labour movement"".early socialist thought took influences from a diverse range of philosophies such as civic republicanism, enlightenment rationalism, romanticism, forms of materialism, christianity  another philosophical basis for a lot of early socialism was the emergence of positivism during the european enlightenment. positivism held that both the natural and social worlds could be understood through scientific knowledge and be analysed using scientific methods. this core outlook influenced early social scientists and different types of socialists ranging from anarchists like peter kropotkin to technocrats like saint simon.the fundamental objective of socialism is to attain an advanced level of material production and therefore greater productivity, efficiency and rationality as compared to capitalism and all previous systems, under the view that an expansion of human productive capability is the basis for the extension of freedom and equality in society. many forms of socialist theory hold that human behaviour is largely shaped by the social environment. in particular, socialism holds that social mores, values, cultural traits and economic practices are social creations and not the result of an immutable natural law. the object of their critique is thus not human avarice or human consciousness, but the material conditions and man-made social systems socialists view creativity as an essential aspect of human nature and define freedom as a state of being where individuals are able to express their creativity unhindered by constraints of both material scarcity and coercive social institutions. the socialist concept of individuality is intertwined with the concept of individual creative expression. karl marx believed that expansion of the productive forces and technology was the basis for the expansion of human freedom and that socialism, being a system that is consistent with modern developments in technology, would enable the flourishing of ""free individualities"" through the progressive reduction of necessary labour time. the reduction of necessary labour time to a minimum would grant individuals the opportunity to pursue the development of their true individuality and creativity.socialists argue that the accumulation of capital generates waste through externalities that require costly corrective regulatory measures. they also point out that this process generates wasteful industries and practices that exist only to generate sufficient demand for products such as high-pressure advertisement to be sold at a profit, thereby creating rather than satisfying economic demand.socialists argue that capitalism consists of irrational activity, such as the purchasing of commodities only to sell at a later time when their price appreciates, rather than for consumption, even if the commodity cannot be sold at a profit to individuals in need and therefore a crucial criticism often made by socialists is that ""making money"", or accumulation of capital, does not correspond to the satisfaction of demand  the fundamental criterion for economic activity in capitalism is the accumulation of capital for reinvestment in production, but this spurs the development of new, non-productive industries that do not produce use-value and only exist to keep the accumulation process afloat socialists view private property relations as limiting the potential of productive forces in the economy. according to socialists, private property becomes obsolete when it concentrates into centralised, socialised institutions based on private appropriation of revenue0th century, where it was combined with a single-party political system. in a centrally planned economy, decisions regarding the quantity of goods and services to be produced are planned in advance by a planning agency  studies by economists of various political persuasions on the actual functioning of the soviet economy indicate that it was not actually a planned economy. instead of conscious planning, the soviet economy was based on a process whereby the plan was modified by localised agents and the original plans went largely unfulfilled. planning agencies, ministries and enterprises all adapted and bargained with each other during the formulation of the plan as opposed to following a plan passed down from a higher authority, leading some economists to suggest that planning did not actually take place within the soviet economy and that a better description would be an ""administered"" or ""managed"" economy.although central planning was largely supported by marxist0th century. it was strongly associated with g. d. h. cole and influenced by the ideas of william morris.one such system is the cooperative economy, a largely free market economy in which workers manage the firms and democratically determine remuneration levels and labour divisions. productive resources would be legally owned by the cooperative and rented to the workers, who would enjoy usufruct rights. another form of decentralised planning is the use of cybernetics, or the use of computers to manage the allocation of economic inputs. the socialist-run government of salvador allende in chile experimented with project cybersyn, a real-time information bridge between the government, state enterprises and consumers. another, more recent variant is participatory economics, wherein the economy is planned by decentralised councils of workers and consumers. workers would be remunerated solely according to effort and sacrifice, so that those engaged in dangerous, uncomfortable and strenuous work would receive the highest incomes and could thereby work less. a contemporary model for a self-managed, non-market socialism is pat devines model of negotiated coordination. negotiated coordination is based upon social ownership by those affected by the use of the assets involved, with decisions made by those at the most localised level of production.michel bauwens identifies the emergence of the open software movement and peer-to-peer production as a new alternative mode of production to the capitalist economy and centrally planned economy that is based on collaborative self-management, common ownership of resources and the production of use-values through the free cooperation of producers who have access to distributed capital.anarcho-communism is a theory of anarchism which advocates the abolition of the state, private property and capitalism in favour of common ownership of the means of production. anarcho-syndicalism was practised in catalonia and other places in the spanish revolution during the spanish civil war. sam dolgoff estimated that about eight million people participated directly or at least indirectly in the spanish revolution.the economy of the former socialist federal republic of yugoslavia established a system based on market-based allocation, social ownership of the means of production and self-management within firms. this system substituted yugoslavias soviet-type central planning with a decentralised, self-managed system after reforms in 1953.the marxian economist richard d. wolff argues that ""re-organising production so that workers become collectively self-directed at their work-sites"" not only moves society beyond both capitalism and state socialism of the last century, but would also mark another milestone in human history, similar to earlier transitions out of slavery and feudalism. as an example, wolff claims that mondragon is ""a stunningly successful alternative to the capitalist organisation of production"".state socialism can be used to classify any variety of socialist philosophies that advocates the ownership of the means of production by the state apparatus, either as a transitional stage between capitalism and socialism, or as an end-goal in itself. typically, it refers to a form of technocratic management, whereby technical specialists administer or manage economic enterprises on behalf of society and the public interest instead of workers councils or workplace democracy.a state-directed economy may refer to a type of mixed economy consisting of public ownership over large industries, as promoted by various social democratic political parties during the 20th century. this ideology influenced the policies of the british labour party during clement attlees administration. in the biography of the 1945 united kingdom labour party prime minister clement attlee, francis beckett states: ""he government  wanted what would become known as a mixed economy"".nationalisation in the united kingdom was achieved through compulsory purchase of the industry market socialism consists of publicly owned or cooperatively owned enterprises operating in a market economy. it is a system that uses the market and monetary prices for the allocation and accounting of the means of production, thereby retaining the process of capital accumulation. the profit generated would be used to directly remunerate employees, collectively sustain the enterprise or finance public institutions. in state-oriented forms of market socialism, in which state enterprises attempt to maximise profit, the profits can be used to fund government programs and services through a social dividend, eliminating or greatly diminishing the need for various forms of taxation that exist in capitalist systems. neoclassical economist l005. although there has been a rapid expansion of private-sector activity since the 1980s, privatisation of state assets was virtually halted and were partially reversed in 2005. the current chinese economy consists of 150 corporatised state-owned enterprises that report directly to chinas central government. by 2008, these state-owned corporations had become increasingly dynamic and generated large increases in revenue for the state, resulting in a state-sector led recovery during the 2009 financial crises while accounting for most of chinas economic growth. however, the chinese economic model is widely cited as a contemporary form of state capitalism, the major difference between western capitalism and the chinese model being the degree of state-ownership of shares in publicly listed corporations.the socialist republic of vietnam has adopted a similar model after the doi moi economic renovation, but slightly differs from the chinese model in that the vietnamese government retains firm control over the state sector and strategic industries, but allows for private-sector activity in commodity production.while major socialist political movements include anarchism, communism, the labour movement, marxism, social democracy and syndicalism, independent socialist theorists, utopian socialist authors and academic supporters of socialism may not be represented in these movements. some political groups have called themselves socialist while holding views that some consider antithetical to socialism. the term socialist has also been used by some politicians on the political right as an epithet against certain individuals who do not consider themselves to be socialists and against policies that are not considered socialist by their proponents. there are many variations of socialism and as such there is no single definition encapsulating all of socialism. however, there have been common elements identified by scholars.in his dictionary of socialism in the concepts of socialism  in his study ideologies and political theory anarchism advocates stateless societies often defined as self-governed voluntary institutions, but that several authors have defined as more specific institutions based on non-hierarchical free associations. while anarchism holds the state to be undesirable, unnecessary or harmful, it is not the central aspect. anarchism entails opposing authority or hierarchical organisation in the conduct of human relations, including the state system. mutualists support market socialism, collectivist anarchists favour workers cooperatives and salaries based on the amount of time contributed to production, anarcho-communists advocate a direct transition from capitalism to libertarian communism and a gift economy and anarcho-syndicalists prefer workers direct action and the general strike.the authoritarian of the anarchists, who went on to lead the anti-authoritarian international and then founded their own libertarian international, the anarchist st. imier international. in 1888, the individualist anarchist benjamin tucker, who proclaimed himself to be an anarchistic socialist and libertarian socialist in opposition to the authoritarian state socialism and the compulsory communism, included the full text of a ""socialistic letter"" by ernest lesigne in his essay on ""state socialism and anarchism"". according to lesigne, there are two types of socialism: ""one is dictatorial, the other libertarian"". tuckers two socialisms were the authoritarian state socialism which he associated to the marxist school and the libertarian anarchist socialism, or simply anarchism, that he advocated. tucker noted that the fact that the authoritarian ""state socialism has overshadowed other forms of socialism gives it no right to a monopoly of the socialistic idea"". according to tucker, what those two schools of socialism had in common was the labor theory of value and the ends, by which anarchism pursued different means.according to anarchists such as the authors of an anarchist faq, anarchism is one of the many traditions of socialism. for anarchists and other anti-authoritarian socialists, socialism ""can only mean a classless and anti-authoritarian  michael newman includes anarchism as one of many socialist traditions. peter marshall argues that ""n general anarchism is closer to socialism than liberalism.  anarchism finds itself largely in the socialist camp, but it also has outriders in liberalism. it cannot be reduced to socialism, and is best seen as a separate and distinctive doctrine"".0th century. it was described by jerry mander as ""hybrid economics"", an active collaboration of capitalist and socialist visions. numerous studies and surveys indicate that people tend to live happier lives in social democratic societies rather than neoliberal ones.social democrats advocate for a peaceful, evolutionary transition of the economy to socialism through progressive social reform. it asserts that the only acceptable constitutional form of government is representative democracy under the rule of law. it promotes extending democratic decision-making beyond political democracy to include economic democracy to guarantee employees and other economic stakeholders sufficient rights of co-determination. it supports a mixed economy that opposes inequality, poverty and oppression while rejecting both a totally unregulated market economy or a fully planned economy. common social democratic policies include universal social rights and universally accessible public services such as education, health care, workers compensation and other services, including child care and elder care. social democracy supports the trade union labour movement and supports collective bargaining rights for workers. most social democratic parties are affiliated with the socialist international.modern democratic socialism is a broad political movement that seeks to promote the ideals of socialism within the context of a democratic system. some democratic socialists support social democracy as a temporary measure to reform the current system while others reject reformism in favour of more revolutionary methods. modern social democracy emphasises a program of gradual legislative modification of capitalism in order to make it more equitable and humane while the theoretical end goal of building a socialist society is relegated to the indefinite future. according to sheri berman, marxism is loosely held to be valuable for its emphasis on changing the world for a more just, better future.the two movements are widely similar both in terminology and in ideology, although there are a few key differences. the major difference between social democracy and democratic socialism is the object of their politics in that contemporary social democrats support a welfare state and unemployment insurance as well as other practical, progressive reforms of capitalism and are more concerned to administrate and humanise it. on the other hand, democratic socialists seek to replace capitalism with a socialist economic system, arguing that any attempt to humanise capitalism through regulations and welfare policies would distort the market and create economic contradictions.ethical socialism appeals to socialism on ethical and moral grounds as opposed to economic, egoistic and consumeristic grounds. it emphasizes the need for a morally conscious economy based upon the principles of altruism, cooperation and social justice while opposing possessive individualism. ethical socialism has been the official philosophy of mainstream socialist parties.liberal socialism incorporates liberal principles to socialism. it has been compared to post-war social democracy for its support of a mixed economy that includes both public and private capital goods. while democratic socialism and social democracy are anti-capitalist positions insofar as criticism of capitalism is linked to the private ownership of the means of production, liberal socialism identifies artificial and legalistic monopolies to be the fault of capitalism and opposes an entirely unregulated market economy. it considers both liberty and social equality to be compatible and mutually dependent.principles that can be described as ethical or liberal socialist have been based upon or developed by philosophers such as john stuart mill, eduard bernstein, john dewey, carlo rosselli, norberto bobbio and chantal mouffe. other important liberal socialist figures include guido calogero, piero gobetti, leonard trelawny hobhouse, john maynard keynes and r. h. tawney. liberal socialism has been particularly prominent in british and italian politics.blanquism is a conception of revolution named for louis auguste blanqui. it holds that socialist revolution should be carried out by a relatively small group of highly organised and secretive conspirators. upon seizing power, the revolutionaries introduce socialism. rosa luxemburg and eduard bernstein criticised lenin, stating that his conception of revolution was elitist and blanquist. marxism0th centuries, both clara zetkin and eleanor marx were against the demonisation of men and supported a proletariat revolution that would overcome as many male-female inequalities as possible. as their movement already had the most radical demands in womens equality, most marxist leaders, including clara zetkin and alexandra kollontai, counterposed marxism against liberal feminism rather than trying to combine them. anarcha-feminism began with late 19th- and early 20th-century authors and theorists such as anarchist feminists goldman and voltairine de cleyre in the spanish civil war, an anarcha-feminist group, mujeres libres  in 1972, the chicago womens liberation union published ""socialist feminism: a strategy for the womens movement"", which is believed to be the first published use of the term ""socialist feminism"".many socialists were early advocates for lgbt rights. for early socialist charles fourier, true freedom could only occur without suppressing passions, as the suppression of passions is not only destructive to the individual, but to society as a whole. writing before the advent of the term ""homosexuality"", fourier recognised that both men and women have a wide range of sexual needs and preferences which may change throughout their lives, including same-sex sexuality and androg\xc3\xa9nit\xc3\xa9. he argued that all sexual expressions should be enjoyed as long as people are not abused and that ""affirming ones difference"" can actually enhance social integration. in oscar wildes the soul of man under socialism, he advocates for an egalitarian society where wealth is shared by all, while warning of the dangers of social systems that crush individuality. edward carpenter actively campaigned for homosexual rights. his work the intermediate sex: a study of some transitional types of men and women was a 1908 book arguing for gay liberation. who was an influential personality in the foundation of the fabian society and the labour party. after the russian revolution under the leadership of lenin and trotsky, the soviet union abolished previous laws against homosexuality. harry hay was an early leader in the american lgbt rights movement as well as a member of the communist party usa. he is known for his roles in helping to found gay organisations, including the mattachine society, the first sustained gay rights group in the united states which in its early days reflected a strong marxist influence. the encyclopedia of homosexuality reports that ""s marxists the founders of the group believed that the injustice and oppression which they suffered stemmed from relationships deeply embedded in the structure of american society"". emerging from events such as the may 1968 insurrection in france, the anti-vietnam war movement in the us and the stonewall riots of 1969, militant gay liberation organisations began to spring up around the world. many sprang from left radicalism more than established homophile groups, although the gay liberation front took an anti-capitalist stance and attacked the nuclear family and traditional gender roles.eco-socialism is a political strain merging aspects of socialism, marxism or libertarian socialism with green politics, ecology and alter-globalisation. eco-socialists generally claim that the expansion of the capitalist system is the cause of social exclusion, poverty, war and environmental degradation through globalisation and imperialism under the supervision of repressive states and transnational structures. contrary to the depiction of karl marx by some environmentalists, social ecologists and fellow socialists as a productivist who favoured the domination of nature, eco-socialists revisited marxs writings and believe that he ""was a main originator of the ecological world-view"". marx discussed a ""metabolic rift"" between man and nature, stating that ""private ownership of the globe by single individuals will appear quite absurd as private ownership of one man by another"" and his observation that a society must ""hand it  down to succeeding generations in an improved condition"". english socialist william morris is credited with developing principles of what was later called eco-socialism. during the 1880s and 1890s, morris promoted his ideas within the social democratic federation and socialist league. green anarchism blends anarchism with environmental issues. an important early influence was henry david thoreau and his book walden as well as \xc3\xa9lis\xc3\xa9e reclus.in the late 19th century, anarcho-naturism fused anarchism and naturist philosophies within individualist anarchist circles in france, spain, cuba and portugal. murray bookchins first book our synthetic environment was followed by his essay ""ecology and revolutionary thought"" which introduced ecology as a concept in radical politics. in the 1970s, barry commoner, claimed that capitalist technologies were chiefly responsible for environmental degradation as opposed to population pressures. in the 1990s socialist/feminists mary mellor and ariel salleh adopt an eco-socialist paradigm. an ""environmentalism of the poor"" combining ecological awareness and social justice has also become prominent. pepper critiqued the current approach of many within green politics, particularly deep ecologists.many green parties around the world such as the dutch green left party syndicalism operates through industrial trade unions. it rejects state socialism and the use of establishment politics. syndicalists reject state power in favour of strategies such as the general strike. syndicalists advocate a socialist economy based on federated unions or syndicates of workers who own and manage the means of production. some marxist currents advocate syndicalism, such as de leonism. anarcho-syndicalism views syndicalism as a method for workers in capitalist society to gain control of an economy. the spanish revolution was largely orchestrated by the anarcho-syndicalist trade union cnt. the international workers association is an international federation of anarcho-syndicalist labour unions and initiatives.socialism is criticized in terms of its models of economic organization as well as its political and social implications. other critiques are directed at the socialist movement, parties or existing states. some criticisms occupy theoretical grounds ",1,0
"economics  is the social science that studies how people interact with value; in particular, the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services.economics focuses on the behaviour and interactions of economic agents and how economies work. microeconomics analyzes basic elements in the economy, including individual agents and markets, their interactions, and the outcomes of interactions. individual agents may include, for example, households, firms, buyers, and sellers. macroeconomics analyzes the economy as a system where production, consumption, saving, and investment interact,  and factors affecting it: employment of the resources of labour, capital, and land, currency inflation, economic growth, and public policies that have impact on these elements.other broad distinctions within economics include those between positive economics, describing ""what is"", and normative economics, advocating ""what ought to be""; between economic theory and applied economics; between rational and behavioural economics; and between mainstream economics and heterodox economics.economic analysis can be applied throughout society, in real estate, business, finance, health care, and government. economic analysis is sometimes also applied to such diverse subjects as crime, education, the family, law, politics, religion, social institutions, war, science, and the environment.the discipline was renamed in the late 19th century, primarily due to alfred marshall, from ""political economy"" to ""economics"" as a shorter term for ""economic science"". at that time, it became more open to rigorous thinking and made increased use of mathematics, which helped support efforts to have it accepted as a science and as a separate discipline outside of political science and other social sciences.there are a variety of modern definitions of economics; some reflect evolving views of the subject or different views among economists. scottish philosopher adam smith  a plentiful revenue or subsistence for the people0th century, neoclassical theorists moved away from an earlier notion suggesting that total utility for a society could be measured in favour of ordinal utility, which hypothesizes merely behaviour-based relations across persons.in microeconomics, neoclassical economics represents incentives and costs as playing a pervasive role in shaping decision making. an immediate example of this is the consumer theory of individual demand, which isolates how prices  in macroeconomics it is reflected in an early and lasting neoclassical synthesis with keynesian macroeconomics.neoclassical economics is occasionally referred as orthodox economics whether by its critics or sympathizers. modern mainstream economics builds on neoclassical economics but with many refinements that either supplement or generalize earlier analysis, such as econometrics, game theory, analysis of market failure and imperfect competition, and the neoclassical model of economic growth for analysing long-run variables affecting national income.neoclassical economics studies the behaviour of individuals, households, and organizations  they are the focus of economic analysis.an approach to understanding these processes, through the study of agent behaviour under scarcity, may go as follows:the continuous interplay  each period, as if they were in a giant feedback system, economic players influence the pricing processes and the economy, and are in turn influenced by them until a steady state keynesian economics derives from john maynard keynes, in particular his book the general theory of employment, interest and money  the book focused on determinants of national income in the short run when prices are relatively inflexible. keynes attempted to explain in broad theoretical detail why high labour-market unemployment might not be self-correcting due to low ""effective demand"" and why even price flexibility and monetary policy might be unavailing. the term ""revolutionary"" has been applied to the book in its impact on economic analysis.keynesian economics has two successors. post-keynesian economics also concentrates on macroeconomic rigidities and adjustment processes. research on micro foundations for their models is represented as based on real-life practices rather than simple optimizing models. it is generally associated with the university of cambridge and the work of joan robinson.new-keynesian economics is also associated with developments in the keynesian fashion. within this group researchers tend to share with other economists the emphasis on models employing micro foundations and optimizing behaviour but with a narrower focus on standard keynesian themes such as price and wage rigidity. these are usually made to be endogenous features of the models, rather than simply assumed as in older keynesian-style ones.the chicago school of economics is best known for its free market advocacy and monetarist ideas. according to milton friedman and monetarists, market economies are inherently stable if the money supply does not greatly expand or contract. ben bernanke, former chairman of the federal reserve, is among the economists today generally accepting friedmans analysis of the causes of the great depression.milton friedman effectively took many of the basic principles set forth by adam smith and the classical economists and modernized them. one example of this is his article in the 13 september 1970 issue of the new york times magazine, in which he claims that the social responsibility of business should be ""to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits009 that this was no longer the case, and that modelling had improved significantly in both theoretical rigour and empiricism, with a strong focus on testable quantitative work.in the 1990s, feminist critiques of neoclassical economic models gained prominence, leading to the formation of feminist economics. feminist economists call attention to the social construction of economics and claims to highlight the ways in which its models and methods reflect masculine preferences. primary criticisms focus on alleged failures to account for: the selfish nature of actors economics is one social science among several and has fields bordering on other areas, including economic geography, economic history, public choice, energy economics, cultural economics, family economics and institutional economics.law and economics, or economic analysis of law, is an approach to legal theory that applies methods of economics to law. it includes the use of economic concepts to explain the effects of legal rules, to assess which legal rules are economically efficient, and to predict what the legal rules will be. a seminal article by ronald coase published in 1961 suggested that well-defined property rights could overcome the problems of externalities.political economy is the interdisciplinary study that combines economics, law, and political science in explaining how political institutions, the political environment, and the economic system  historians have employed political economy to explore the ways in the past that persons and groups with common economic interests have used politics to effect changes beneficial to their interests.energy economics is a broad scientific subject area which includes topics related to energy supply and energy demand. georgescu-roegen reintroduced the concept of entropy in relation to economics and energy from thermodynamics, as distinguished from what he viewed as the mechanistic foundation of neoclassical economics drawn from newtonian physics. his work contributed significantly to thermoeconomics and to ecological economics. he also did foundational work which later developed into evolutionary economics.the sociological subfield of economic sociology arose, primarily through the work of 002 for his and amos tverskys empirical discovery of several cognitive biases and heuristics. similar empirical testing occurs in neuroeconomics. another example is the assumption of narrowly selfish preferences versus a model that tests for selfish, altruistic, and cooperative preferences. these techniques have led some to argue that economics is a ""genuine science"".the professionalization of economics, reflected in the growth of graduate programmes on the subject, has been described as ""the main change in economics since around 1900"". most major universities and many colleges have a major, school, or department in which academic degrees are awarded in the subject, whether in the liberal arts, business, or for professional study.see bachelor of economics and master of economics.in the private sector, professional economists are employed as consultants and in industry, including banking and finance. economists also work for various government departments and agencies, for example, the national treasury, central bank or bureau of statistics.there are dozens of prizes awarded to economists each year for outstanding intellectual contributions to the field, the most prominent of which is the nobel memorial prize in economic sciences, though it is not a nobel prize.",1,0
"chess is a two-player strategy board game played on a chessboard, a checkered board with 64006 and 2010 asian games. there is also a correspondence chess world championship and a world computer chess championship. online chess has opened amateur and professional competition to a wide and varied group of players.since the second half of the 20th century, chess engines have been programmed to play with increasing success, to the point that many programs play at a higher level than the best human players. since the 1990s, computer analysis has contributed significantly to chess theory, particularly in the endgame. the ibm computer deep blue was the first machine to overcome a reigning world chess champion in a match when it defeated garry kasparov in 1997. the rise of strong chess engines, runnable on hand-held devices, has led to increasing concern about cheating during tournaments.there are many variants of chess that utilize different rules, pieces, or chessboards. one of these, fischer random chess, has gained widespread popularity as well as official fide recognition.the rules of chess are published by fide  rules published by national governing bodies, or by unaffiliated chess organizations, commercial publishers, etc., may differ. fides rules were most recently revised in 2018.by convention, chess game pieces are divided into white and black sets. each set consists of 16 pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns. the pieces are set out as shown in the diagram and photo. the players of the sets are referred to as white and black, respectively.the game is played on a square board of eight rows when a pawn makes a two-step advance from its starting position and there is an opponents pawn on a square next to the destination square on an adjacent file, then the opponents pawn can capture it en passant games can be won in the following ways:there are several ways games can end in a draw:in competition, chess games are played with a time control. if a players time runs out before the game is completed, the game is automatically lost  where its early form in the 6th00, the rules of shatranj started to be modified in southern europe, and around 1475, several major changes made the game essentially as it is known today. these modern rules for the basic moves had been adopted in italy and spain. pawns gained the option of advancing two squares on their first move, while bishops and queens acquired their modern abilities. the queen replaced the earlier vizier chess piece towards the end of the 10th4. chess problems became a regular part of 19th-century newspapers; bernhard horwitz, josef kling, and samuel loyd composed some of the most influential problems. in 1843, von der lasa published his and bilguers handbuch des schachspiels  sparkling games like anderssens immortal game and evergreen game or morphys ""opera game"" were regarded as the highest possible summit of the chess art.the romantic era was characterized by opening gambits prague-born wilhelm steinitz beginning in 1873 described how to avoid weaknesses in ones own position and how to create and exploit such weaknesses in the opponents position. the scientific approach and positional understanding of steinitz revolutionized the game. steinitz was the first to break a position down into its components. before steinitz, players brought their queen out early, did not completely develop their other pieces, and mounted a quick attack on the opposing king, which either succeeded or failed. the level of defense was poor and players did not form any deep plan. in addition to his theoretical achievements, steinitz founded an important tradition: his triumph over the leading german master johannes zukertort in 1886 is regarded as the first official world chess championship. steinitz lost his crown in 1894 to a much younger player, the german mathematician emanuel lasker, who maintained this title for 274, and fide was founded initially for the purpose of organizing that event.  in 1927, the womens world chess championship was established; the first to hold the title was czech-english master vera menchik.a prodigy from cuba, jos1. capablanca was undefeated in tournament play for eight years, from 1916 to 1924. his successor between the world wars, chess was revolutionized by the new theoretical school of so-called hypermodernists like aron nimzowitsch and richard r3-year-old latvian prodigy mikhail tal, an accomplished tactician and attacking player. botvinnik again regained the title in a rematch in 1961.following the 1961 event, fide abolished the automatic right of a deposed champion to a rematch, and the next champion, armenian tigran petrosian, a player renowned for his defensive and positional skills, held the title for two cycles, 1963006, in which kramnik beat the fide world champion veselin topalov, reunified the titles and made kramnik the undisputed world chess champion. in september 2007, he lost the title to viswanathan anand of india, who won the championship tournament in mexico city. anand defended his title in the revenge match of 2008, 2010 and 2012. in 2013, magnus carlsen of norway beat anand in the 2013 world chess championship. he defended his title the following year, again against anand. carlsen confirmed his title in 2016 against the russian sergey karjakin and in 2018 against the american fabiano caruana, in both occasions by a rapid tiebreaker match after equality in 12 games of classical time control, and is the reigning world champion.noble chess players, germany, c.0two kings and two queens from the lewis chessmen  gentlemen are ""to be meanly seene in the play at chestes"", says the overview at the beginning of baldassare castigliones the book of the courtier many of the elaborate chess sets used by the aristocracy have been lost, but others partially survive, such as the lewis chessmen.chess was often used as a basis of sermons on morality. an example is liber de moribus hominum et officiis nobilium sive super ludo scacchorum  the work was translated into many other languages  different chess pieces were used as metaphors for different classes of people, and human duties were derived from the rules of the game or from visual properties of the chess pieces:the knyght ought to be made alle armed upon an hors in suche wyse that he haue an helme on his heed and a spere in his ryght hande/ and coueryd wyth his sheld/ a swerde and a mace on his lyft syde/ cladd wyth an hawberk and plates to fore his breste/ legge harnoys on his legges/ spores on his heelis on his handes his gauntelettes/ his hors well broken and taught and apte to bataylle and couerid with his armes/ whan the knyghtes ben maad they ben bayned or bathed/ that is the signe that they shold lede a newe lyf and newe maners/ also they wake alle the nyght in prayers and orysons vnto god that he wylle gyue hem grace that they may gete that thynge that they may not gete by nature/ the kynge or prynce gyrdeth a boute them a swerde in signe/ that they shold abyde and kepe hym of whom they take theyr dispenses and dignyte.known in the circles of clerics, students, and merchants, chess entered into the popular culture of the middle ages. an example is the 209th song of carmina burana from the 13th world chess championship in iceland during the cold war.the game of chess, at times, has been discouraged by various religious authorities, including jewish, christian and muslim. jewish scholars maimonides and kalonymus ben kalonymus both condemned chess, though the former only condemned it when played for money while the latter condemned it in all circumstances. in medieval times both the catholic and orthodox churches condemned chess. though the 16th century russian orthodox domostroy condemned the game, chess nevertheless remained popular in russia. in 1979, iranian ayatollah ruhollah khomeini ruled against chess, but later allowed it as long as it did not involve gambling. iran now has an active confederation for playing chess and sends players to international events. saudi mufti abdul-aziz ash-sheikh similarly ruled against chess, arguing that it constituted gambling. iraqi ayatollah ali al-sistani said chess was forbidden ""even without placing a bet3.bh5+ and now:in chess, tactics in general concentrate on short-term actions018, there are 1725 active grandmasters and 3903 international masters in the world. the top three countries with the largest numbers of grandmasters are russia, the united states, and germany, with 251, 98, and 96, respectively. fide also awards titles for arbiters and trainers.international titles are awarded to composers and solvers of chess problems and to correspondence chess players  a beginner or casual player typically has an elo rating of less than 1000; an ordinary club player has a rating of about 1500, a strong club player about 2000, a grandmaster usually has a rating of over 2500, and an elite player has a rating of over 2700. the highest fide rating of all time, 2881, was achieved by magnus carlsen on the march 2014 fide rating list.chess composition is the art of creating chess problems  there are many types of chess problems; the two most important are:chess composition is a distinct branch of chess sport, and tournaments exist for both the composition and solving of chess problems.this is one of the most famous chess studies; it was published by richard r1. it seems impossible to catch the advanced black pawn, while the black king can easily stop the white pawn. the solution is a diagonal advance, which brings the king to both pawns simultaneously:or 2...h3 3.ke7 and the white king can support its pawn.now the white king comes just in time to support his pawn, or catch the black one.if 3...kxc6, 4.kf4 and white will capture the pawn.both sides will queen, resulting in a draw.chess has an extensive literature. in 1913, the chess historian h.j.r. murray estimated the total number of books, magazines, and chess columns in newspapers to be about 5,000. b.h. wood estimated the number, as of 1949, to be about 20,000. david hooper and kenneth whyld write that, ""since then there has been a steady increase year by year of the number of new chess publications. no one knows how many have been printed."" there are two significant public chess libraries: the john g. white chess and checkers collection at cleveland public library, with over 32,000 chess books and over 6,000 bound volumes of chess periodicals; and the chess & draughts collection at the national library of the netherlands, with about 30,000 books. gm lothar schmid owned the worlds largest private collection of chess books and memorabilia. david delucias chess library contains 7,000 to 8,000 chess books, a similar number of autographs  dirk jan ten geuzendam opines that delucias collection ""is arguably the finest chess collection in the world"".the game structure and nature of chess are related to several branches of mathematics. many combinatorical and topological problems connected to chess have been known for hundreds of years.the number of legal positions in chess is estimated to be about 1043, and has been proved to be fewer than 1047, with a game-tree complexity of approximately 10123. the game-tree complexity of chess was first calculated by claude shannon as 10120, a number known as the shannon number. an average position typically has thirty to forty possible moves, but there may be as few as zero chess has inspired many combinatorial puzzles, such as the knights tour and the eight queens puzzle.the idea of creating a chess-playing machine dates to the 18th006.in 2009, a mobile phone won a category 6 tournament with a performance rating 2898: chess engine hiarcs 13 running on the mobile phone htc touch hd won the copa mercosur tournament with nine wins and one draw. the best chess programs are now able to consistently beat the strongest human players, to the extent that human006 world championship.in 1913, ernst zermelo used chess as a basis for his theory of game strategies, which is considered as one of the predecessors of game theory. zermelos theorem states that it is possible to solve chess, i.e. to determine with certainty the outcome of a perfectly played game  according to claude shannon, however, there are 1043 legal positions in chess, so it will take an impossibly long time to compute a perfect strategy with any feasible technology.the 11-category, game theoretical taxonomy of chess includes: two player, no-chance, combinatorial, markov state generalized chess some applications of combinatorial game theory to chess endgames were found by elkies there is an extensive scientific literature on chess psychology. alfred binet and others showed that knowledge and verbal, rather than visuospatial, ability lies at the core of expertise. in his doctoral thesis, adriaan de groot showed that chess masters can rapidly perceive the key features of a position. according to de groot, this perception, made possible by years of practice and study, is more important than the sheer ability to anticipate moves. de groot showed that chess masters can memorize positions shown for a few seconds almost perfectly. the ability to memorize does not alone account for chess-playing skill, since masters and novices, when faced with random arrangements of chess pieces, had equivalent recall more recent research has focused on chess as mental training; the respective roles of knowledge and look-ahead search; brain imaging studies of chess masters and novices; blindfold chess; the role of personality and intelligence in chess skill; gender differences; and computational models of chess expertise. the role of practice and talent in the development of chess and other domains of expertise has led to much recent research. ericsson and colleagues have argued that deliberate practice is sufficient for reaching high levels of expertise in chess. recent research indicates that factors other than practice are also important. for example, fernand gobet and colleagues have shown that stronger players started playing chess at a young age and that experts born in the northern hemisphere are more likely to have been born in late winter and early spring. compared to general population, chess players are more likely to be non-right-handed, though they found no correlation between handedness and skill.a relationship between chess skill and intelligence has long been discussed in the literature and popular culture. academic studies of the relationship date back at least to 1927. academic opinion has long been split on how strong the relationship is, as some studies find no relationship and others find a relatively strong one. a 2016 meta-analysis and review based on 19 studies and a total sample size of 1,779 found that various aspects of general intelligence correlate with chess skill, with average correlations ranging from 0.13  the review did not find strong evidence of publication bias biasing these estimates. moderator analyses indicated that the relationship was stronger in unranked players there are more than two thousand published chess variants, most of them of relatively recent origin, including:prime sources in english describing chess variants and their rules include david pritchards encyclopedias, the website the chess variant pages created by hans bodlaender with various contributors, and the magazine variant chess published from 1990 reference aidslists",1,0
"palliative care  within the published literature, many definitions of palliative care exist; most notably, the world health organization describes palliative care as ""an approach that improves the quality of life of patients and their families facing the problems associated with life-threatening illness, through the prevention and relief of suffering by means of early identification and impeccable assessment and treatment of pain and other problems, physical, psychosocial, and spiritual."" in the past, palliative care was a disease specific approach, but today the world health organization takes a more broad approach, that the principles of palliative care should be applied as early as possible to any chronic and ultimately fatal illness.palliative care is appropriate for individuals with serious illnesses across the age spectrum and can be provided as the main goal of care or in tandem with curative treatment. it is provided by an interdisciplinary team which can include physicians, nurses, occupational and physical therapists, psychologists, social workers, chaplains, and dietitians. palliative care can be provided in a variety of contexts including hospitals, outpatient, skilled-nursing, and home settings. although an important part of end-of-life care, palliative care is not limited to individuals near the end of life.evidence supports the efficacy of a palliative care approach in improvement of a patients quality of life.palliative cares main focus is to improve the quality of life for those with chronic illnesses. it is commonly the case that palliative care is provided at the end of life, but it can be for a patient of any age.the overall goal of palliative care is to improve quality of life of individuals with serious illness, any life-threatening condition which either reduces an individuals daily function or quality of life or increases caregiver burden, through pain and symptom management, identification and support of caregiver needs, and care coordination. palliative care can be delivered at any stage of illness alongside other treatments with curative or life-prolonging intent and is not restricted to people receiving end-of-life care. historically, palliative care services were focused on individuals with incurable cancer, but this framework is now applied to other diseases, like severe heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,  and multiple sclerosis and other neurodegenerative conditions.palliative care can be initiated in a variety of care settings, including emergency rooms, hospitals, hospice facilities, or at home. for some severe disease processes, medical specialty professional organizations recommend initiating palliative care at the time of diagnosis or disease-directed options would not improve a patients trajectory. for example, the american society of clinical oncology recommends that patients with advanced cancer should be ""referred to interdisciplinary palliative care teams that provide inpatient and outpatient care early in the course of disease, alongside active treatment of their cancer"" within eight weeks of diagnosis.appropriately engaging palliative care providers as a part of patient care improves overall symptom control, quality of life, and family satisfaction of care while reducing overall healthcare costs.the distinction between palliative care and hospice differs depending on global context.in the united states, hospice services and palliative care programs share similar goals of mitigating unpleasant symptoms, controlling pain, optimizing comfort, and addressing psychological distress. hospice care focuses on comfort and psychological support and curative therapies are not pursued. under the medicare hospice benefit, individuals certified by two physicians to have less than six months to live over 40% of all dying patients in america currently undergo hospice care. most of the hospice care occurs at a home environment during the last weeks/months of their lives. of those patients, 86.6% believe their care is ""excellent.""  hospices philosophy is that death is a part of life, so it is personal and unique. caregivers are encouraged to discuss death with the patients and encourage spiritual exploration the field of palliative care grew out of the hospice movement, which is commonly associated with dame cicely saunders, who founded st. christophers hospice for the terminally ill in 1967, and elisabeth k006. additionally, in 2011, the joint commission began an advanced certification program for palliative care that recognizes hospital inpatient programs demonstrating outstanding care and enhancement of the quality of life for people with serious illness.one instrument used in palliative care is the edmonton symptom assessment scale  and sometimes shortness of breath. a score of 0 indicates absence of the symptom, and a score of 10 indicates the worst possible severity. the instrument can be completed by the patient, with or without assistance, or by nurses and relatives.medications used in palliative care can be common medications but used for a different indication based on established practices with varying degrees of evidence. examples include the use of antipsychotic medications to treat nausea, anticonvulsants to treat pain, and morphine to treat dyspnea. routes of administration may differ from acute or chronic care, as many people in palliative care lose the ability to swallow. a common alternative route of administration is subcutaneous, as it is less traumatic and less difficult to maintain than intravenous medications. other routes of administration include sublingual, intramuscular and transdermal. medications are often managed at home by family or nursing support.palliative care interventions in care homes may contribute to lower discomfort for residents with dementia and to improve family members views of the quality of care. however, higher quality research is needed to support the benefits of these interventions for older people dying in these facilities.for many patients, end of life care can cause emotional and psychological distress, contributing to their total suffering. an interdisciplinary palliative care team consisting of a mental health professional,  social worker, counselor, as well as spiritual support such as a chaplain, can play important roles in helping people and their families cope using various methods such as counseling, visualization, cognitive methods, drug therapy and relaxation therapy to address their needs. palliative pets can play a role in this last category.total painin the 1960s, hospice pioneer cicely saunders first introduced the term ""total pain"" to describe the heterogenous nature of pain.  this is the idea that a patients experience of total pain has distinctive roots in the physical, psychological, social and spiritual realm but that they are all still closely linked to one another. identifying the cause of pain can help guide care for some patients, and impact their quality of life overall.physical pain can be managed using pain medications as long as they do not put the patient at further risk for developing or increasing medical diagnoses such as heart problems or difficulty breathing. patients at the end of life can exhibit many physical symptoms that can cause extreme pain such as dyspnea radiation is commonly used with palliative intent to alleviate pain in patients with cancer. as an effect from radiation may take days to weeks to occur, patients dying a short time following their treatment are unlikely to receive benefit.once the immediate physical pain has been dealt with, it is important to remember to be a compassionate and empathetic caregiver that is there to listen and be there for their patients. being able to identify the distressing factors in their life other than the pain can help them be more comfortable. when a patient has their needs met then they are more likely to be open to the idea of hospice or treatments outside of comfort care. having a psychosocial assessment allows the medical team to help facilitate a healthy patient-family understanding of adjustment, coping and support. this communication between the medical team and the patients and family can also help facilitate discussions on the process of maintaining and enhancing relationships, finding meaning in the dying process, and achieving a sense of control while confronting and preparing for death.spirituality is a fundamental component of palliative care. according to the clinical practice guidelines for quality palliative care, spirituality is a ""dynamic and intrinsic aspect of humanity..."" and has been associated with ""an improved quality of life for those with chronic and serious illness..."" . spiritual beliefs and practices can influence perceptions of pain and distress, as well as quality of life among advanced cancer patients.pediatric palliative care is family-centered, specialized medical care for children with serious illnesses that focuses on mitigating the physical, emotional, psychosocial, and spiritual suffering associated with illness to ultimately optimize quality of life.pediatric palliative care practitioners receive specialized training in family-centered, developmental and age-appropriate skills in communication and facilitation of shared decision making; assessment and management of pain and distressing symptoms; advanced knowledge in care coordination of multidisciplinary pediatric caregiving medical teams; referral to hospital and ambulatory resources available to patients and families; and psychologically supporting children and families through illness and bereavement.as with palliative care for adults, symptom assessment and management is a critical component of pediatric palliative care as it improves quality of life, gives children and families a sense of control, and prolongs life in some cases. the general approach to assessment and management of distressing symptoms in children by a palliative care team is as follows:the most common symptoms in children with severe chronic disease appropriate for palliative care consultation are weakness, fatigue, pain, poor appetite, weight loss, agitation, lack of mobility, shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting, constipation, sadness or depression, drowsiness, difficulty with speech, headache, excess secretions, anemia, pressure area problems, anxiety, fever, and mouth sores. the most common end of life symptoms in children include shortness of breath, cough, fatigue, pain, nausea and vomiting, agitation and anxiety, poor concentration, skin lesions, swelling of the extremities, seizures, poor appetite, difficulty with feeding, and diarrhea. in older children with neurologic and neuromuscular manifestations of disease, there is a high burden of anxiety and depression that correlates with disease progression, increasing disability, and greater dependence on carers. from the caregivers perspective, families find changes in behavior, reported pain, lack of appetite, changes in appearance, talking to god or angels, breathing changes, weakness, and fatigue to be the most distressing symptoms to witness in their loved ones.as discussed above, within the field of adult palliative medicine, validated symptoms assessment tools are frequently utilized by providers, but these tools lack essential aspects of childrens symptom experience. within pediatrics, there is not a comprehensive symptoms assessment widely employed. a few symptoms assessment tools trialed among older children receiving palliative care include the symptom distress scale, and the memorial symptom assessment scale, and childhood cancer stressors inventor. quality of life considerations within pediatrics are unique and an important component of symptoms assessment. the pediatric cancer quality of life inventory-32  symptom assessment tools for younger age groups are rarely utilized as they have limited value, especially for infants and young children who are not at a developmental stage where they can articulate symptoms.within the realm of pediatric medical care, the palliative care team is tasked with facilitating family-centered communication with children and their families, as well as multidisciplinary pediatric caregiving medical teams to forward coordinated medical management and the childs quality of life. strategies for communication are complex as the pediatric palliative care practitioners must facilitate a shared understanding of and consensus for goals of care and therapies available to the sick child amongst multiple medical teams who often have different areas of expertise. additionally, pediatric palliative care practitioners must assess both the sick child and their familys understanding of complex illness and options for care, and provide accessible, thoughtful education to address knowledge gaps and allow for informed decision making. finally, practitioners are supporting children and families in the queries, emotional distress, and decision making that ensues from the childs illness.many frameworks for communication have been established within the medical literature, but the field of pediatric palliative care is still in relative infancy. communication considerations and strategies employed in a palliative setting include:funding for hospice and palliative care services varies. in great britain and many other countries all palliative care is offered free, either through the national health service or through charities working in partnership with the local health services. palliative care services in the united states are paid by philanthropy, fee-for-service mechanisms, or from direct hospital support while hospice care is provided as a medicare benefit; similar hospice benefits are offered by medicaid and most private health insurers. under the medicare hospice benefit in most countries, hospice care and palliative care is provided by an interdisciplinary team consisting of physicians, pharmacists, nurses, nursing assistants, social workers, chaplains, and caregivers. in some countries, additional members of the team may include certified nursing assistants and home healthcare aides, as well as volunteers from the community  to provide expertise in the care of people with life-limiting, advanced disease, and catastrophic injury; the relief of distressing symptoms; the coordination of interdisciplinary care in diverse settings; the use of specialized care systems including hospice; the management of the imminently dying patient; and legal and ethical decision making in end of life care.caregivers, both family and volunteers, are crucial to the palliative care system. caregivers and people being treated often form lasting friendships over the course of care. as a consequence caregivers may find themselves under severe emotional and physical strain. opportunities for caregiver respite are some of the services hospices provide to promote caregiver well-being. respite may last a few hours up to several days in the us, board certification for physicians in palliative care was through the american board of hospice and palliative medicine; recently this was changed to be done through any of 11 different speciality boards through an american board of medical specialties-approved procedure. additionally, board certification is available to osteopathic physicians  more than 50 fellowship programs provide one to two years of specialty training following a primary residency. in britain palliative care has been a full specialty of medicine since 1989 and training is governed by the same regulations through the royal college of physicians as with any other medical speciality. nurses, in the united states and internationally, can receive continuing education credits through palliative care specific trainings, such as those offered by end of life nursing education consortium in india tata memorial centre, mumbai has started a physician course in palliative medicine for the first time in the country since 2012.in the united states, hospice and palliative care represent two different aspects of care with similar philosophy, but with different payment systems and location of services. palliative care services are most often provided in acute care hospitals organized around an interdisciplinary consultation service, with or without an acute inpatient palliative care unit. palliative care may also be provided in the dying persons home as a ""bridge"" program between traditional us home care services and hospice care or provided in long-term care facilities. in contrast over 80% of hospice care in the us is provided at home with the remainder provided to people in long-term care facilities or in free standing hospice residential facilities. in the uk hospice is seen as one part of the speciality of palliative care and no differentiation is made between hospice and palliative care.in the uk palliative care services offer inpatient care, home care, day care and outpatient services, and work in close partnership with mainstream services. hospices often house a full range of services and professionals for children and adults. in 2015 the uks palliative care was ranked as the best in the world ""due to comprehensive national policies, the extensive integration of palliative care into the national health service, a strong hospice movement, and deep community engagement on the issue.""the focus on a persons quality of life has increased greatly since the 1990s. in the united states today, 55% of hospitals with more than 100 beds offer a palliative-care program, and nearly one-fifth of community hospitals have palliative-care programs. a relatively recent development is the palliative-care team, a dedicated health care team that is entirely geared toward palliative treatment.physicians practicing palliative care do not always receive support from the people they are treating, family members, healthcare professionals or their social peers. more than half of physicians in one survey reported that they have had at least one experience where a patients family members, another physician or another health care professional had characterized their work as being ""euthanasia, murder or killing"" during the last five years. a quarter of them had received similar comments from their own friends or family member, or from a patient.despite significant progress that has been made to increase the access to palliative care within the united states and other countries as well, many countries have not yet considered palliative care as a public health problem and therefore, do not include it in their public health agenda. resources and cultural attitudes both play significant roles in the acceptance and implementation of palliative care in the health care agenda.the official publication of the college of family physicians of canada provides an article on the stigma around palliative patient care. in this article, it states that many patients with chronic pain are treated as opioid addicts. patients can build a tolerance to drugs and have to take more and more to manage their pain. the symptoms of chronic pain patients do not show up on scans, so the doctor must go off trust alone. this is the reason that some wait to consult their doctor and endure sometimes years of pain before seeking help.palliative care was the subject of the 2018 academy award-nominated netflix short documentary, end game by directors rob epstein and jeffrey friedman about terminally ill patients in a san francisco hospital and features the work of palliative care physician, bj miller. the film was executive produced by steven ungerleider, david c. ulich and shoshana r. ungerleider.",1,0
"coronaviruses are a group of related rna viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds. in humans and birds, they cause respiratory tract infections that can range from mild to lethal. mild illnesses in humans include some cases of the common cold  they are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense single-stranded rna genome and a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry. the genome size of coronaviruses ranges from approximately 26 to 32 kilobases, one of the largest among rna viruses. they have characteristic club-shaped spikes that project from their surface, which in electron micrographs create an image reminiscent of the solar corona, from which their name derives.the name ""coronavirus"" is derived from latin corona, meaning ""crown"" or ""wreath"", itself a borrowing from greek 009. the common name coronavirus is used to refer to any member of the subfamily orthocoronavirinae. as of 2020, 45 species are officially recognised.the earliest reports of a coronavirus infection in animals occurred in the late 1920s, when an acute respiratory infection of domesticated chickens emerged in north america. arthur schalk and m.c. hawn in 1931 made the first detailed report which described a new respiratory infection of chickens in north dakota. the infection of new-born chicks was characterized by gasping and listlessness with high mortality rates of 40. they isolated and grew the virus in kidney tissue culture, assigning it as 229e. the novel virus caused a cold in volunteers and was inactivated by ether similarly as b814.scottish virologist june almeida at st. thomas hospital in london, collaborating with tyrrell, compared the structures of ibv, b814 and 229e in 1967. using electron microscopy the three viruses were shown to be morphologically related by their general shape and distinctive club-like spikes. a research group at the national institute of health the same year was able to isolate another member of this new group of viruses using organ culture and named one of the samples oc43  like b814, 229e, and ibv, the novel cold virus oc43 had distinctive club-like spikes when observed with the electron microscope.the ibv-like novel cold viruses were soon shown to be also morphologically related to the mouse hepatitis virus. this new group of viruses were named coronaviruses after their distinctive morphological appearance. human coronavirus 229e and human coronavirus oc43 continued to be studied in subsequent decades. the coronavirus strain b814 was lost. it is not known which present human coronavirus it was. other human coronaviruses have since been identified, including sars-cov in 2003, hcov nl63 in 2003, hcov hku1 in 2004, mers-cov in 2013, and sars-cov-2 in 2020. there have also been a large number of animal coronaviruses identified since the 1960s.coronaviruses are large, roughly spherical particles with unique surface projections. their size is highly variable and generally is an average diameter of 120 nm. extreme sizes are known from 50 to 2000:300.  the e and m protein are the structural proteins that combined with the lipid bilayer shape the viral envelope and maintain its size. s proteins are needed for interaction with the host cells. but human coronavirus nl63 is peculiar in that its m protein has the binding site for the host cell, and not its s protein. the diameter of the envelope is 8518 to 263 amino acid residues and forms a layer of 7.80 e proteins in a coronavirus. they are 8.4 to 12 kda in size and are composed of 76 to 109 amino acids. they are integral proteins the spikes are the most distinguishing feature of coronaviruses, and are responsible for the corona- or halo-like surface. on average a coronavirus particle has 74 surface spikes. each spike is about 20 subunit. the homotrimeric s subunits. the subunit complex is split to individual subunits when the virus binds and fuses with the host cell under the action of proteases such as cathepsin family and transmembrane protease serine 2 s1 proteins are the most critical components in terms of infection. they are also the most variable components as they are responsible for host cell specificity. they possess two major domains named n-terminal domain a subset of coronaviruses  the he proteins occur as homodimers composed of about 400 amino acid residues and are 40 to 50 kda in size. they appear as tiny surface projections of 5 to 7, which are typically rich in arginines and lysines. domain 3 has a short carboxy terminal end and has a net negative charge due to excess of acidic over basic amino acid residues.coronaviruses contain a positive-sense, single-stranded rna genome. the genome size for coronaviruses ranges from 26.4 to 31.7 kilobases. the genome size is one of the largest among rna viruses. the genome has a 5 methylated cap and a 3 polyadenylated tail.the genome organization for a coronavirus is 5-leader-utr-replicase the later reading frames encode the four major structural proteins: spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid. interspersed between these reading frames are the reading frames for the accessory proteins. the number of accessory proteins and their function is unique depending on the specific coronavirus.infection begins when the viral spike protein attaches to its complementary host cell receptor. after attachment, a protease of the host cell cleaves and activates the receptor-attached spike protein. depending on the host cell protease available, cleavage and activation allows the virus to enter the host cell by endocytosis or direct fusion of the viral envelope with the host membrane.on entry into the host cell, the virus particle is uncoated, and its genome enters the cell cytoplasm. the coronavirus rna genome has a 5 methylated cap and a 3 polyadenylated tail, which allows it to act like a messenger rna and be directly translated by the host cells ribosomes. the host ribosomes translate the initial overlapping open reading frames orf1a and orf1b of the virus genome into two large overlapping polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab.the larger polyprotein pp1ab is a result of a -1 ribosomal frameshift caused by a slippery sequence  the ribosomal frameshift allows for the continuous translation of orf1a followed by orf1b.the polyproteins have their own proteases,  plpro a number of the nonstructural proteins coalesce to form a multi-protein replicase-transcriptase complex. the main replicase-transcriptase protein is the rna-dependent rna polymerase replication   transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus  the pig epithelial cells of the digestive tract by binding to the alanine aminopeptidase coronaviruses form the subfamily orthocoronavirinae, which is one of two sub-families in the family coronaviridae, order nidovirales, and realm riboviria. they are divided into the four genera: alphacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus. alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses infect mammals, while gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses primarily infect birds.the most recent common ancestor  the most recent common ancestor of the alphacoronavirus line has been placed at about 2400 bce, of the betacoronavirus line at 3300 bce, of the gammacoronavirus line at 2800 bce, and of the deltacoronavirus line at about 3000 bce. bats and birds, as warm-blooded flying vertebrates, are an ideal natural reservoir for the coronavirus gene pool many human coronaviruses have their origin in bats. the human coronavirus nl63 shared a common ancestor with a bat coronavirus  the human coronavirus 229e shared a common ancestor with a bat coronavirus  more recently, alpaca coronavirus and human coronavirus 229e diverged sometime before 1960. mers-cov emerged in humans from bats through the intermediate host of camels. mers-cov, although related to several bat coronavirus species, appears to have diverged from these several centuries ago. the most closely related bat coronavirus and sars-cov diverged in 1986. a possible path of evolution of sars coronavirus and keen bat coronaviruses is that sars-related coronaviruses coevolved in bats for a long time. the ancestors of sars-cov first infected leaf-nose bats of the genus hipposideridae; subsequently, they spread to horseshoe bats in the species rhinolophidae, then to asian palm civets, and finally to humans.unlike other betacoronaviruses, bovine coronavirus of the species betacoronavirus 1 and subgenus embecovirus is thought to have originated in rodents and not in bats. in the 1790s, equine coronavirus diverged from the bovine coronavirus after a cross-species jump. later in the 1890s, human coronavirus oc43 diverged from bovine coronavirus after another cross-species spillover event. it is speculated that the flu pandemic of 1890 may have been caused by this spillover event, and not by the influenza virus, because of the related timing, neurological symptoms, and unknown causative agent of the pandemic. besides causing respiratory infections, human coronavirus oc43 is also suspected of playing a role in neurological diseases. in the 1950s, the human coronavirus oc43 began to diverge into its present genotypes. phylogentically, mouse hepatitis virus  is related to human coronavirus oc43 and bovine coronavirus. human coronavirus hku1, like the aforementioned viruses, also has its origins in rodents.coronaviruses vary significantly in risk factor. some can kill more than 30% of those infected, such as mers-cov, and some are relatively harmless, such as the common cold. coronaviruses can cause colds with major symptoms, such as fever, and a sore throat from swollen adenoids. coronaviruses can cause pneumonia  the human coronavirus discovered in 2003, sars-cov, which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome six species of human coronaviruses are known, with one species subdivided into two different strains, making seven strains of human coronaviruses altogether.four human coronaviruses produce symptoms that are generally mild:three human coronaviruses produce symptoms that are potentially severe:the human coronaviruses hcov-oc43, hcov-hku1, hcov-229e, and hcov-nl63 continually circulate in the human population and produce the generally mild symptoms of the common cold in adults and children worldwide. these coronaviruses cause about 15% of common colds, while 40 to 50% of colds are caused by rhinoviruses.  the four mild coronaviruses have a seasonal incidence occurring in the winter months in temperate climates.  there is no preponderance in any season in tropical climates.in 2003, following the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in september 2012, a new type of coronavirus was identified, initially called novel coronavirus 2012, and now officially named middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus  the world health organization issued a global alert soon after. the who update on 28 september 2012 said the virus did not seem to pass easily from person to person. however, on 12 may 2013, a case of human-to-human transmission in france was confirmed by the french ministry of social affairs and health. in addition, cases of human-to-human transmission were reported by the ministry of health in tunisia. two confirmed cases involved people who seemed to have caught the disease from their late father, who became ill after a visit to qatar and saudi arabia. despite this, it appears the virus had trouble spreading from human to human, as most individuals who are infected do not transmit the virus. by 30 october 2013, there were 124 cases and 52 deaths in saudi arabia.after the dutch erasmus medical centre sequenced the virus, the virus was given a new name, human coronavirus015, an outbreak of mers-cov occurred in the republic of korea, when a man who had traveled to the middle east, visited four hospitals in the seoul area to treat his illness. this caused one of the largest outbreaks of mers-cov outside the middle east. as of december 2019, 2,468 cases of mers-cov infection had been confirmed by laboratory tests, 851 of which were fatal, a mortality rate of approximately 34.5%.in december 2019, a pneumonia outbreak was reported in wuhan, china. on 31 december 2019, the outbreak was traced to a novel strain of coronavirus, which was given the interim name 2019-ncov by the world health organization  later renamed sars-cov-2 by the international committee on taxonomy of viruses.as of 21 december 2020, there have been at least 1,692,151 confirmed deaths and more than 76,760,893 confirmed cases in the covid-19 pandemic. the wuhan strain has been identified as a new strain of betacoronavirus from group 2b with approximately 70% genetic similarity to the sars-cov. the virus has a 96% similarity to a bat coronavirus, so it is widely suspected to originate from bats as well. the pandemic has resulted in travel restrictions and nationwide lockdowns in many countries.coronaviruses have been recognized as causing pathological conditions in veterinary medicine since the 1930s.  they infect a range of animals including swine, cattle, horses, camels, cats, dogs, rodents, birds and bats.  the majority of animal related coronaviruses infect the intestinal tract and are transmitted by a fecal-oral route. significant research efforts have been focused on elucidating the viral pathogenesis of these animal coronaviruses, especially by virologists interested in veterinary and zoonotic diseases.coronaviruses infect domesticated birds. infectious bronchitis virus  the virus is of concern to the poultry industry because of the high mortality from infection, its rapid spread, and its effect on production. the virus affects both meat production and egg production and causes substantial economic loss. in chickens, infectious bronchitis virus targets not only the respiratory tract but also the urogenital tract. the virus can spread to different organs throughout the chicken. the virus is transmitted by aerosol and food contaminated by feces. different vaccines against ibv exist and have helped to limit the spread of the virus and its variants. infectious bronchitis virus is one of a number of strains of the species avian coronavirus. another strain of avian coronavirus is turkey coronavirus coronaviruses also affect other branches of animal husbandry such as pig farming and the cattle raising. swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus  porcine epidemic diarrhea virus  transmissible gastroenteritis virus  is another coronavirus that causes diarrhea in young pigs. in the cattle industry bovine coronavirus  is responsible for severe profuse enteritis in young calves.coronaviruses infect domestic pets such as cats, dogs, and ferrets. there are two forms of feline coronavirus which are both members of the species alphacoronavirus 1. feline enteric coronavirus is a pathogen of minor clinical significance, but spontaneous mutation of this virus can result in feline infectious peritonitis  there are two different coronaviruses that infect dogs. canine coronavirus  causes mild gastrointestinal disease. canine respiratory coronavirus  cause respiratory disease. similarly, there are two types of coronavirus that infect ferrets. ferret enteric coronavirus causes a gastrointestinal syndrome known as epizootic catarrhal enteritis coronaviruses infect laboratory animals. mouse hepatitis virus  causes an epidemic murine illness with high mortality, especially among colonies of laboratory mice.  prior to the discovery of sars-cov, mhv was the best-studied coronavirus both in vivo and in vitro as well as at the molecular level.  some strains of mhv cause a progressive demyelinating encephalitis in mice which has been used as a murine model for multiple sclerosis. sialodacryoadenitis virus  is highly infectious coronavirus of laboratory rats, which can be transmitted between individuals by direct contact and indirectly by aerosol.  rabbit enteric coronavirus causes acute gastrointestinal disease and diarrhea in young european rabbits.  mortality rates are high.a number of vaccines using different methods have been developed against human coronavirus sars-cov-2. antiviral targets against human coronaviruses have also been identified such as viral proteases, polymerases, and entry proteins. drugs are in development which target these proteins and the different steps of viral replication.vaccines are available for animal coronaviruses ibv, tgev, and canine cov, although their effectiveness is limited. in the case of outbreaks of highly contagious animal coronaviruses, such as pedv, measures such as destruction of entire herds of pigs may be used to prevent transmission to other herds.",1,0
"anorexia nervosa, often referred to simply as anorexia, is an eating disorder, characterized by low weight, food restriction, fear of gaining weight and a strong desire to be thin. many people with anorexia see themselves as overweight even though they are, in fact, underweight. they often deny that they have a problem with low weight. they weigh themselves frequently, eat small amounts and only eat certain foods. some exercise excessively, force themselves to vomit, or use laxatives to lose weight. complications may include osteoporosis, infertility and heart damage, among others. women will often stop having menstrual periods. in extreme cases, people with anorexia who continually refuse significant dietary intake and weight restoration interventions, and are declared incompetent to make decisions by a psychiatrist, may be fed by force under restraint via nasogastric tube after asking their parents or proxies to make the decision for them.the cause is currently unknown. there appear to be some genetic components with identical twins more often affected than fraternal twins. cultural factors also appear to play a role, with societies that value thinness having higher rates of disease. additionally, it occurs more commonly among those involved in activities that value thinness, such as high-level athletics, modeling and dancing. anorexia often begins following a major life-change or stress-inducing event. the diagnosis requires a significantly low weight. the severity of disease is based on body mass index  in children a bmi for age percentile of less than the 5th percentile is often used.treatment of anorexia involves restoring a healthy weight, treating the underlying psychological problems and addressing behaviors that promote the problem. while medications do not help with weight gain, they may be used to help with associated anxiety or depression. different therapy methods may be useful, such as cognitive behavioral therapy or an approach where parents assume responsibility for feeding their child known as maudsley family therapy. sometimes people require admission to a hospital to restore weight. evidence for benefit from nasogastric tube feeding, however is unclear; such an intervention may be highly distressing for both anorexia patients and healthcare staff when administered against the patients will under restraint. some people with anorexia will just have a single episode and recover while others may have recurring episodes over years. many complications improve or resolve with regaining of weight.globally, anorexia is estimated to affect 2.9015. it is estimated to occur in 0.9% to 4.3% of women and 0.2% to 0.3% of men in western countries at some point in their life. about 0.4% of young women are affected in a given year and it is estimated to occur ten times more commonly among women than men. rates in most of the developing world are unclear. often it begins during the teen years or young adulthood. while anorexia became more commonly diagnosed during the 20th century it is unclear if this was due to an increase in its frequency or simply better diagnosis. in 2013 it directly resulted in about 600 deaths globally, up from 400 deaths in 1990. eating disorders also increase a persons risk of death from a wide range of other causes, including suicide. about 5% of people with anorexia die from complications over a ten-year period, a nearly six times increased risk. the term ""anorexia nervosa"" was first used in 1873 by william gull to describe this condition.anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder characterized by attempts to lose weight, to the point of starvation. a person with anorexia nervosa may exhibit a number of signs and symptoms, the type and severity of which may vary and may be present but not readily apparent.anorexia nervosa, and the associated malnutrition that results from self-imposed starvation, can cause complications in every major organ system in the body. hypokalaemia, a drop in the level of potassium in the blood, is a sign of anorexia nervosa. a significant drop in potassium can cause abnormal heart rhythms, constipation, fatigue, muscle damage and paralysis.symptoms may include:interoception involves the conscious and unconscious sense of the internal state of the body, and it has an important role in homeostasis and regulation of emotions. aside from noticeable physiological dysfunction, interoceptive deficits also prompt individuals with anorexia to concentrate on distorted perceptions of multiple elements of their body image. this exists in both people with anorexia and in healthy individuals due to impairment in interoceptive sensitivity and interoceptive awareness.aside from weight gain and outer appearance, people with anorexia also report abnormal bodily functions such as indistinct feelings of fullness. this provides an example of miscommunication between internal signals of the body and the brain. due to impaired interoceptive sensitivity, powerful cues of fullness may be detected prematurely in highly sensitive individuals, which can result in decreased calorie consumption and generate anxiety surrounding food intake in anorexia patients. people with anorexia also report difficulty identifying and describing their emotional feelings and the inability to distinguish emotions from bodily sensations in general, called alexithymia.interoceptive awareness and emotion are deeply intertwined, and could mutually impact each other in abnormalities. anorexia patients also exhibit emotional regulation difficulties that ignite emotionally-cued eating behaviors, such as restricting food or excessive exercising. impaired interoceptive sensitivity and interoceptive awareness can lead anorexia patients to adapt distorted interpretations of weight gain that are cued by physical sensations related to digestion  combined, these interoceptive and emotional elements could together trigger maladaptive and negatively reinforced behavioral responses that assist in the maintenance of anorexia. in addition to metacognition, people with anorexia also have difficulty with social cognition including interpreting others8 and 58%. first-degree relatives of those with anorexia have roughly 12 times the risk of developing anorexia. association studies have been performed, studying 128 different polymorphisms related to 43 genes including genes involved in regulation of eating behavior, motivation and reward mechanics, personality traits and emotion. consistent associations have been identified for polymorphisms associated with agouti-related peptide, brain derived neurotrophic factor, catechol-o-methyl transferase, sk3 and opioid receptor delta-1. epigenetic modifications, such as dna methylation, may contribute to the development or maintenance of anorexia nervosa, though clinical research in this area is in its infancy.a 2019 study found a genetic relationship with mental disorders, such as schizophrenia, obsessive diabetes and leptin.obstetric complications: prenatal and perinatal complications may factor into the development of anorexia nervosa, such as preterm birth, maternal anemia, diabetes mellitus, preeclampsia, placental infarction, and neonatal heart abnormalities. neonatal complications may also have an influence on harm avoidance, one of the personality traits associated with the development of an.neuroendocrine dysregulation: altered signalling of peptides that facilitate communication between the gut, brain and adipose tissue, such as ghrelin, leptin, neuropeptide y and orexin, may contribute to the pathogenesis of anorexia nervosa by disrupting regulation of hunger and satiety.gastrointestinal diseases: people with gastrointestinal disorders may be more at risk of developing disorders of eating practices than the general population, principally restrictive eating disturbances. an association of anorexia nervosa with celiac disease has been found. the role that gastrointestinal symptoms play in the development of eating disorders seems rather complex. some authors report that unresolved symptoms prior to gastrointestinal disease diagnosis may create a food aversion in these persons, causing alterations to their eating patterns. other authors report that greater symptoms throughout their diagnosis led to greater risk. it has been documented that some people with celiac disease, irritable bowel syndrome or inflammatory bowel disease who are not conscious about the importance of strictly following their diet, choose to consume their trigger foods to promote weight loss. on the other hand, individuals with good dietary management may develop anxiety, food aversion and eating disorders because of concerns around cross contamination of their foods. some authors suggest that medical professionals should evaluate the presence of an unrecognized celiac disease in all people with eating disorder, especially if they present any gastrointestinal symptom  especially in women.studies have hypothesized the continuance of disordered eating patterns may be epiphenomena of starvation. the results of the minnesota starvation experiment showed normal controls exhibit many of the behavioral patterns of an when subjected to starvation. this may be due to the numerous changes in the neuroendocrine system, which results in a self-perpetuating cycle.anorexia nervosa is more likely to occur in a persons pubertal years. some explanatory hypotheses for the rising prevalence of eating disorders in adolescence are ""increase of adipose tissue in girls, hormonal changes of puberty, societal expectations of increased independence and autonomy that are particularly difficult for anorexic adolescents to meet;  increased influence of the peer group and its values.""early theories of the cause of anorexia linked it to childhood sexual abuse or dysfunctional families; evidence is conflicting, and well-designed research is needed. the fear of food is known as sitiophobia, cibophobia, and is part of the differential diagnosis. other psychological causes of anorexia include low self-esteem, feeling like there is lack of control, depression, anxiety, and loneliness.some anorexic people might be perfectionists or have an obsessive compulsive personality which makes them stick to a restricted diet.anorexia nervosa has been increasingly diagnosed since 1950; the increase has been linked to vulnerability and internalization of body ideals. people in professions where there is a particular social pressure to be thin  and those with anorexia have much higher contact with cultural sources that promote weight loss. this trend can also be observed for people who partake in certain sports, such as jockeys and wrestlers. there is a higher incidence and prevalence of anorexia nervosa in sports with an emphasis on aesthetics, where low body fat is advantageous, and sports in which one has to make weight for competition. family group dynamics can play a role in the cause of anorexia including negative expressed emotion in overprotective families where blame is frequently experienced among its members. when there is a constant pressure from people to be thin, teasing and bullying can cause low self-esteem and other psychological symptoms.persistent exposure to media that presents body ideals may constitute a risk factor for body dissatisfaction and anorexia nervosa. the cultural ideal for body shape for men versus women continues to favor slender women and athletic, v-shaped muscular men. a 2002 review found that, of the magazines most popular among people aged 18 to 24 years, those read by men, unlike those read by women, were more likely to feature ads and articles on shape than on diet. body dissatisfaction and internalization of body ideals are risk factors for anorexia nervosa that threaten the health of both male and female populations.websites that stress the importance of attainment of body ideals extol and promote anorexia nervosa through the use of religious metaphors, lifestyle descriptions, ""thinspiration"" or ""fitspiration""  pro-anorexia websites reinforce internalization of body ideals and the importance of their attainment.the media portray a false view of what people truly look like. in magazines and movies and even on billboards most of the actors/models are digitally altered in multiple ways. people then strive to look like these ""perfect"" role models when in reality they are not near perfection themselves.evidence from physiological, pharmacological and neuroimaging studies suggest serotonin  these alterations in serotonin have been linked to traits characteristic of anorexia such as obsessiveness, anxiety, and appetite dysregulation.neuroimaging studies investigating the functional connectivity between brain regions have observed a number of alterations in networks related to cognitive control, introspection, and sensory function. alterations in networks related to the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex may be related to excessive cognitive control of eating related behaviors. similarly, altered somatosensory integration and introspection may relate to abnormal body image. a review of functional neuroimaging studies reported reduced activations in ""bottom up"" limbic region and increased activations in ""top down"" cortical regions which may play a role in restrictive eating.compared to controls, recovered anorexics show reduced activation in the reward system in response to food, and reduced correlation between self reported liking of a sugary drink and activity in the striatum and anterior cingulate cortex. increased binding potential of 11c radiolabelled raclopride in the striatum, interpreted as reflecting decreased endogenous dopamine due to competitive displacement, has also been observed.structural neuroimaging studies have found global reductions in both gray matter and white matter, as well as increased cerebrospinal fluid volumes. regional decreases in the left hypothalamus, left inferior parietal lobe, right lentiform nucleus and right caudate have also been reported in acutely ill patients. however, these alterations seem to be associated with acute malnutrition and largely reversible with weight restoration, at least in nonchronic cases in younger people. in contrast, some studies have reported increased orbitofrontal cortex volume in currently ill and times greater than in the general population, and the suicide risk is 56 times higher. half of women with an achieve a full recovery, while an additional 200% develop anorexia nervosa as a chronic disorder. if anorexia nervosa is not treated, serious complications such as heart conditions and kidney failure can arise and eventually lead to death.  the average number of years from onset to remission of an is seven for women and three for men. after ten to fifteen years, 70% of people no longer meet the diagnostic criteria, but many still continue to have eating-related problems.alexithymia influences treatment outcome. recovery is also viewed on a spectrum rather than black and white. according to the morgan-russell criteria, individuals can have a good, intermediate, or poor outcome. even when a person is classified as having a ""good"" outcome, weight only has to be within 15% of average, and normal menstruation must be present in females. the good outcome also excludes psychological health. recovery for people with anorexia nervosa is undeniably positive, but recovery does not mean a return to normal.anorexia nervosa can have serious implications if its duration and severity are significant and if onset occurs before the completion of growth, pubertal maturation, or the attainment of peak bone mass. complications specific to adolescents and children with anorexia nervosa can include the following:growth retardation may occur, as height gain may slow and can stop completely with severe weight loss or chronic malnutrition. in such cases, provided that growth potential is preserved, height increase can resume and reach full potential after normal intake is resumed. height potential is normally preserved if the duration and severity of illness are not significant or if the illness is accompanied by delayed bone age  appropriate early treatment can preserve height potential, and may even help to increase it in some post-anorexic subjects, due to factors such as long-term reduced estrogen-producing adipose tissue levels compared to premorbid levels. in some cases, especially where onset is before puberty, complications such as stunted growth and pubertal delay are usually reversible.anorexia nervosa causes alterations in the female reproductive system; significant weight loss, as well as psychological stress and intense exercise, typically results in a cessation of menstruation in women who are past puberty. in patients with anorexia nervosa, there is a reduction of the secretion of gonadotropin releasing hormone in the central nervous system, preventing ovulation. anorexia nervosa can also result in pubertal delay or arrest. both height gain and pubertal development are dependent on the release of growth hormone and gonadotropins  typically, growth hormone  igf-1 is necessary for bone formation, and decreased levels in anorexia nervosa contribute to a loss of bone density and potentially contribute to osteopenia or osteoporosis. anorexia nervosa can also result in reduction of peak bone mass. buildup of bone is greatest during adolescence, and if onset of anorexia nervosa occurs during this time and stalls puberty, low bone mass may be permanent.hepatic steatosis, or fatty infiltration of the liver, can also occur, and is an indicator of malnutrition in children. neurological disorders that may occur as complications include seizures and tremors. wernicke encephalopathy, which results from vitamin b1 deficiency, has been reported in patients who are extremely malnourished; symptoms include confusion, problems with the muscles responsible for eye movements and abnormalities in walking gait.the most common gastrointestinal complications of anorexia nervosa are delayed stomach emptying and constipation, but also include elevated liver function tests, diarrhea, acute pancreatitis, heartburn, difficulty swallowing, and, rarely, superior mesenteric artery syndrome. delayed stomach emptying, or gastroparesis, often develops following food restriction and weight loss; the most common symptom is bloating with gas and abdominal distension, and often occurs after eating. other symptoms of gastroparesis include early satiety, fullness, nausea, and vomiting. the symptoms may inhibit efforts at eating and recovery, but can be managed by limiting high-fiber foods, using liquid nutritional supplements, or using metoclopramide to increase emptying of food from the stomach. gastroparesis generally resolves when weight is regained.anorexia nervosa increases the risk of sudden cardiac death, though the precise cause is unknown. cardiac complications include structural and functional changes to the heart. some of these cardiovascular changes are mild and are reversible with treatment, while others may be life-threatening. cardiac complications can include arrhythmias, abnormally slow heart beat, low blood pressure, decreased size of the heart muscle, reduced heart volume, mitral valve prolapse, myocardial fibrosis, and pericardial effusion.abnormalities in conduction and repolarization of the heart that can result from anorexia nervosa include qt prolongation, increased qt dispersion, conduction delays,  and junctional escape rhythms. electrolyte abnormalities, particularly hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, can cause anomalies in the electrical activity of the heart, and result in life-threatening arrhythmias. hypokalemia most commonly results in anorexic patients when restricting is accompanied by purging  orthostasis in anorexia nervosa indicates worsening cardiac function and may indicate a need for hospitalization.  hypotension and orthostasis generally resolve upon recovery to a normal weight. the weight loss in anorexia nervosa also causes atrophy of cardiac muscle. this leads to decreased ability to pump blood, a reduction in the ability to sustain exercise, a diminished ability to increase blood pressure in response to exercise, and a subjective feeling of fatigue.some individuals may also have a decrease in cardiac contractility. cardiac complications can be life-threatening, but the heart muscle generally improves with weight gain, and the heart normalizes in size over weeks to months, with recovery. atrophy of the heart muscle is a marker of the severity of the disease, and while it is reversible with treatment and refeeding, it is possible that it may cause permanent, microscopic changes to the heart muscle that increase the risk of sudden cardiac death. individuals with anorexia nervosa may experience chest pain or palpitations; these can be a result of mitral valve prolapse. mitral valve prolapse occurs because the size of the heart muscle decreases while the tissue of the mitral valve remains the same size. studies have shown rates of mitral valve prolapse of around 20 percent in those with anorexia nervosa, while the rate in the general population is estimated at 2% with many studies reporting a relapse rate of at least 25%. relapse occurs in approximately a third of people in hospital, and is greatest in the first six to eighteen months after release from an institution.anorexia is estimated to occur in 0.9% to 4.3% of women and 0.2% to 0.3% of men in western countries at some point in their life. about 0.4% of young females are affected in a given year and it is estimated to occur three to ten times less commonly in males. rates in most of the developing world are unclear. often it begins during the teen years or young adulthood.the lifetime rate of atypical anorexia nervosa, a form of ed-nos in which the person loses a significant amount of weight and is at risk for serious medical complications despite having a higher body-mass index, is much higher, at 5%.while anorexia became more commonly diagnosed during the 20th century it is unclear if this was due to an increase in its frequency or simply better diagnosis. most studies show that since at least 1970 the incidence of an in adult women is fairly constant, while there is some indication that the incidence may have been increasing for girls aged between 14 and 20. according to researcher ben radford who wrote in skeptical inquirer ""i found many examples of flawed, misleading, and sometimes completely wrong information and data being copied and widely disseminated among eating disorder organizations and educators without anyone bothering to consult the original research to verify its accuracy"". radford states that misleading statistics and data have been ignored by organizations like the national eating disorder association who has not released data for ""incidence of anorexia from 1984017"" he states that each agency continues to report incorrect numbers assuming that someone else has checked the accuracy.eating disorders are less reported in preindustrial, non-westernized countries than in western countries. in africa, not including south africa, the only data presenting information about eating disorders occurs in case reports and isolated studies, not studies investigating prevalence. data shows in research that in westernized civilizations, ethnic minorities have very similar rates of eating disorders, contrary to the belief that eating disorders predominantly occur in white people.men  male and female athletes are often overlooked as anorexic. research emphasizes the importance to take athletes diet, weight and symptoms into account when diagnosing anorexia,  instead of just looking at weight and bmi. for athletes, ritualized activities such as weigh-ins place emphasis on weight, which may promote the development of eating disorders among them.  while women use diet pills, which is an indicator of unhealthy behavior and an eating disorder, men use steroids, which contextualizes the beauty ideals for genders. in a canadian study, 4% of boys in grade nine used anabolic steroids. anorexic men are sometimes referred to as manorexic.the term ""anorexia nervosa"" was coined in 1873 by sir william gull, one of queen victorias personal physicians. the history of anorexia nervosa begins with descriptions of religious fasting dating from the hellenistic era and continuing into the medieval period. the medieval practice of self-starvation by women, including some young women, in the name of religious piety and purity also concerns anorexia nervosa; it is sometimes referred to as anorexia mirabilis.the earliest medical descriptions of anorexic illnesses are generally credited to english physician richard morton in 1689. case descriptions fitting anorexic illnesses continued throughout the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries.in the late 19th century anorexia nervosa became widely accepted by the medical profession as a recognized condition. in 1873, sir william gull, one of queen victorias personal physicians, published a seminal paper which coined the term ""anorexia nervosa"" and provided a number of detailed case descriptions and treatments. in the same year, french physician ernest-charles las0th century, when german-american psychoanalyst hilde bruch published the golden cage: the enigma of anorexia nervosa in 1978.  despite major advances in neuroscience, bruchs theories tend to dominate popular thinking. a further important event was the death of the popular singer and drummer karen carpenter in 1983, which prompted widespread ongoing media coverage of eating disorders.the term is of greek origin: an- ",1,0
"karate   is a martial art developed in the ryukyu kingdom. it developed from the indigenous ryukyuan martial arts  karate is now predominantly a striking art using punching, kicking, knee strikes, elbow strikes and open-hand techniques such as knife-hands, spear-hands and palm-heel strikes. historically, and in some modern styles, grappling, throws, joint locks, restraints and vital-point strikes are also taught. a karate practitioner is called a karateka  it was systematically taught in japan after the taish6. in 1922 the japanese ministry of education invited gichin funakoshi to tokyo to give a karate demonstration. in 1924 keio university established the first university karate club in mainland japan, and by 1932 major japanese universities had karate clubs. in this era of escalating japanese militarism, the name was changed from 8 september 2015 karate featured on a shortlist  while the world karate federation claims there are 100 million practitioners around the world.karate was originally written as ""chinese hand"" in 1933, the okinawan art of karate was recognized as a japanese martial art by the japanese martial arts committee known as the ""butoku kai"". until 1935, ""karate"" was written as  ""016, the international olympic committee approved karate as an olympic sport beginning at the 2020 summer olympics.karate, although not widely used in mixed martial arts, has been effective for some mma practitioners.various styles of karate are practiced in mma: lyoto machida and john makdessi practice shotokan; bas rutten and georges st-pierre train in kyokushin; and michelle waterson holds a black belt in american free style karate.in 1924 gichin funakoshi, founder of shotokan karate, adopted the dan system from the judo founder jigoro kano using a rank scheme with a limited set of belt colors. other okinawan teachers also adopted this practice. in the ky0th century were exposed to japanese karate. after regaining independence from japan, many korean martial arts schools that opened up in the 1940s and 1950s were founded by masters who had trained in karate in japan as part of their martial arts training.won kuk lee, a korean student of funakoshi, founded the first martial arts school after the japanese occupation of korea ended in 1945, called the chung do kwan. having studied under gichin funakoshi at chuo university, lee had incorporated taekkyon, kung fu, and karate in the martial art that he taught which he called ""tang soo do"", the korean transliteration of the chinese characters for ""way of chinese hand""  in the mid-1950s, the martial arts schools were unified under president rhee syngmans order, and became taekwondo under the leadership of choi hong hi and a committee of korean masters. choi, a significant figure in taekwondo history, had also studied karate under funakoshi. karate also provided an important comparative model for the early founders of taekwondo in the formalization of their art including hyung and the belt ranking system. the original taekwondo hyung were identical to karate kata. eventually, original korean forms were developed by individual schools and associations. although the world taekwondo federation and international taekwon-do federation are the most prominent among korean martial arts organizations, tang soo do schools that teach japanese karate still exist as they were originally conveyed to won kuk lee and his contemporaries from funakoshi.karate appeared in the soviet union in the mid-1960s, during nikita khrushchevs policy of improved international relations. the first shotokan clubs were opened in moscows universities. in 1973, however, the government banned karate in japan. shotokai karate was introduced to england in 1963 by another of gichin funakoshis students, mitsusuke harada. outside of the shotokan stable of karate styles, wado ryu karate was also an early adopted style in the uk, introduced by tatsuo suzuki, a 6th dan at the time in 1964.despite the early adoption of shotokan in the uk, it was not until 1964 that jka shotokan officially came to the uk. bell had been corresponding with the jka in tokyo asking for his grades to be ratified in shotokan having apparently learnt that murakami was not a designated representative of the jka. the jka obliged, and without enforcing a grading on bell, ratified his black belt on 5 february 1964, though he had to relinquish his yoseikan grade. bell requested a visitation from jka instructors and the next year taiji kase, hirokazu kanazawa, keinosuke enoeda and hiroshi shirai gave the first jka demo at kensington town hall on 21 april 1965. hirokazu kanazawa and keinosuke enoeda stayed and murakami left in 1966, members of the former british karate federation established the karate union of great britain  and affiliated to jka. keinosuke enoeda came to england at the same time as kanazawa, teaching at a d003, the kugb elected andy sherry as chief instructor. shortly after this, a new association split off from kugb, jka england.an earlier significant split from the kugb took place in 1991 when a group led by kugb senior instructor steve cattle formed the english shotokan academy  in the 1950s, william j. dometrich, ed parker, cecil t. patterson, gordon doversola, donald hugh nagle, george mattson and peter urban all began instructing in the us.tsutomu ohshima began studying karate under shotokans founder, gichin funakoshi, while a student at waseda university, beginning in 1948. in 1957 ohshima received his godan in 1961 hidetaka nishiyama, a co-founder of the japan karate association  following the inclusion of judo at the 1964 tokyo olympics, there was growing mainstream western interest in japanese martial arts, particularly karate, during the 1960s. by the 1970s, martial arts films the karate kid  the success of the karate kid further popularized karate  karate kommandos is an animated childrens show, with chuck norris appearing to reveal the moral lessons contained in every episode.many other film stars such as bruce lee, chuck norris, jackie chan, sammo hung, and jet li come from a range of other martial arts.",1,0
"a firefighter is a rescuer extensively trained in firefighting, primarily to extinguish hazardous fires that threaten life, property, and the environment as well as to rescue people and in some cases or jurisdictions also animals from dangerous situations. male firefighters are sometimes referred to colloquially by the historical term fireman the fire service, also known in some countries as the fire brigade or fire department, is one of the three main emergency services. from urban areas to aboard ships, firefighters have become ubiquitous around the world.the skills required for safe operations are regularly practiced during training evaluations throughout a firefighters career. initial firefighting skills are normally taught through local, regional or state-approved fire academies or training courses. depending on the requirements of a department, additional skills and certifications such as technical rescue and pre-hospital medicine may also be acquired at this time.firefighters work closely with other emergency response agencies such as the police and emergency medical service. a firefighters role may overlap with both. fire investigators or fire marshals investigate the cause of a fire. if the fire was caused by arson or negligence, their work will overlap with law enforcement. firefighters also frequently provide some degree of emergency medical service, including certifying and working as full-time paramedics from engine, truck, and rescue companies in some systems to initiate advanced life support until ambulance transport arrives.the firefighting is further broken down into skills which include: size-up, extinguishing, ventilation, search and rescue, salvage, containment, mop up and overhaul.a fire burns due to the presence of three elements: fuel, oxygen and heat. this is often referred to as the fire triangle. sometimes it is known as the fire tetrahedron if a fourth element is added: a chemical chain reaction which can help sustain certain types of fire. the aim of firefighting is to deprive the fire of at least one of those elements. most commonly this is done by dousing the fire with water, though some fires require other methods such as foam or dry agents. firefighters are equipped with a wide variety of equipment for this purpose that include: ladder trucks, pumper trucks, tanker trucks, fire hose, and fire extinguishers.while sometimes fires can be limited to small areas of a structure, wider collateral damage due to smoke, water and burning embers is common. utility shutoff  priorities in fighting wildfires include preventing the loss of life and property.firefighters rescue people  in less common circumstances, firefighters rescue victims from hazardous materials emergencies as well as steep cliffs, embankment and high rises - the latter is referred to as high angle rescue, or rope rescue. many fire departments, including most in the united kingdom, refer to themselves as a fire and rescue service for this reason. large fire departments, such as the new york city fire department and london fire brigade, have specialist teams for advanced technical rescue. as building fires have been in decline for many years in developed countries such as the united states, rescues other than fires make up an increasing proportion of their firefighters work.firefighters frequently provide some degree of emergency medical care. in some jurisdictions first aid is the only medical training that firefighters have, and medical-only calls are the sole responsibility of a separate emergency medical services  bedroom homes.other methods of fire prevention are by directing efforts to reduce known hazardous conditions or by preventing dangerous acts before tragedy strikes. this is normally accomplished in many innovative ways such as conducting presentations, distributing safety brochures, providing news articles, writing public safety announcements heat injury is a major issue for firefighters as they wear insulated clothing and cannot shed the heat generated from physical exertion. early detection of heat issues is critical to stop dehydration and heat stress becoming fatal. early onset of heat stress affects cognitive function which combined with operating in dangerous environment makes heat stress and dehydration a critical issue to monitor. firefighter physiological status monitoring is showing promise in alerting ems and commanders to the status of their people on the fire ground. devices such as pass device alert 100 seconds after a firefighter has stopped moving in a structure. physiological status monitors measure a firefighters vital sign status, fatigue and exertion levels and transmit this information over their voice radio. this technology allows a degree of early warning to physiological stress. these devices are similar to technology developed for future force warrior and give a measure of exertion and fatigue. they also tell the people outside a building when they have stopped moving or fallen. this allows a supervisor to call in additional engines before the crew get exhausted and also gives an early warning to firefighters before they run out of air, as they may not be able to make voice calls over their radio. current osha tables exist for heat injury and the allowable amount of work in a given environment based on temperature, humidity and solar loading.firefighters are also at risk for developing rhabdomyolysis. rhabdomyolysis is the breakdown of muscle tissue and has many causes including heat exposure, high core body temperature, and prolonged, intense exertion. routine firefighter tasks, such as carrying extra weight of equipment and working in hot environments, can increase firefighters5% of fatalities of firefighters are caused by traffic collisions while responding to or returning from an incident. other firefighters have been injured or killed by vehicles at the scene of a fire or emergency  in addition to the direct dangers of firefighting, cardiovascular diseases account for approximately 45% of on duty firefighter deaths.firefighters have sometimes been assaulted by members of the public while responding to calls. these kinds of attacks can cause firefighters to fear for their safety and may cause them to not have full focus on the situation which could result in injury to their selves or the patient.once extinguished, fire debris cleanup poses several safety and health risks for workers.many hazardous substances are commonly found in fire debris.  silica can be found in concrete, roofing tiles, or it may be a naturally occurring element. occupational exposures to silica dust can cause silicosis, lung cancer, pulmonary tuberculosis, airway diseases, and some additional non-respiratory diseases.  inhalation of asbestos can result in various diseases including asbestosis, lung cancer, and mesothelioma. sources of metals exposure include burnt or melted electronics, cars, refrigerators, stoves, etc. fire debris cleanup workers may be exposed to these metals or their combustion products in the air or on their skin. these metals may include beryllium, cadmium, chromium, cobalt, lead, manganese, nickel, and many more. polyaromatic hydrocarbons safety hazards of fire cleanup include the risk of reignition of smoldering debris, electrocution from downed or exposed electrical lines or in instances where water has come into contact with electrical equipment. structures that have been burned may be unstable and at risk of sudden collapse.standard personal protective equipment for fire cleanup include hard hats, goggles or safety glasses, heavy work gloves, earplugs or other hearing protection, steel-toe boots, and fall protection devices. hazard controls for electrical injury include assuming all power lines are energized until confirmation they are de-energized, and grounding power lines to guard against electrical feedback, and using appropriate personal protective equipment. proper respiratory protection can protect against hazardous substances.  proper ventilation of an area is an engineering control that can be used to avoid or minimize exposure to hazardous substances.  when ventilation is insufficient or dust cannot be avoided, personal protective equipment such as n95 respirators can be used.firefighting has long been associated with poor cardiovascular outcomes. in the united states, the most common cause of on-duty fatalities for firefighters is sudden cardiac death. in addition to personal factors that may predispose an individual to coronary artery disease or other cardiovascular diseases, occupational exposures can significantly increase a firefighters risk. historically, the fire service blamed poor firefighter physical condition for being the primary cause of cardiovascular related deaths. however, over the last 20 years, studies and research has indicated the toxic gasses put fire service personnel at significantly higher risk for cardiovascular related conditions and death. for instance, carbon monoxide, present in nearly all fire environments, and hydrogen cyanide, formed during the combustion of paper, cotton, plastics, and other substances containing carbon and nitrogen. the substances inside of materials change during combustion their bi-products interfere with the transport of oxygen in the body. hypoxia can then lead to heart injury. in addition, chronic exposure to particulate matter in smoke is associated with atherosclerosis. noise exposures may contribute to hypertension and possibly ischemic heart disease. other factors associated with firefighting, such as stress, heat stress, and heavy physical exertion, also increase the risk of cardiovascular events.during fire suppression activities a firefighter can reach peak or near peak heart rates which can act as a trigger for a cardiac event. for example, tachycardia can cause plaque buildup to break loose and lodge itself is a small part of the heart causing myocardial infarction, also known as a heart attack. this along with unhealthy habits and lack of exercise can be very hazardous to firefighter health.a 2015 retrospective longitudinal study showed that firefighters are at higher risk for certain types of cancer. firefighters had mesothelioma, which is caused by asbestos exposure, at twice the rate of the non-firefighting working population. younger firefighters  preliminary research from 2015 on a large cohort of us firefighters showed a direct relationship between the number of hours spent fighting fires and lung cancer and leukemia mortality in firefighters. this link is a topic of continuing research in the medical community, as is cancer mortality in general among firefighters.firefighters are exposed to a variety of carcinogens at fires, including both carcinogenic chemicals and radiation as with other emergency workers, firefighters may witness traumatic scenes during their careers. they are thus more vulnerable than most people to certain mental health issues such as post-traumatic stress disorder and suicidal thoughts and behaviors. among women in the us, the occupations with the highest suicide rates are police and firefighters, with a rate of 14.1 per 100 000, according to the national center for injury prevention and control, cdc. chronic stress over time attributes to symptoms that affect first responders, such as anxiousness, irritability, nervousness, memory and concentration problems can occur overtime which can lead to anxiety and depression. mental stress can have long lasting affects on the brain. a 2014 report from the national fallen firefighters foundation found that a fire department is three times more likely to experience a suicide in a given year than a line-of-duty death. mental stress of the job can lead to substance abuse and alcohol abuse as ways of coping with the stress. the mental stress of fire fighting has a lot of different causes. there are those they see on duty and also what they miss by being on duty. firefighters schedules fluctuate by district. there are stations where fire fighters work 48 hours on and 48 hours off. some allow 24 hours on and 72 hours off. the mental impact of missing your childs first steps or a ballet recital can take a heavy impact on first responders. there is also the stress of being on opposite shifts as your spouse or being away from family. another long-term risk factor from firefighting is exposure to high levels of sound, which can cause noise-induced hearing loss  nihl affects sound frequencies between 3,000 and 6,000 hertz first, then with more frequent exposure, will spread to more frequencies. many consonants will be more difficult to hear or inaudible with nihl because of the higher frequencies effected, which results in poorer communication. nihl is caused by exposure to sound levels at or above 85dba according to niosh and at or above 90dba according to osha. dba represents a-weighted decibels. dba is used for measuring sound levels relating to occupational sound exposure since it attempts to mimic the sensitivity of the human ear to different frequencies of sound. osha uses a 5-dba exchange rate, which means that for every 5dba increase in sound from 90dba, the acceptable exposure time before a risk of permanent hearing loss occurs decreases by half  niosh uses a 3-dba exchange rate starting at 8 hours acceptable exposure time at 85dba.the time of exposure required to potentially cause damage depends on the level of sound exposed to.  the most common causes of excessive sound exposure are sirens, transportation to and from fires, fire alarms, and work tools. traveling in an emergency vehicle has shown to expose a person to between 103 and 114dba of sound. according to osha, exposure at this level is acceptable for between 17 and 78 minutes and according to niosh is acceptable for between 35 seconds and 7.5 minutes  over a 24-hour day before permanent hearing loss can occur. this time period considers that no other high level sound exposure occurs in that 24-hour time frame. sirens often output about 1204-hour time period before permanent hearing loss can occur. in addition to high sound levels, another risk factor for hearing disorders is the co-exposure to chemicals that are ototoxic.the average day of work for a firefighter can often be under the sound exposure limit for both osha and niosh. while the average day of sound exposure as a firefighter is often under the limit, firefighters can be exposed to impulse noise, which has a very low acceptable time exposure before permanent hearing damage can occur due to the high intensity and short duration.there are also high rates of hearing loss, often nihl, in firefighters, which increases with age and number of years working as a firefighter. hearing loss prevention programs have been implemented in multiple stations and have shown to help lower the rate of firefighters with nihl. other attempts have been made to lower sound exposures for firefighters, such as enclosing the cabs of the firetrucks to lower the siren exposure while driving. nfpa  while nihl can be a risk that occurs from working as a firefighter, nihl can also be a safety concern for communicating while doing the job as communicating with coworkers and victims is essential for safety. hearing protection devices have been used by firefighters in the united states. earmuffs are the most commonly used hearing protection device  multiple fire departments have used hpds that have communication devices built in, allowing firefighters to speak with each other at safe, but audible sound levels, while lowering the hazardous sound levels around them.in a country with a comprehensive fire service, fire departments must be able to send firefighters to emergencies at any hour of day or night, to arrive on the scene within minutes. in urban areas, this means that full-time paid firefighters usually have shift work, with some providing cover each night. on the other hand, it may not be practical to employ full-time firefighters in villages and isolated small towns, where their services may not be required for days at a time. for this reason, many fire departments have firefighters who spend long periods on call to respond to infrequent emergencies; they may have regular jobs outside of firefighting. whether they are paid or not varies by country. in the united states and germany, volunteer fire departments provide most of the cover in rural areas. in the united kingdom and ireland, by contrast, actual volunteers are rare. instead, ""retained firefighters"" are paid for responding to incidents, along with a small salary for spending long periods of time on call.a key difference between many countrys fire services is what the balance is between full-time and volunteer  volunteers play a substantial role even in the largest fire departments, including berlins, which serves a population of 3.6 million. regardless of how this balance works, a common feature is that smaller urban areas have a mix of full-time and volunteer/on-call firefighters. this is known in the united states as a combination fire department. in chile and peru, all firefighters are volunteers.another point of variation is how the fire services are organized. some countries like israel and new zealand have a single national fire service. others like australia, the united kingdom and france organize fire services based on regions or sub-national states. in the united states, germany and canada, fire departments are run at a municipal level.atypically, singapore and many parts of switzerland have fire service conscription. in germany, conscription can also be used if a village does not have a functioning fire service. other unusual arrangements are seen in denmark, where most fire services are run by private companies, and in france, where two of the countrys fire services  a final point in variation is how involved firefighters are in emergency medical services.the expedient and accurate handling of fire alarms or calls are significant factors in the successful outcome of any incident. fire department communications play a critical role in that successful outcome. fire department communications include the methods by which the public can notify the communications center of an emergency, the methods by which the center can notify the proper fire fighting forces, and the methods by which information is exchanged at the scene. one method is to use a megaphone to communicate.a telecommunicator   has a role different from but just as important as other emergency personnel. the telecommunicator must process calls from unknown and unseen individuals, usually calling under stressful conditions. he/she must be able to obtain complete, reliable information from the caller and prioritize requests for assistance. it is the dispatchers responsibility to bring order to chaos.while some fire departments are large enough to utilize their own telecommunication dispatcher, most rural and small areas rely on a central dispatcher to provide handling of fire, rescue, and police services.firefighters are trained to use communications equipment to receive alarms, give and receive commands, request assistance, and report on conditions. since firefighters from different agencies routinely provide mutual aid to each other, and routinely operate at incidents where other emergency services are present, it is essential to have structures in place to establish a unified chain of command, and share information between agencies. the u.s. federal emergency management agency  one component of this system is the incident command system.all radio communication in the united states is under authorization from the federal communications commission new south wales rural fire servicenew rank structure of 2015.ranks amongst canadian firefighters vary across the country and ranking appears mostly with larger departments:torontomontrealvancouverranks are divided between company officers and fire department officers, which can be subdivided between active officers  fire companies were composed of citizens who volunteered their time to help protect the community. as time progressed and new towns were established throughout the region, there was a sharp increase in the number of volunteer departments. in 1853, the first career fire department in the united states was established in cincinnati, ohio, followed four years later by st. louis fire department. large cities began establishing paid, full-time staff in order to try facilitate greater call volume. city fire departments draw their funding directly from city taxes and share the same budget as other public works like the police department and trash services. the primary difference between municipality departments and city departments is the funding source. municipal fire departments do not share their budget with any other service and are considered to be private entities within a jurisdiction. this means that they have their own taxes that feed into their budgeting needs. city fire departments report to the mayor, whereas municipal departments are accountable to elected board officials who help maintain and run the department along with the chief officer staff.funds for firefighting equipment may be raised by the firefighters themselves, especially in the case of volunteer organizations. events such as pancake breakfasts and chili feeds are common in the united states. social events are used to raise money include dances, fairs, and car washes. media related to

"the term happiness is used in the context of mental or emotional states, including positive or pleasant emotions ranging from contentment to intense joy. it is also used in the context of life satisfaction, subjective well-being, eudaimonia, flourishing and well-being.since the 1960s, happiness research has been conducted in a wide variety of scientific disciplines, including gerontology, social psychology and positive psychology, clinical and medical research and happiness economics.happiness is the subject of debate on usage and meaning, and on possible differences in understanding by culture.the word is mostly used in relation to two factors:some usages can include both of these factors. subjective well-being  includes measures of current experience  for instance sonja lyubomirsky has described happiness as 004 darrin mcmahon claimed, that over time the emphasis shifted from the happiness of virtue to the virtue of happiness.personal happiness aims can be effected by cultural factors. hedonism appears to be more strongly related to happiness in more individualistic cultures.cultural views on happiness have changed over time. for instance western concern about childhood being a time of happiness has occurred only since the 19th century.not all cultures seek to maximise happiness, and some cultures are averse to happiness.people in countries with high cultural religiosity tend to relate their life satisfaction less to their emotional experiences than people in more secular countries.happiness forms a central theme of buddhist teachings. for ultimate freedom from suffering, the noble eightfold path leads its practitioner to nirvana, a state of everlasting peace. ultimate happiness is only achieved by overcoming craving in all forms. more mundane forms of happiness, such as acquiring wealth and maintaining good friendships, are also recognized as worthy goals for lay people in advaita vedanta, the ultimate goal of life is happiness, in the sense that duality between atman and brahman is transcended and one realizes oneself to be the self in all.patanjali, author of the yoga sutras, wrote quite exhaustively on the psychological and ontological roots of bliss.the chinese confucian thinker mencius, who had sought to give advice to ruthless political leaders during chinas warring states period, was convinced that the mind played a mediating role between the ""lesser self"" happiness or simcha  the biblical verse ""worship the lord with gladness; come before him with joyful songs,""  a popular teaching by rabbi nachman of breslov, a 19th-century chassidic rabbi, is ""mitzvah gedolah lehiyot besimcha tamid,"" it is a great mitzvah the primary meaning of ""happiness"" in various european languages involves good fortune, chance or happening. the meaning in greek philosophy, however, refers primarily to ethics.in catholicism, the ultimate end of human existence consists in felicity, latin equivalent to the greek eudaimonia, or ""blessed happiness"", described by the 13th-century philosopher-theologian thomas aquinas as a beatific vision of gods essence in the next life.according to st. augustine and thomas aquinas, mans last end is happiness: ""all men agree in desiring the last end, which is happiness."" however, where utilitarians focused on reasoning about consequences as the primary tool for reaching happiness, aquinas agreed with aristotle that happiness cannot be reached solely through reasoning about consequences of acts, but also requires a pursuit of good causes for acts, such as habits according to virtue. in turn, which habits and acts that normally lead to happiness is according to aquinas caused by laws: natural law and divine law. these laws, in turn, were according to aquinas caused by a first cause, or god.according to aquinas, happiness consists in an ""operation of the speculative intellect"": ""consequently happiness consists principally in such an operation, viz. in the contemplation of divine things."" and, ""the last end cannot consist in the active life, which pertains to the practical intellect."" so: ""therefore the last and perfect happiness, which we await in the life to come, consists entirely in contemplation. but imperfect happiness, such as can be had here, consists first and principally in contemplation, but secondarily, in an operation of the practical intellect directing human actions and passions.""human complexities, like reason and cognition, can produce well-being or happiness, but such form is limited and transitory. in temporal life, the contemplation of god, the infinitely beautiful, is the supreme delight of the will. beatitudo, or perfect happiness, as complete well-being, is to be attained not in this life, but the next.al-ghazali theories on how to achieve happiness include ""encountering unexpected positive events"", ""seeing a significant other"", and ""basking in the acceptance and praise of others"".however others believe that happiness is not solely derived from external, momentary pleasures.maslows hierarchy of needs is a pyramid depicting the levels of human needs, psychological, and physical. when a human being ascends the steps of the pyramid, he reaches self-actualization. beyond the routine of needs fulfillment, maslow envisioned moments of extraordinary experience, known as peak experiences, profound moments of love, understanding, happiness, or rapture, during which a person feels more whole, alive, self-sufficient, and yet a part of the world. this is similar to the flow concept of mih000 the field of positive psychology has expanded drastically in terms of scientific publications, and has produced many different views on causes of happiness, and on factors that correlate with happiness. numerous short-term self-help interventions have been developed and demonstrated to improve happiness.various writers, including camus and tolle, have written that the act of searching or seeking for happiness is incompatible with being happy.john stuart mill believed that for the great majority of people happiness is best achieved en passant, rather than striving for it directly. this meant no self-consciousness, scrutiny, self-interrogation, dwelling on, thinking about, imagining or questioning on ones happiness. then, if otherwise fortunately circumstanced, one would ""inhale happiness with the air you breathe.""william inge observed that ""on the whole, the happiest people seem to be those who have no particular cause for being happy except the fact that they are so."" orison swett marden said ""some people are born happy. no matter what their circumstances are they are joyous, content and satisfied with everything. they carry a perpetual holiday in their eye and see joy and beauty everywhere. when we meet them they impress us as just having met with some good luck, or that they have some good news to tell you. like the bees that extract honey from every flower, they have a happy alchemy which transmutes even gloom into sunshine.""some studies, including 2018 work by june gruber a psychologist at university of colorado, have suggested that seeking happiness can have negative effects, such as failure to meet over-high expectations. a 2012 study found that psychological well-being was higher for people who experienced both positive and negative emotions. other research has analysed possible trade-offs between happiness and meaning in life.not all cultures seek to maximise happiness.sigmund freud said that all humans strive after happiness, but that the possibilities of achieving it are restricted because we ""are so made that we can derive intense enjoyment only from a contrast and very little from the state of things.""happiness can be examined in experiential and evaluative contexts. experiential well-being, or ""objective happiness"", is happiness measured in the moment via questions such as ""how good or bad is your experience now?"". in contrast, evaluative well-being asks questions such as ""how good was your vacation?"" and measures ones subjective thoughts and feelings about happiness in the past. experiential well-being is less prone to errors in reconstructive memory, but the majority of literature on happiness refers to evaluative well-being. the two measures of happiness can be related by heuristics such as the peak-end rule.some commentators focus on the difference between the hedonistic tradition of seeking pleasant and avoiding unpleasant experiences, and the eudaimonic tradition of living life in a full and deeply satisfying way.people have been trying to measure happiness for centuries. in 1780, the english utilitarian philosopher jeremy bentham proposed that as happiness was the primary goal of humans it should be measured as a way of determining how well the government was performing.several scales have been developed to measure happiness:since 2012, a world happiness report has been published. happiness is evaluated, as in 012, following bhutan, which had already been measuring gross national happiness.happiness has been found to be quite stable over time.as of 2016, no evidence of happiness causing improved physical health has been found; the topic is being researched at the lee kum sheung center for health and happiness at the harvard t.h. chan school of public health. a positive relationship has been suggested between the volume of the brains gray matter in the right precuneus area and ones subjective happiness score. happiness is partly genetically based. based on twin studies, 50 percent of a given humans happiness level could be genetically determined, 10 percent is affected by life circumstances and situation, and a remaining 40 percent of happiness is subject to self-control.in politics, happiness as a guiding ideal is expressed in the united states declaration of independence of 1776, written by thomas jefferson, as the universal right to ""the pursuit of happiness."" this seems to suggest a subjective interpretation but one that goes beyond emotions alone. it has to be kept in mind that the word happiness meant ""prosperity, thriving, wellbeing"" in the 18th century and not the same thing as it does today. in fact, happiness.common market health measures such as gdp and gnp have been used as a measure of successful policy. on average richer nations tend to be happier than poorer nations, but this effect seems to diminish with wealth. this has been explained by the fact that the dependency is not linear but logarithmic, i.e., the same percentual increase in the gnp produces the same increase in happiness for wealthy countries as for poor countries. increasingly, academic economists and international economic organisations are arguing for and developing multi-dimensional dashboards which combine subjective and objective indicators to provide a more direct and explicit assessment of human wellbeing. work by paul anand and colleagues helps to highlight the fact that there many different contributors to adult wellbeing, that happiness judgement reflect, in part, the presence of salient constraints, and that fairness, autonomy, community and engagement are key aspects of happiness and wellbeing throughout the life course.libertarian think tank cato institute claims that economic freedom correlates strongly with happiness preferably within the context of a western mixed economy, with free press and a democracy. according to certain standards, east european countries when ruled by communist parties were less happy than western ones, even less happy than other equally poor countries.since 2003, empirical research in the field of happiness economics, such as that by benjamin radcliff, professor of political science at the university of notre dame, supported the contention that in democratic countries life satisfaction is strongly and positively related to the social democratic model of a generous social safety net, pro-worker labor market regulations, and strong labor unions. similarly, there is evidence that public policies which reduce poverty and support a strong middle class, such as a higher minimum wage, strongly affect average levels of well-being.it has been argued that happiness measures could be used not as a replacement for more traditional measures, but as a supplement. according to the cato institute, people constantly make choices that decrease their happiness, because they have also more important aims. therefore, government should not decrease the alternatives available for the citizen by patronizing them but let the citizen keep a maximal freedom of choice.good mental health and good relationships contribute more than income to happiness and governments should take these into account.research on positive psychology, well-being, eudaimonia and happiness, and the theories of diener, ryff, keyes, and seligmann covers a broad range of levels and topics, including ""the biological, personal, relational, institutional, cultural, and global dimensions of life."" the psychiatrist george vaillant and the director of longitudinal study of adult development at harvard university robert j. waldinger found that those who were happiest and healthier reported strong interpersonal relationships. research showed that adequate sleep contributes to well-being. in 2018, laurie r. santos course titled ""psychology and the good life"" became the most popular course in the history of yale university and was made available for free online to non-yale students.",1,0
"an aircraft pilot or aviator is a person who controls the flight of an aircraft by operating its directional flight controls. some other aircrew members, such as navigators or flight engineers, are also considered aviators, because they are involved in operating the aircrafts navigation and engine systems. other aircrew members, such as drone operators, flight attendants, mechanics and ground crew, are not classified as aviators.in recognition of the pilots qualifications and responsibilities, most militaries and many airlines worldwide award aviator badges to their pilots.the first recorded use of the term aviator to ensure the safety of people in the air and on the ground, early aviation soon required that aircraft be under the operational control of a properly trained, certified pilot at all times, who is responsible for the safe and legal completion of the flight. the  a0 years from 2018, 635,000 for commercial aviation, 96,000 for business aviation and 59,000 for helicopters: 33% in asia pacific by november 2017, due a shortage of qualified pilots, some pilots were leaving corporate aviation to return to airlines. in one example a global 6000 pilot, making $250,000 a year for 10 to 15 flight hours a month, returned to american airlines with full seniority.a gulfstream g650 or global 6000 pilot might earn between $245,000 and $265,000, and recruiting one may require up to $300,000.at the other end of the spectrum, constrained by the available pilots, some small carriers hire new pilots who need 300 hours to jump to airlines in a year. they may also recruit non-career pilots who have other jobs or airline retirees who want to continue to fly.the number of airline pilots could decrease as automation replaces copilots and eventually pilots as well. in january 2017 rhett ross, ceo of continental motors said ""my concern is that in the next two decades0 years from now will be 2037 and our would-be careerist will be 38017 financial company ubs predicted pilotless airliners are technically feasible and could appear around 2025, offering around $35bn of savings, mainly in pilot costs: $26bn for airlines, $3bn for business jets and $2.1bn for civil helicopters; $3bn/year from lower pilot training and aviation insurance costs due to safer flights; $1bn from flight optimisation avweb reporter geoff rapoport stated, ""pilotless aircraft are an appealing prospect for airlines bracing for the need to hire several hundred thousand new pilots in the next decade. wages and training costs have been rapidly rising at regional u.s. airlines over the last several years as the major airlines have hired pilots from the regionals at unprecedented rates to cover increased air travel demand from economic expansion and a wave of retirements"".going to pilotless airliners could be done in one bold step or in gradual improvements like by reducing the cockpit crew for long haul missions or allowing single pilot cargo aircraft. the industry has not decided how to proceed yet. present automated systems are not autonomous and must be monitored; their replacement could require artificial intelligence with machine learning while present certified software is deterministic.as the airbus a350 would only need minor modifications, air caraibes and french bee parent groupe dubreuil see two-pilot crews in long-haul operations, without a third pilot for rotation, happening around 2024025.single-pilot freighters could start with regional flights.the air line pilots association believe removing pilots would threaten aviation safety and opposes the april 2018 faa reauthorization acts section 744 establishing a research and development program to assist single-pilot cargo aircraft by remote and computer piloting.for french aerospace research center onera and avionics manufacturer thales, artificial intelligence in some countries, such as pakistan, thailand and several african nations, there is a strong relationship between the military and the principal national airlines, and many airline pilots come from the military; however, that is no longer the case in the united states and western europe. while the flight decks of u.s. and european airliners do have ex-military pilots, many pilots are civilians. military training and flying, while rigorous, is fundamentally different in many ways from civilian piloting.operating an aircraft in canada is regulated by the aeronautics act of 1985 and the canadian aviation regulations provide rules for pilot licensing in canada.retirement age is provided by each airline with some set to age 60, but changes to the canadian human rights act have restricted retirement age set by the airlines.in the united states in 2018, there were 633,317 active pilots. this was down from a high of over 800,000 active pilots in 1980.in 1930, the air commerce act established pilot licensing requirements for american civil aviation.commercial airline pilots in the united states have a mandatory retirement age of 65, having increased from age 60 in 2007.military pilots fly with the armed forces, primarily the air forces, of a government or nation-state. their tasks involve combat and non-combat operations, including direct hostile engagements and support operations. military pilots undergo specialized training, often with weapons. examples of military pilots include fighter pilots, bomber pilots, transport pilots, test pilots and astronauts.military pilots are trained with a different syllabus than civilian pilots, which is delivered by military instructors. this is due to the different aircraft, flight goals, flight situations and chains of responsibility. many military pilots do transfer to civilian-pilot qualification after they leave the military, and typically their military experience provides the basis for a civilian pilots license.unmanned aerial vehicles the general concept of an airplane pilot can be applied to human spaceflight, as well. the spacecraft pilot is the astronaut who directly controls the operation of a spacecraft. this term derives directly from the usage of the word ""pilot"" in aviation, where it is synonymous with ""aviator"".pilots are required to go through many hours of flight training and theoretical study, that differ depending on the country. the first step is acquiring the private pilot license  some countries/carriers require/use a multi crew coordination (mcc.",1,0
"kentucky  officially the commonwealth of kentucky, is a state in the southern region of the united states, bordered by illinois, indiana, and ohio to the north; west virginia and virginia to the east; tennessee to the south; and missouri to the west. the bluegrass region in the central part of the state contains the states capital, frankfort, as well as its two largest cities, louisville and lexington. together they comprise more than 20% of the states population. kentucky is the 37th most extensive and the 26th most populous of the 50 united states.kentucky was admitted into the union as the 15th state on june 1, 1792, splitting from virginia in the process. it is known as the ""bluegrass state"", a nickname based on kentucky bluegrass, a species of grass found in many of its pastures, which has supported the thoroughbred horse industry in the center of the state. it is home to the worlds longest cave system: mammoth cave national park, as well as the greatest length of navigable waterways and streams in the contiguous united states and the two largest man-made lakes east of the mississippi river. the state is also known for horse racing, bourbon, moonshine, coal, ""my old kentucky home"" historic state park, automobile manufacturing, tobacco, bluegrass music, college basketball, louisville slugger. for instance, northbound travelers on u.s. 41 from henderson, after crossing the ohio river, will be in kentucky for about two miles kentucky has a non-contiguous part known as kentucky bend, at the far west corner of the state. it exists as an exclave surrounded completely by missouri and tennessee, and is included in the boundaries of fulton county. road access to this small part of kentucky on the mississippi river  requires a trip through tennessee.the epicenter of the 1811 new madrid earthquakes was near this area, causing the mississippi river to flow backwards in some places. though the series of quakes changed the area geologically and affected the small number of inhabitants of the area at the time, the kentucky bend is the result of a surveying error, not the new madrid earthquake.kentucky can be divided into five primary regions: the cumberland plateau in the east, which contains much of the historic coal mines; the north-central bluegrass region, where the major cities and the capital are located; the south-central and western pennyroyal plateau  temperatures in kentucky usually range from daytime summer highs of 879,006 birds taken during the 23-day season in spring 2009.in 1991 the land between the lakes partnered with the u.s. fish and wildlife service for the red wolf recovery program, a captive breeding program.it is not known exactly when the first humans arrived in what is now kentucky. based on evidence in other regions, humans were likely living in kentucky prior to 10,000 bce, but ""archaeological evidence of their occupation has yet to be documented"". around 1800 bce, a gradual transition began from a hunter-gatherer economy to agriculturalism. around 900 ce, a mississippian culture took root in western and central kentucky; by contrast, a fort ancient culture appeared in eastern kentucky. while the two had many similarities, the distinctive ceremonial earthwork mounds constructed in the formers centers were not part of the culture of the latter.in about the 10th century, the kentucky native peoples variety of corn became highly productive, supplanting the eastern agricultural complex, and replaced it with a maize-based agriculture in the mississippian era. french explorers in the 17th century documented numerous tribes living in kentucky until the beaver wars in the 1670s; however, by the time that european colonial explorers and settlers began entering kentucky in greater numbers in the mid-18th century, there were no major native american settlements in the region.as of the 16th century, the area known as kentucky was home to tribes from five different culture groups00. isaac shelby, a military veteran from virginia, was elected its first governor.central kentucky, the bluegrass region, was the area of the state with the most slave owners. planters cultivated tobacco and hemp  although frequently described as never having seceded, representatives from 68 of 110 counties met at russellville calling themselves the ""convention of the people of kentucky"" and passed an ordinance of secession on november 20, 1861. they established a confederate government of kentucky with its capital in bowling green.though kentucky was represented by the central star on the confederate battle flag, it remained officially ""neutral"" throughout the war due to the union sympathies of a majority of the commonwealths citizens. some 21st-century kentuckians observe confederate memorial day on confederate leader jefferson davis birthday, june 3, and participate in confederate battle re-enactments. both davis and u.s. president abraham lincoln were born in kentucky.on january 30, 1900, governor william goebel, flanked by two bodyguards, was mortally wounded by an assassin while walking to the state capitol in downtown frankfort. goebel was contesting the kentucky gubernatorial election of 1899, which william s. taylor was initially believed to have won. for several months, j. c. w. beckham, goebels running mate, and taylor fought over who was the legal governor, until the supreme court of the united states ruled in may in favor of beckham. after fleeing to indiana, taylor was indicted as a co-conspirator in goebels assassination. goebel is the only governor of a u.s. state to have been assassinated while in office.the black patch tobacco wars, a vigilante action, occurred in western kentucky in the early 20th century. as a result of the tobacco industry monopoly, tobacco farmers in the area were forced to sell their crops at prices that were too low. many local farmers and activists united in a refusal to sell their crops to the major tobacco companies.an association meeting occurred in downtown guthrie, where a vigilante wing of ""night riders"", formed. the riders terrorized farmers who sold their tobacco at the low prices demanded by the tobacco corporations. they burned several tobacco warehouses throughout the area, stretching as far west as hopkinsville to princeton. in the later period of their operation, they were known to physically assault farmers who broke the boycott. governor augustus e. willson declared martial law and deployed the kentucky national guard to end the wars.on october 15, 1959, a b-52 carrying two nuclear weapons collided in midair with a kc-135 tanker near hardinsburg, kentucky. one of the nuclear bombs was damaged by fire but both weapons were recovered.kentucky is one of four u.s. states to officially use the term commonwealth. the term was used for kentucky as it had also been used by virginia, from which kentucky was created. the term has no particular significance in its meaning and was chosen to emphasize the distinction from the status of royal colonies as a place governed for the general welfare of the populace. kentucky was originally styled as the ""state of kentucky"" in the act admitting it to the union, since that is how it was referred to in kentuckys first constitution.the commonwealth term was used in citizen petitions submitted between 1786 and 1792 for the creation of the state. it was also used in the title of a history of the state that was published in 1834 and was used in various places within that book in references to virginia and kentucky. the other three states officially called ""commonwealths"" are massachusetts, pennsylvania, and virginia. puerto rico and the northern mariana islands are also formally commonwealths.kentucky is one of only five states that elect their state officials in odd-numbered years other elected constitutional offices include the secretary of state, attorney general, auditor of public accounts, state treasurer and commissioner of agriculture. currently, republican michael g. adams serves as the secretary of state. the commonwealths chief prosecutor, law enforcement officer, and law officer is the attorney general, currently republican daniel cameron. the auditor of public accounts is republican mike harmon. republican allison ball is the current treasurer. republican ryan quarles is the current commissioner of agriculture.kentuckys legislative branch consists of a bicameral body known as the kentucky general assembly.the senate is considered the upper house. it has 38 members, and is led by the president of the senate, currently robert stivers in november 2016, republicans won control of the house for the first time since 1922, and currently have supermajorities in both the house and senate.the judicial branch of kentucky is called the kentucky court of justice and comprises courts of limited jurisdiction called district courts; courts of general jurisdiction called circuit courts; specialty courts such as drug court and family court; an intermediate appellate court, the kentucky court of appeals; and a court of last resort, the kentucky supreme court.the kentucky court of justice is headed by the chief justice of the commonwealth. the chief justice is appointed by, and is an elected member of, the supreme court of kentucky. the current chief justice is john d. minton jr.unlike federal judges, who are usually appointed, justices serving on kentucky state courts are chosen by the states populace in non-partisan elections.kentuckys two u.s. senators are senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and rand paul, both republicans. the state is divided into six congressional districts, represented by republicans james comer  the statutes are enforced by local police, sheriffs and deputy sheriffs, and constables and deputy constables. unless they have completed a police academy elsewhere, these officers are required to complete police officer professional standards  additionally, in 1948, the kentucky general assembly established the kentucky state police, making it the 38th state to create a force whose jurisdiction extends throughout the given state.kentucky is one of the 32 states in the united states that sanctions the death penalty for certain murders defined as heinous. those convicted of capital crimes after march 31, 1998 are always executed by lethal injection; those convicted on or before this date may opt for the electric chair. only three people have been executed in kentucky since the u.s. supreme court re-instituted the practice in 1976. the most notable execution in kentucky was that of rainey bethea on august 14, 1936. bethea was publicly hanged in owensboro for the rape and murder of lischia edwards. irregularities with the execution led to this becoming the last public execution in the united states.kentucky has been on the front lines of the debate over displaying the ten commandments on public property. in the 2005 case of mccreary county v. aclu of kentucky, the u.s. supreme court upheld the decision of the sixth circuit court of appeals that a display of the ten commandments in the whitley city courthouse of mccreary county was unconstitutional. later that year, judge richard fred suhrheinrich, writing for the sixth circuit court of appeals in the case of aclu of kentucky v. mercer county, wrote that a display including the mayflower compact, the declaration of independence, the ten commandments, the magna carta, the star-spangled banner, and the national motto could be erected in the mercer county courthouse.kentucky has also been known to have unusually high political candidacy age laws, especially compared to surrounding states. the origin of this is unknown, but it has been suggested it has to do with the commonwealth tradition.a 2008 study found that kentuckys supreme court to be the least influential high court in the nation with its decisions rarely being followed by other states.where politics are concerned, kentucky historically has been very competitive. it leaned toward the democratic party since 1860, when the whig party dissolved and was considered among the democratic solid south, excepting three occasions when it went for the republican candidate. the southeastern section had aligned with the union during the war and tended to support republican candidates.in a reversal of the demographics of party alignment in the post-civil war nineteenth century, in the 21st century, state democrats include liberal whites, african americans, and other minorities. as of march 2020, 48.42% of the states voters were officially registered as democrats, and 42.75% were registered republican, who tend to be conservative whites. some 8.83% were registered with some other political party or as independents. despite this, a majority of the states voters have generally elected republican candidates for federal office since around the turn of the 21st century.from 1964 through 2004, kentucky voted for the eventual winner of the election for president of the united states; however, in the 2008 election the state lost its bellwether status. republican john mccain won kentucky, but he lost the national popular and electoral vote to democrat barack obama voters in the commonwealth supported the previous three democratic candidates elected to the white house in the late 20th century, all from southern states: lyndon b. johnson as of july 1, 2016, kentucky had an estimated population of 4,436,974, which is an increase of 12,363 from the prior year and an increase of 97,607, or 2.2%, since the year 2010. this includes a natural increase since the last census of 73,541 people , kentuckys population included about 149,016 foreign-born persons kentuckys population has grown during every decade since records have been kept. but during most decades of the 20th century there was also net out-migration from kentucky. since 1900, rural kentucky counties have had a net loss of more than a million people to migration, while urban areas have experienced a slight net gain.kentuckys

the status of ethnic american was an available option on the official census, the largest claimed ancestries in the commonwealth were english  in the states most urban counties of jefferson, oldham, fayette, boone, kenton, and campbell, german is the largest reported ancestry. americans of scots-irish and english stock are present throughout the entire state. many residents claim irish ancestry because of known ""scots-irish"" among their ancestors, who immigrated from ireland, where their ancestors had moved for a period from scotland during the plantation period.as of the 1980s, the only counties in the united states where over half of the population cited ""english"" as their only ancestry group were in the hills of eastern kentucky the ridgetop shawnee organized in the early 21st century as a non-profit to gain structure for their community and increase awareness of native americans in kentucky. in the 2000 census, some 20,000 people in the state identified as native american african americans, who were mostly enslaved at the time, made up 25% of kentuckys population before the civil war; they were held and worked primarily in the central bluegrass region, an area of hemp and tobacco cultivation, as well as raising blooded livestock. the number of african americans living in kentucky declined during the 20th century. many migrated during the early part of the century to the industrial north and midwest during the great migration for jobs and the chance to leave segregated, oppressive societies. today, less than 9% of the states total population is

was neither a failure nor a success. though it was meant to embrace southern values, many kentuckians rejected the slogan as cheesy and ineffective. it was quickly seen that the slogan did not encourage tourism as much as initially hoped for. so government decided to create a different slogan to embrace kentucky as a whole while also encouraging more people to visit the bluegrass.in 2004,

triangle as it contains a majority of the states wealth, population, population growth, and economic growth, it is also where most of the states largest cities by population are located. it is referred to the golden triangle as the metro areas of lexington, louisville, and northern kentucky/cincinnati outline a triangle shape. interstates i-71, i-75, and i-64 form the triangle shape.

university located in lexington, was founded in 1780 as the oldest university west of the allegheny mountains.berea college, located at the extreme southern edge of the bluegrass below the cumberland plateau, was the first coeducational college in the south to admit both black and white students, doing so from its very establishment in 1855. this policy was successfully challenged in the united

in that it is also influenced by the midwest and southern appalachia in certain areas of the state. the state is known for bourbon and whiskey distilling, tobacco, horse racing, and college basketball. kentucky is more similar to the upland south in terms of ancestry that is predominantly american.nevertheless, during the 19th century, kentucky did receive a substantial number of german immigrants, who settled mostly in the midwest, along the ohio river primarily in louisville, covington and newport. only maryland, delaware and west virginia have higher german ancestry percentages than kentucky among census-defined southern states, although kentuckys percentage is closer to arkansas and virginias than the previously named states percentages. scottish americans, english americans and scotch-irish americans have heavily influenced kentucky culture, and are present in every part of the state. as of the 1980s the only counties in the united states where more than half the population cited ""english"" as their only ancestry group were all in the hills of eastern kentucky kentucky was a slave state, and blacks once comprised over one-quarter of its population; however, it lacked the cotton plantation system and never had the same high percentage of african americans as most other slave states. while less than 8% of the total population is black, kentucky has a relatively significant rural african american population in the central and western areas of the state.kentucky adopted the jim crow system of racial segregation in most public spheres after the civil war. louisvilles 1914 ordinance for residential racial segregation was struck down by the us supreme court in 1917. however, in 1908 kentucky enacted the day law, ""an act to prohibit white and colored persons from attending the same school"", which berea college unsuccessfully challenged at the us supreme court in 1908; in 1948, lyman t. johnson filed suit for admission to the university of kentucky; as a result in the summer of 1949, nearly thirty african american students entered uk graduate and professional programs. kentucky integrated its schools after the 1954 brown v. board of

"homeschooling or home schooling, also known as home education or elective home education  was a common practice by family members and local communities. enlisting professional tutors was an option available only to the wealthy. homeschooling declined in the 19th and 20th centuries with the enactment of compulsory school attendance laws. however, it continued to be practised in isolated communities. homeschooling began a resurgence in the 1960s and 1970s with educational reformists dissatisfied with industrialized education.the earliest public schools in modern western culture were established during the reformation with the encouragement of martin luther in the german states of gotha and thuringia in 1524 and 1527. from the 1500s to 1800s the literacy rate increased until a majority of adults were literate, but development of the literacy rate occurred before the implementation of compulsory attendance and universal education.home education and apprenticeship continued to remain the main form of education until the 1830s. however, in the 18th century, the majority of people in europe lacked formal education. since the early 19th century, formal classroom schooling became the most common means of schooling throughout the developed countries.in 1647, new england provided compulsory elementary education. regional differences in schooling existed in colonial america. in the south, farms and plantations were so widely dispersed that community schools such as those in the more compact settlements of the north were impossible. in the middle colonies, the educational situation varied when comparing new york with new england.most native american tribal cultures traditionally used homeschooling and apprenticeship to pass knowledge to children. parents were supported by extended relatives and tribal leaders in the education of their children. the native americans vigorously resisted compulsory education in the united states.in the 1960s, rousas john rushdoony began to advocate homeschooling, which he saw as a way to combat the secular nature of the public school system in the united states. he vigorously attacked progressive school reformers such as horace mann and john dewey, and argued for the dismantling of the states influence in education in three works: intellectual schizophrenia, the messianic character of american education, and the philosophy of the christian curriculum. rushdoony was frequently called as an expert witness by the home school legal defense association during this time, american educational professionals raymond and dorothy moore began to research the academic validity of the rapidly growing early childhood education movement. this research included independent studies by other researchers and a review of over 8,000 studies bearing on early childhood education and the physical and mental development of children.they asserted that formal schooling before ages 8 not only lacked the anticipated effectiveness but also harmed children. the moores published their view that formal schooling was damaging young children academically, socially, mentally, and even physiologically. the moores presented evidence that childhood problems such as juvenile delinquency, nearsightedness, increased enrollment of students in special education classes and behavioral problems were the results of increasingly earlier enrollment of students. the moores cited studies demonstrating that orphans who were given surrogate mothers were measurably more intelligent, with superior long-term effects .in 1976, educator john holt published instead of education; ways to help people do things better. in its conclusion, he called for a ""childrens underground railroad"" to help children escape compulsory schooling. in response, holt was contacted by families from around the u.s. to tell him that they were educating their children at home. in 1977, after corresponding with a number of these families, holt began producing the magazine growing without schooling  holt was nicknamed the ""father of homeschooling."" holt later wrote a book about homeschooling, teach your own, in 1981.in 1980, holt said, ""i want to make it clear that i dont see homeschooling as some kind of answer to badness of schools. i think that the home is the proper base for the exploration of the world which we call learning or education. the home would be the best base no matter how good the schools were."" one common theme in the homeschool philosophies of both holt and that of the moores is that home education should not attempt to bring the school to construct into the home, or a view of education as an academic preliminary to life. they viewed home education as a natural, experiential aspect of life that occurs as the members of the family are involved with one another in daily living.homeschooling can be used as a form of supplemental education and as a way of helping children learn under specific circumstances. the term may also refer to instruction in the home under the supervision of correspondence schools or umbrella schools. some jurisdictions require adherence to an approved curriculum. in the 1970s, a modern homeschooling movement began when american educator and author john holt questioned the efficiency of schools and the sustainability of school learning, arguing that schools focus on strictly doing ""skill drill"" instead of other methods of learning. the influence of raymond moore is sometimes also held responsible for this movement on the religious right. a curriculum-free philosophy of homeschooling called ""unschooling"" also emerged around this time, although it would take a few more decades for this form of education to become popular. the term was coined in 1977 by holts gws. the term emphasizes the more spontaneous, less structured learning environment in which a childs interests drive his pursuit of knowledge. some parents provide a liberal arts education using the trivium and quadrivium as the main models.today, homeschooling is a relatively widespread form of education. while ""homeschooling"" is the term commonly used in north america, ""home education"" is primarily used in europe and many commonwealth countries. some believe that homeschooling has become more attractive and popular than ever before since the days of quick information retrieval on the internet.the covid-19 pandemic led to school closures around the world, which is why many students had to study from home. since the material to be learned was mainly outsourced to home and specified and checked by virtual schools, it can be said that this was mostly implemented in the form of distance education rather than traditional homeschooling in which parents educate their child independent from school. because the transition to homeschooling often happened overnight without any possibilities of preparation for parents and children, this caused economic, educational, political and psychological distress.there are a multitude of sometimes complex reasons why parents and children choose to homeschool, some of which overlap with those for unschooling and may be very different depending on the country and  some parents homeschool in order to have greater control over what and how their children are taught, to cater more adequately to an individual childs aptitudes and abilities, to provide instruction from a specific religious or moral position, and to take advantage of the efficiency of one-to-one instruction and thus allow the child to spend more time on childhood activities, socializing, and non-academic learning.some african-american families choose to homeschool as a way of increasing their childrens understanding of african-american history 3 per cent from ""their local public school or district."" in 2003, 41 per cent utilized some sort of distance learning, approximately 20 per cent by ""television, video or radio""; 19 per cent via ""the internet, e-mail, or the world wide web""; and 15 per cent taking a ""correspondence course by mail designed specifically for homeschoolers.""individual governmental units, e.g. states and local districts, vary in official curriculum and attendance requirements.as a subset of homeschooling, informal learning happens outside of the classroom but has no traditional boundaries of education. informal learning is an everyday form of learning through participation and creation, in contrast with the traditional view of teacher-centered learning. the term is often combined with non-formal learning and self-directed learning. informal learning differs from traditional learning since there are no expected objectives or outcomes. from the learners standpoint, the knowledge that they receive is not intentional. anything from planting a garden to baking a cake or even talking to a technician at work about the installation of new software can be considered informal learning. the individual is completing a task with different intentions but ends up learning skills in the process. children watching their tomato plants grow will not generate questions about photosynthesis but they will learn that their plants are growing with water and sunlight. this leads them to have a base understanding of complex scientific concepts without any background studying. the recent trend of homeschooling becoming less stigmatized has been in connection with the traditional waning of the idea that the state needs to be in primary and ultimate control over the education and upbringing of all children to create future adult citizens. this breeds an ever-growing importance on the ideas and concepts that children learn outside of the traditional classroom setting, including informal learning.depending on the part of the world, informal learning can take on many different identities and has differing cultural importances. many ways of organizing homeschooling draw on apprenticeship qualities and on non-western cultures. in some south american indigenous cultures, such as the chillihuani community in peru, children learn irrigation and farming technique through play, advancing them not only in their own village and society but also in their knowledge of realistic techniques that they will need to survive. in western culture, children use informal learning in two main ways. the first as talked about is through hands-on experience with new material. the second is asking questions to someone who has more experience than they have all other approaches to homeschooling are subsumed under two basic categories: structured and unstructured homeschooling. structured homeschooling includes any method or style of home education that follows a basic curriculum with articulated goals and outcomes. this style attempts to imitate the structure of the traditional school setting while personalizing the curriculum. unstructured homeschooling is any form of home education where parents do not construct a curriculum at all. unschooling, as it is known, attempts to teach through the childs daily experiences and focuses more on self-directed learning by the child, free of textbooks, teachers, and any formal assessment of success or failure.in a unit study approach, multiple subjects such as math, science, history, art, and geography, are studied in relation to a single topic. unit studies are useful for teaching multiple grades simultaneously as the difficulty level can be adjusted for each student. an extended form of unit studies, integrated thematic instruction utilizes one central theme integrated throughout the curriculum so that students finish a school year with a deep understanding of a certain broad subject or idea.all-in-one homeschooling curricula  these materials cover the same subject areas as public schools, allowing for an easy transition into the school system. these are among the most expensive options for homeschooling, but they require minimal preparation and are easy to use. there is, however, complete curriculum available for free, such as that available at allinonehomeschool.com. some localities provide the same materials used at local schools to homeschoolers. the purchase of a complete curriculum and their teaching/grading service from an accredited distance learning curriculum provider may allow students to obtain an accredited high school diploma.natural learning refers to a type of learning-on-demand where children pursue knowledge based on their interests and parents take an active part in facilitating activities and experiences conducive to learning but do not rely heavily on textbooks or spend much time ""teaching"", looking instead for ""learning moments"" throughout their daily activities. parents see their role as that of affirming through positive feedback and modeling the necessary skills, and the childs role as being responsible for asking and learning.the term unschooling as coined by john holt describes an approach in which parents do not authoritatively direct the childs education, but interact with the child following the childs own interests, leaving them free to explore and learn as their interests lead. ""unschooling"" does not indicate that the child is not being educated, but that the child is not being ""schooled"", or educated in a rigid school-type manner. holt asserted that children learn through the experiences of life, and he encouraged parents to live their lives with their child. also known as interest-led or child-led learning, unschooling attempts to follow opportunities as they arise in real life, through which a child will learn without coercion. children at school learn from 1 teacher and 2 auxiliary teachers in a classroom of approximately 30. kids have the opportunity of dedicated education at home with a ratio of 1 to 1. an unschooled child may utilize texts or classroom instruction, but these are not considered central to education. holt asserted that there is no specific body of knowledge that is, or should be, required of a child.both unschooling and natural learning advocates believe that children learn best by doing; a child may learn reading to further an interest about history or other cultures, or math skills by operating a small business or sharing in family finances. they may learn animal husbandry keeping dairy goats or meat rabbits, botany tending a kitchen garden, chemistry to understand the operation of firearms or the internal combustion engine, or politics and local history by following a zoning or historical-status dispute. while any type of homeschoolers may also use these methods, the unschooled child initiates these learning activities. the natural learner participates with parents and others in learning together.another prominent proponent of unschooling is john taylor gatto, author of dumbing us down, the exhausted school, a different kind of teacher, and weapons of mass instruction. gatto argues that public education is the primary tool of ""state-controlled consciousness"" and serves as a prime illustration of the total institution .0 as a way to simulate homeschool cooperatives online. with social networks, homeschoolers can chat, discuss threads in forums, share information and tips, and even participate in online classes via blackboard systems similar to those used by colleges.according to the home school legal defense association  home schooling achievement, a compilation of studies published by the hslda, supported the academic integrity of homeschooling. this booklet summarized a 1997 study by ray and the 1999 rudner study. the rudner study noted two limitations of its own research: it is not necessarily representative of all homeschoolers and it is not a comparison with other schooling methods. among the homeschooled students who took the tests, the average homeschooled student outperformed his public school peers by 30 to 37 percentile points across all subjects. the study also indicates that public school performance gaps between minorities and genders were virtually non-existent among the homeschooled students who took the tests.a survey of 11,739 homeschooled students conducted in 2008 found that, on average, the homeschooled students scored 37 percentile points above public school students on standardized achievement tests. this is consistent with the 1999 rudner study. however, rudner said that these same students in public school may have scored just as well because of the dedicated parents they had. the ray study also found that homeschooled students who had a certified teacher as a parent scored one percentile lower than homeschooled students who did not have a certified teacher as a parent. another nationwide descriptive study conducted by ray contained students ranging from ages 5011, a quasi-experimental study was conducted that included homeschooled and traditional public students between the ages of 5 and 10. it was discovered that the majority of the homeschooled children achieved higher standardized scores compared to their counterparts. however, martin-chang also found that unschooling children ages 5011 study suggests that a structured environment could play a key role in homeschooler academic achievement. this means that parents were highly involved in their childs education and they were creating clear educational goals. in addition, these students were being offered organized lesson plans which are either self-made or purchased.a study conducted by ray in 2010, indicates that the higher the level of parents income, the more likely the homeschooled child is able to achieve academic success.in the 1970s, raymond and dorothy moore conducted four federally funded analyses of more than 8,000 early childhood studies, from which they published their original findings in better late than early, 1975. this was followed by school can wait, a repackaging of these same findings designed specifically for educational professionals. they concluded that ""where possible, children should be withheld from formal schooling until at least ages eight to ten."" their reason was that children ""are not mature enough for formal school programs until their senses, coordination, neurological development and cognition are ready"". they concluded that the outcome of forcing children into formal schooling is a sequence of ""1 uncertainty as the child leaves the family nest early for a less secure environment, 2 puzzlement at the new pressures and restrictions of the classroom, 3 frustration because unready learning tools  very little time spent with peers, and 3 a great deal of free exploration under parental guidance."" their analysis suggested that children need ""more of home and less of

criticized that homeschooled children can be indoctrinated and manipulated quite easy when there is no extern influence and surveillance. however, there are also many people who think this is not a

"civil and political rights are a class of rights that protect individuals freedom from infringement by governments, social organizations, and private individuals. they ensure ones entitlement to participate in the civil and political life of society and the state without discrimination or repression.civil rights include the ensuring of peoples physical and mental integrity, life, and safety; protection from discrimination on grounds such as race, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, color, age, political affiliation, ethnicity, religion, and disability; and individual rights such as privacy and the freedom of thought, speech, religion, press, assembly, and movement.political rights include natural justice  they comprise the first portion of the 1948 universal declaration of human rights  after the edict of milan in 313, these rights included the freedom of religion; however in 380, the edict of thessalonica required all subjects of the roman empire to profess catholic christianity. roman legal doctrine was lost during the middle ages, but claims of universal rights could still be made based on christian doctrine. according to the leaders of ketts rebellion in the 17th century, english common law judge sir edward coke revived the idea of rights based on citizenship by arguing that englishmen had historically enjoyed such rights. the parliament of england adopted the english bill of rights in 1689. it was one of the influences drawn on by george mason and james madison when drafting the virginia declaration of rights in 1776. the virginia declaration is the direct ancestor and model for the u.s. bill of rights  their rights as derived from the laws of nature, and not as the gift of their chief magistrate.""the question of to whom civil and political rights apply is a subject of controversy. although in many countries citizens have greater protections against infringement of rights than non-citizens, civil and political rights are generally considered to be universal rights that apply to all persons.according to political scientist salvador santino f. regilme jr., analyzing the causes of and lack of protection from human rights abuses in the global south should be focusing on the interactions of domestic and international factors0, 1848.worldwide, several political movements for equality before the law occurred between approximately 1950 and 1980. these movements had a legal and constitutional aspect, and resulted in much law-making at both national and international levels. they also had an activist side, particularly in situations where violations of rights were widespread. movements with the proclaimed aim of securing observance of civil and political rights included:most civil rights movements relied on the technique of civil resistance, using nonviolent methods to achieve their aims. in some countries, struggles for civil rights were accompanied, or followed, by civil unrest and even armed rebellion. while civil rights movements over the last sixty years have resulted in an extension of civil and political rights, the process was long and tenuous in many countries, and many of these movements did not achieve or fully achieve their objectives.questions about civil and political rights have frequently emerged. for example, to what extent should the government intervene to protect individuals from infringement on their rights by other individuals, or from corporations1 of the 1948 universal declaration of human rights and later in the 1966 international covenant on civil and political rights. in europe, they were enshrined in the european convention on human rights in 1953.there are current organizations that exist to protect peoples civil and political rights in case they are infringed upon. the aclu is a well known non profit organization that helps to preserve freedom of speech and work to change policy. another organization is the naacp they focus on protecting the civil rights of minorities. these organizations serve a variety of causes one being the afl-cio, which are americas union that represent the working class people nationwide.",1,0
"jewellery or jewelry   the basic forms of jewellery vary between cultures but are often extremely long-lived; in european cultures the most common forms of jewellery listed above have persisted since ancient times, while other forms such as adornments for the nose or ankle, important in other cultures, are much less common.jewellery may be made from a wide range of materials. gemstones and similar materials such as amber and coral, precious metals, beads, and shells have been widely used, and enamel has often been important.  in most cultures jewellery can be understood as a status symbol, for its material properties, its patterns, or for meaningful symbols. jewellery has been made to adorn nearly every body part, from hairpins to toe rings, and even genital jewellery. in modern european culture the amount worn by adult males is relatively low compared with other cultures and other periods in european culture.the word jewellery itself is derived from the word jewel, which was anglicised from the old french ""jouel"", and beyond that, to the latin word ""jocale"", meaning plaything. in british english, indian english, new zealand english, hiberno-english, australian english, and south african english it is spelled jewellery, while the spelling is jewelry in american english.  both are used in canadian english, though jewelry prevails by a two to one margin. in french and a few other european languages the equivalent term, joaillerie, may also cover decorated metalwork in precious metal such as objets dart and church items, not just objects worn on the person.humans have used jewellery for a number of different reasons:most cultures at some point have had a practice of keeping large amounts of wealth stored in the form of jewellery. numerous cultures store wedding dowries in the form of jewellery or make jewellery as a means to store or display coins. alternatively, jewellery has been used as a currency or trade good; an example being the use of slave beads.many items of jewellery, such as brooches and buckles, originated as purely functional items, but evolved into decorative items as their functional requirement diminished.jewellery can symbolise group membership in creating jewellery, gemstones, coins, or other precious items are often used, and they are typically set into precious metals. platinum alloys range from 900 diamonds were first mined in india. pliny may have mentioned them, although there is some debate as to the exact nature of the stone he referred to as adamas. in 2005, australia, botswana, russia and canada ranked among the primary sources of gemstone diamond production. there are negative consequences of the diamond trade in certain areas. diamonds mined during the recent civil wars in angola, ivory coast, sierra leone, and other nations have been labelled as blood diamonds when they are mined in a war zone and sold to finance an insurgency.the british crown jewels contain the cullinan diamond, part of the largest gem-quality rough diamond ever found a popular style is the diamond solitaire, which features a single large diamond mounted prominently. within solitaire, there are 3 categories in which a ring can be classified into: prong, bezel and tension setting.jadejasperrubysapphireturquoisemany precious and semiprecious stones are used for jewellery. among them are:some gemstones for platinum, gold, and silver jewellery, there are many techniques to create finishes. the most common are high-polish, satin/matte, brushed, and hammered. high-polished jewellery is the most common and gives the metal a highly reflective, shiny look. satin, or matte finish reduces the shine and reflection of the jewellery, and this is commonly used to accentuate gemstones such as diamonds. brushed finishes give the jewellery a textured look and are created by brushing a material  later, sumptuary laws dictated who could wear what type of jewellery. this was also based on rank of the citizens of that time. cultural dictates have also played a significant role. for example, the wearing of earrings by western men was considered effeminate in the 19th century and early 20th century. more recently, the display of body jewellery, such as piercings, has become a mark of acceptance or seen as a badge of courage within some groups but is completely rejected in others. likewise, hip hop culture has popularised the slang term bling-bling, which refers to ostentatious display of jewellery by men or women.conversely, the jewellery industry in the early 20th century launched a campaign to popularise wedding rings for men, which caught on, as well as engagement rings for men, which did not, going so far as to create a false history and claim that the practice had medieval roots. by the mid-1940s, 85% of weddings in the u.s. featured a double-ring ceremony, up from 15% in the 1920s. religion has also played a role in societies influence. islam, for instance, considers the wearing of gold by men as a social taboo, and many religions have edicts against excessive display. in christianity, the new testament gives injunctions against the wearing of gold, in the writings of the apostles paul and peter. in revelation 17, ""the great whore"" or false religious system, is depicted as being ""decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a golden cup in her hand.""   christian denominations forbidding the use of jewellery by both men and women include amish-mennonites and holiness churches.the history of jewellery is long and goes back many years, with many different uses among different cultures. it has endured for thousands of years and has provided various insights into how ancient cultures worked.the earliest known jewellery was actually created not by humans later, the european early modern humans had crude necklaces and bracelets of bone, teeth, berries, and stone hung on pieces of string or animal sinew, or pieces of carved bone used to secure clothing together. in some cases, jewellery had shell or mother-of-pearl pieces.a decorated engraved pendant  in southern russia, carved bracelets made of mammoth tusk have been found. the venus of hohle fels features a perforation at the top, showing that it was intended to be worn as a pendant.around seven-thousand years ago, the first sign of copper jewellery was seen. in october 2012 the museum of ancient history in lower austria revealed that they had found a grave of a female jewellery worker 600500 bc; gold and lapis lazuli; length: 54600500 bc; gold and lapis lazuli; length: 22.57 bc, greek designs were heavily influenced by the roman culture. that is not to say that indigenous design did not thrive. numerous polychrome butterfly pendants on silver foxtail chains, dating from the 1st century, have been found near olbia, with only one example ever found anywhere else.the bees pendant, an iconic minoan jewel; 1700-1600 bc; gold; width: 4.6.7.9 36.5,000 years ago.the chinese used silver in their jewellery more than gold. blue kingfisher feathers were tied onto early chinese jewellery and later, blue gems and glass were incorporated into designs. however, jade was preferred over any other stone. the chinese revered jade because of the human-like qualities they assigned to it, such as its hardness, durability, and beauty. the first jade pieces were very simple, but as time progressed, more complex designs evolved. jade rings from between the 4th and 7th centuries bc show evidence of having been worked with a compound milling machine, hundreds of years before the first mention of such equipment in the west.in china, the most uncommon piece of jewellery is the earring, which was worn neither by men nor women. in modern times, earrings are still considered culturally taboo for men in china019, the chinese video streaming service iqiyi began blurring the ears of male actors wearing earrings. amulets were common, often with a chinese symbol or dragon. dragons, chinese symbols, and phoenixes were frequently depicted on jewellery designs.the chinese often placed their jewellery in their graves. most chinese graves found by archaeologists contain decorative jewellery.fluted ring with a dragon head  one of the first to start jewellery making were the peoples of the indus valley civilization  other pieces that women frequently wore were thin bands of gold that would be worn on the forehead, earrings, primitive brooches, chokers, and gold rings. although women wore jewellery the most, some men in the indus valley wore beads. small beads were often crafted to be placed in men and womens hair. the beads were about one millimetre long.a female skeleton according to hindu belief, gold and silver are considered as sacred metals. gold is symbolic of the warm sun, while silver suggests the cool moon. both are the quintessential metals of indian jewellery. pure gold does not oxidise or corrode with time, which is why hindu tradition associates gold with immortality.  gold imagery occurs frequently in ancient indian literature. in the vedic hindu belief of cosmological creation, the source of physical and spiritual human life originated in and evolved from a golden womb jewellery had great status with indias royalty; it was so powerful that they established laws, limiting wearing of jewellery to royalty. only royalty and a few others to whom they granted permission could wear gold ornaments on their feet. this would normally be considered breaking the appreciation of the sacred metals.  even though the majority of the indian population wore jewellery, maharajas and people related to royalty had a deeper connection with jewellery. the maharajas role was so important that the hindu philosophers identified him as central to the smooth working of the world. he was considered as a divine being, a deity in human form, whose duty was to uphold and protect dharma, the moral order of the universe.navaratna today, many of the jewellery designs and traditions are used, and jewellery is commonplace in indian ceremonies and weddings.pendant probably with siddha;

"in philosophy of self, self-awareness is the experience of ones own personality or individuality. it is not to be confused with consciousness in the sense of qualia. while consciousness is being aware of ones environment and body and lifestyle, self-awareness is the recognition of that awareness. self-awareness is how an individual consciously  knows and understands their own character, feelings, motives, and desires. there are two broad categories of self-awareness: internal self-awareness and external self-awareness.there are questions regarding what part of the brain allows us to be self-aware and how we are biologically programmed to be self-aware. v.s. ramachandran has speculated that mirror neurons may provide the neurological basis of human self-awareness. in an essay written for the edge foundation in 2009, ramachandran gave the following explanation of his theory: ""... i also speculated that these neurons can not only help simulate other peoples behavior but can be turned inward landmark book a theory of objective self awareness, states that when we focus our attention on ourselves, we evaluate and compare our current behavior to our internal standards and values. this elicits a state of objective self-awareness. we become self-conscious as objective evaluators of ourselves. however self-awareness is not to be confused with self-consciousness. various emotional states are intensified by self-awareness. however, some people may seek to increase their self-awareness through these outlets. people are more likely to align their behavior with their standards when made self-aware. people will be negatively affected if they dont live up to their personal standards. various environmental cues and situations induce awareness of the self, such as mirrors, an audience, or being videotaped or recorded. these cues also increase accuracy of personal memory. in one of andreas demetrious neo-piagetian theories of cognitive development, self-awareness develops systematically from birth through the life span and it is a major factor for the development of general inferential processes. moreover, a series of recent studies showed that self-awareness about cognitive processes participates in general intelligence on a par with processing efficiency functions, such as working memory, processing speed, and reasoning. albert banduras theory of self-efficacy builds on our varying degrees of self-awareness.  it is ""the belief in ones capabilities to organize and execute the courses of action required to manage prospective situations."" a persons belief in their ability to succeed sets the stage to how they think, behave and feel. someone with a strong self-efficacy, for example, views challenges as mere tasks that must be overcome, and are not easily discouraged by setbacks. they are aware of their flaws and abilities and choose to utilize these qualities to the best of their ability. someone with a weak sense of self-efficacy evades challenges and quickly feels discouraged by setbacks. they may not be aware of these negative reactions, and therefore do not always change their attitude. this concept is central to banduras social cognitive theory, ""which emphasizes the role of observational learning, social experience, and reciprocal determinism in the development of personality.""individuals become conscious of themselves through the development of self-awareness. this particular type of self-development pertains to becoming conscious of ones own body and mental state of mind including thoughts, actions, ideas, feelings and interactions with others. ""self-awareness does not occur suddenly through one particular behavior: it develops gradually through a succession of different behaviors all of which relate to the self."" the monitoring of ones mental states is called metacognition and it is considered to be an indicator that there is some concept of the self.  it is developed through an early sense of non-self components using sensory and memory sources. in developing self4 months, they will discover themselves and recognize their own reflection in the mirror, however research has found that this age varies widely with differing socioeconomic levels and differences relating to culture and parenting. they begin to acknowledge the fact that the image in front of them, who happens to be them, moves; indicating that they appreciate and can consider the relationship between cause and effect that is happening. by the age of 24 months the toddler will observe and relate their own actions to those actions of other people and the surrounding environment. once an infant has gotten a lot of experience, and time, in front of a mirror, it is only then that they are able to recognize themselves in the reflection, and understand that it is them. for example, in a study, an experimenter took a red marker and put a fairly large red dot  there is somewhat of the same thing called the mirror-self recognition task, and it has been used as a research tool for numerous years, and has given, and lead to, key foundations of the infants sense/awareness of self.  for example, ""for piaget, the objectification of the bodily self occurs as the infant becomes able to represent the bodys spatial and causal relationship with the external world  facial recognition places a big pivotal point in their development of self-awareness. by 18 months, the infant can communicate their name to others, and upon being shown a picture they are in, they can identify themselves. by two years old, they also usually acquire gender category and age categories, saying things such as ""i am a girl, not a boy"" and ""i am a baby or child, not a grownup"". evidently, it is not at the level of an adult or an adolescent, but as an infant moves to middle childhood and onwards to adolescence, they develop a higher level of self-awareness and self-description.as infants develop their senses, using multiple senses of in order to recognize what is around them, infants can become affected by something known as ""facial multi stimulation"". in one experiment by filippetti, farroni, and johnson, an infant of around five months in age is given what is known as an nini5% diagnosed with aspergers syndrome show average to good cognitive functioning. when we compare our own behavior to the morals and values that we were taught, we can focus more attention on ourselves which increases self-awareness. to understand the many effects of autism spectrum disorders on those afflicted have led many scientists to theorize what level of self-awareness occurs and in what degree. research found that asd can be associated with intellectual disability and difficulties in motor coordination and attention. it can also result in physical health issues as well, such as sleep and gastrointestinal disturbances. as a result of all those problems, individuals are literally unaware of themselves. it is well known that children suffering from varying degrees of autism struggle in social situations. scientists at the university of cambridge have produced evidence that self-awareness is a main problem for people with asd. researchers used functional magnetic resonance scans a study out of stanford university has tried to map out brain circuits with understanding self-awareness in autism spectrum disorders. this study suggests that self-awareness is primarily lacking in social situations but when in private they are more self-aware and present. it is in the company of others while engaging in interpersonal interaction that the self-awareness mechanism seems to fail. higher functioning individuals on the asd scale have reported that they are more self-aware when alone unless they are in sensory overload or immediately following social exposure. self-awareness dissipates when an autistic is faced with a demanding social situation. this theory suggests that this happens due to the behavioral inhibitory system which is responsible for self-preservation. this is the system that prevents human from self-harm like jumping out of a speeding bus or putting our hand on a hot stove. once a dangerous situation is perceived then the behavioral inhibitory system kicks in and restrains our activities. ""for individuals with asd, this inhibitory mechanism is so powerful, it operates on the least possible trigger and shows an over sensitivity to impending danger and possible threats. some of these dangers may be perceived as being in the presence of strangers, or a loud noise from a radio. in these situations self-awareness can be compromised due to the desire of self preservation, which trumps social composure and proper interaction.the hobson hypothesis reports that autism begins in infancy due to the lack of cognitive and linguistic engagement which in turn results in impaired reflective self-awareness. in this study ten children with aspergers syndrome were examined using the self-understanding interview.  this interview was created by damon and hart and focuses on seven core areas or schemas that measure the capacity to think in increasingly difficult levels. this interview will estimate the level of self understanding present. ""the study showed that the asperger group demonstrated impairment in the self-as-object and self-as-subject domains of the self-understanding interview, which supported hobsons concept of an impaired capacity for self-awareness and self-reflection in people with asd."" self-understanding is a self description in an individuals past, present and future. without self-understanding it is reported that self-awareness is lacking in people with asd.joint attention  ja strategies were first used to directly teach about reflected mirror images and how they relate to their reflected image. mirror self awareness development  mirror understanding and its relation to the development of self leads to measurable increases in self-awareness in those with asd. it also proves to be a highly engaging and highly preferred tool in understanding the developmental stages of self- awareness.there have been many different theories and studies done on what degree of self-awareness is displayed among people with autism spectrum disorder. scientists have done research about the various parts of the brain associated with understanding self and self-awareness. studies have shown evidence of areas of the brain that are impacted by asd. other theories suggest that helping an individual learn more about themselves through joint activities, such as the mirror self awareness development may help teach positive self-awareness and growth. in helping to build self-awareness it is also possible to build self-esteem and self acceptance. this in turn can help to allow the individual with asd to relate better to their environment and have better social interactions with others.schizophrenia is a chronic psychiatric illness characterized by excessive dopamine activity in the mesolimbic tract and insufficient dopamine activity in the mesocortical tract leading to symptoms of psychosis along with poor cognition in socialization. under the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, people with schizophrenia have a combination of positive, negative and psychomotor symptoms. these cognitive disturbances involve rare beliefs and/or thoughts of a distorted reality that creates an abnormal pattern of functioning for the patient. the cause of schizophrenia has a substantial genetic component involving many genes. while the heritability of schizophrenia has been found to be around 80%, only about 60% of sufferers report a positive family history of the disorder, and ultimately the cause is thought to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors. it is believed that the experience of stressful life events is an environmental factor that can trigger the onset of schizophrenia in individuals who already are at risk from genetics and age. the level of self-awareness among patients with schizophrenia is a heavily studied topic.schizophrenia as a disease state is characterized by severe cognitive dysfunction and it is uncertain to what extent patients are aware of this deficiency. medalia and lim  results from this study  the study suggests a correlation exists between patient insight, compliance, and disease progression. investigators assess insight of illness was assessed via scale to assess unawareness of mental disorder and was used along with rating of psychopathology, course of illness, and compliance with treatments in a sample of 43 patients. patients with poor insight are less likely to be compliant with treatment and are more likely to have a poorer prognosis. patients with hallucinations sometimes experience positive symptoms, which can include delusions of reference, thought insertion/withdrawal, thought broadcast, delusions of persecution, grandiosity, and many more. these psychoses skew the patients perspectives of reality in ways in which they truly believe are really happening. for instance, a patient that is experiencing delusions of reference may believe while watching the weather forecast that when the weatherman says it will rain, he is really sending a message to the patient in which rain symbolizes a specific warning completely irrelevant to what the weather is. another example would be thought broadcast, which is when a patient believes that everyone can hear their thoughts. these positive symptoms sometimes are so severe to where the schizophrenic believes that something is crawling on them or smelling something that is not there in reality. these strong hallucinations are intense and difficult to convince the patient that they do not exist outside of their cognitive beliefs, making it extremely difficult for a patient to understand and become self-aware that what they are experiencing is in fact not there.furthermore, a study by bedford and davis  this disorder is a difficult one to diagnose, as self-awareness changes with mood. ""for instance, what might appear to you as confidence and clever ideas for a new business venture might be a pattern of grandiose thinking and manic behavior"". issues occur between understanding irrationality in a mood swing and being completely wrapped in a manic episode, rationalizing that the exhibited behaviors are normal.it is important to be able to distinguish what are symptoms of bipolar disorder and what is not. a study done by mathew et al. was done with the aim of ""examining the perceptions of illness in self and among other patients with bipolar disorder in remission"".the study took place at the department of psychiatry, christian medical college, vellore, india, which is a centre that specializes in the ""management of patients with mental and behavioural disorders"". eighty two patients  and were put through a variety of baseline assessments before beginning the study. these baseline assessments included using a vignette, which was then used as an assessment tool during their follow-up. patients were then randomly divided into two groups, one who would be following a ""structured educational intervention programme""  the mcnemar test was then used to compare the patients perspective of the illness versus their explanation of the illness. the results of the study show that the beliefs that patients associated with their illness corresponds with the possible causes of the disorder, whereas ""studies done among patients during periods of active psychosis have recorded disagreement between their assessments of their own illness"". this ties in to how difficult self-awareness is within people who suffer from bipolar disorder.although this study was done on a population that were in remission from the disease, the distinction between patients during ""active psychosis"" versus those in remission shows the evolution of their self-awareness throughout their journey to recovery.self-discrimination in plants is found within their roots, tendrils and flowers that avoid themselves but not others in their environment.self-awareness in plants is a fringe topic in the field of self-awareness, and is researched predominantly by botanists. the claim that plants are capable of perceiving self lies in the evidence found that plants will not reproduce with themselves due to a gene selecting mechanism.  in addition, vining plants have been shown to avoid coiling around themselves, due to chemical receptors in the plants tendrils. unique to plants, awareness of self means that the plant can recognise self, whereas all other known conceptions of self-awareness is the ability to recognise what is not self.research by june b. nasrallah discovered that the plants pollination mechanism also serves as a mechanism against self-reproduction, which lays out the foundation of scientific evidence that plants could be considered as self-aware organisms. the si the research by yuya fukano and akira yamawo provides a link between self-discrimination in vining plants and amongst other classifications where the mechanism discovery has already been established. it also contributes to the general foundation of evidence of self-discrimination mechanisms in plants. the article makes the claim that the biological self-discrimination mechanism that is present in both flowering plants and ascidians, are also present in vining plants.  they tested this hypothesis by doing touch tests with self neighbouring and non-self neighbouring pairs of plants. the test was performed by placing the sets of plants close enough for their tendrils to interact with one-another. evidence of self-discrimination in above-ground plants is demonstrated in the results of the touch testing, which showed that in cases of connected self plants, severed self plants and non-self plants, the rate of tendril activity and likeliness to coil was higher among separated plants than those attached via rhizomes.theater also concerns itself with other awareness besides self-awareness. there is a possible correlation between the experience of the theater audience and individual self-awareness. as actors and audiences must not ""break"" the fourth wall in order to maintain context, so individuals must not be aware of the artificial, or the constructed perception of his or her reality. this suggests that both self-awareness and the social constructs applied to others are artificial continuums just as theater is. theatrical efforts such as six characters in search of an author, or the wonderful wizard of oz, construct yet another layer of the fourth wall, but they do not destroy the primary illusion. refer to erving goffmans frame analysis: an essay on the organization of experience.in science fiction, self-awareness describes an essential human property that often  the words ""sentience"", ""sapience"" and ""consciousness"" are used in similar ways in science fiction.in order to be ""self-aware,"" robots can use internal models to simulate their own actions.",1,0
"sake, also spelled sak0% abv  can refer to any alcoholic drink, while the beverage called ""sake"" in english is usually termed nihonshu  alcoholic beverages  sake production was a government monopoly for a long time, but in the 10th century, temples and shrines began to brew sake, and they became the main centers of production for the next 500 years. the tamon-in diary, written by abbots of tamon-in  in the 16th century, the technique of distillation was introduced into the kyushu district from ryukyu. the brewing of sh0th century, sake-brewing technology advanced. the government opened the sake-brewing research institute in 1904, and in 1907 the first government-run sake-tasting competition was held. yeast strains specifically selected for their brewing properties were isolated and enamel-coated steel tanks arrived. the government started hailing the use of enamel tanks as easy to clean, lasting forever, and being devoid of bacterial problems. in japan, sake has long been taxed by the national government. in 1898, this tax brought in about 0% of government income.when world war ii brought rice shortages, the sake-brewing industry was hampered as the government discouraged the use of rice for brewing. as early as the late 17th century, it had been discovered that small amounts of alcohol could be added to sake before pressing to extract aromas and flavors from the rice solids. during the war, pure alcohol and glucose were added to small quantities of rice mash, increasing the yield by as much as four times. 75% of todays sake is made using this technique. there were a few breweries producing ""sake"" that contained no rice at all. the quality of sake during this time varied greatly.postwar, breweries slowly recovered, and the quality of sake gradually increased. new players on the scene29 breweries nationwide in fiscal 1975, the number had fallen to 1,845 in 2007.the oldest known sake brewery is from the 15th century near an area that was owned by tenry or miki (.in a ceremony called kagami biraki, wooden casks of sake are opened with mallets during shinto festivals, weddings, store openings, sports and election victories, and other celebrations. this sake, called iwai-zake (""celebration sake"", is served freely to all to spread good fortune.at the new year many japanese people drink a special sake called toso.  toso is a sort of iwai-zake made by soaking tososan, a chinese powdered medicine, overnight in sake. even children sip a portion. in some regions, the first sips of toso are taken in order of age, from the youngest to the eldest.a cask of sake before the kagami birakidecorative sake containers in a nakatsugawa shop",1,0
"rice is the seed of the grass species oryza glaberrima since sizable portions of sugarcane and maize crops are used for purposes other than human consumption, rice is the most important grain with regard to human nutrition and caloric intake, providing more than one-fifth of the calories consumed worldwide by humans. there are many varieties of rice and culinary preferences tend to vary regionally.rice, a monocot, is normally grown as an annual plant, although in tropical areas it can survive as a perennial and can produce a ratoon crop for up to 30 years. rice cultivation is well-suited to countries and regions with low labor costs and high rainfall, as it is labor-intensive to cultivate and requires ample water. however, rice can be grown practically anywhere, even on a steep hill or mountain area with the use of water-controlling terrace systems. although its parent species are native to asia and certain parts of africa, centuries of trade and exportation have made it commonplace in many cultures worldwide.the traditional method for cultivating rice is flooding the fields while, or after, setting the young seedlings. this simple method requires sound irrigation planning but reduces the growth of less robust weed and pest plants that have no submerged growth state, and deters vermin. while flooding is not mandatory for the cultivation of rice, all other methods of irrigation require higher effort in weed and pest control during growth periods and a different approach for fertilizing the soil.the name wild rice is usually used for species of the genera zizania and porteresia, both wild and domesticated, although the term may also be used for primitive or uncultivated varieties of oryza.the rice plant can grow to 10 hours to stimulate germination. this process, called germinated brown rice  activates enzymes and enhances amino acids including gamma-aminobutyric acid to improve the nutritional value of brown rice. this method is a result of research carried out for the united nations international year of rice.rice is cooked by boiling or steaming, and absorbs water during cooking. with the absorption method, rice may be cooked in a volume of water equal to the volume of dry rice plus any evaporation losses. with the rapid-boil method, rice may be cooked in a large quantity of water which is drained before serving. rapid-boil preparation is not desirable with enriched rice, as much of the enrichment additives are lost when the water is discarded. electric rice cookers, popular in asia and latin america, simplify the process of cooking rice. rice cooked unenriched long-grain white rice is composed of 68% water, 28% carbohydrates, 3% protein, and negligible fat  it also depends on nutrient quality of the soil rice is grown in, whether and how the rice is polished or processed, the manner it is enriched, and how it is prepared before consumption.a 2018 world health organization  a systematic review of clinical research on the efficacy of rice fortification showed the strategy had the main effect of reducing the risk of iron deficiency by 35% and increasing blood levels of hemoglobin. the guideline established a major recommendation: ""fortification of rice with iron is recommended as a public health strategy to improve the iron status of populations, in settings where rice is a staple food.""rice grown experimentally under elevated carbon dioxide levels, similar to those predicted for the year 2100 as a result of human activity, had less iron, zinc, and protein, as well as lower levels of thiamin, riboflavin, folic acid, and pantothenic acid.a  raw yellow dent cornb  raw unenriched long-grain white ricec  raw hard red winter wheatd  raw potato with flesh and skine  raw

administration  while growing, rice plants tend to absorb arsenic more readily than other food crops, requiring expanded testing by the fda for possible arsenic-related risks associated with rice consumption in the united states. in april 2016, the fda proposed a limit of 100 parts per billion  for water contamination by arsenic, the united states environmental protection agency has set a lower standard of 10 ppb.arsenic is a group 1 carcinogen. the amount of arsenic in rice varies widely with the greatest concentration in brown rice and rice grown on land formerly used to grow cotton, such as in arkansas, louisiana, missouri, and texas. white rice grown in arkansas, louisiana, missouri, and texas, which account collectively for 76 percent of american-produced rice, had higher levels of arsenic than other regions of the world studied, possibly because of past use of arsenic-based pesticides to control cotton weevils. jasmine rice from thailand and basmati rice from pakistan and india contain the least arsenic among rice varieties in one study. china has set a limit of 150 ppb for arsenic in rice.cooked rice can contain bacillus cereus spores, which produce an emetic toxin when left at 4011 that showed that all forms of asian rice, both indica and japonica, sprang from a single domestication event that occurred 13,500 to 8,200 years ago in china from the wild rice oryza rufipogon. a more recent population genomic study indicates that japonica was domesticated first, and that indica rice arose when japonica arrived in india about ~4,500 years ago and hybridized with an undomesticated proto-indica or wild o. nivara.there are two most likely centers of domestication for rice as well as the development of the wetland agriculture technology. the first, and most likely, is in the lower yangtze river, believed to be the homelands of the pre-austronesians and possibly also the kra-dai, and associated with the kauhuqiao, hemudu, majiabang, songze, liangzhu, and maqiao cultures. it is characterized by pre-austronesian features, including stilt houses, jade carving, and boat technologies. their diet were also supplemented by acorns, water chestnuts, foxnuts, and pig domestication.the second is in the middle yangtze river, believed to be the homelands of the early hmong-mien-speakers and associated with the pengtoushan, nanmuyuan, liulinxi, daxi, qujialing, and shijiahe cultures. both of these regions were heavily populated and had regular trade contacts with each other, as well as with early austroasiatic speakers to the west, and early kra-dai speakers to the south, facilitating the spread of rice cultivation throughout southern china.rice was gradually introduced north into early sino-tibetan yangshao and dawenkou culture millet farmers, either via contact with the daxi culture or the majiabang-hemudu culture. by around 4000 to 3800 bc, they were a regular secondary crop among southernmost sino-tibetan cultures. it did not replace millet, largely because of different environment conditions in northern china, but it was cultivated alongside millet in the southern boundaries of the millet-farming regions. conversely, millet was also introduced into rice-farming regions.by the late neolithic liangzhu and shijiahe declined abruptly in the terminal neolithic  a genomic study also indicates that at around this time, a global cooling event genomic studies suggests that indica rice arrives in china from india between 2,000 and 1,400 years ago.the spread of japonica rice cultivation to southeast asia started with the migrations of the austronesian dapenkeng culture into taiwan between 3500 and 2000 bc  a multidisciplinary study using rice genome sequences indicate that tropical japonica rice was pushed southwards from china after a global cooling event from about 2000 to 1500 bc, the austronesian expansion began, with settlers from taiwan moving south to colonize luzon in the philippines, bringing rice cultivation technologies with them. from luzon, austronesians rapidly colonized the rest of island southeast asia, moving westwards to borneo, the malay peninsula and sumatra; and southwards to sulawesi and java. by 500 bc, there is evidence of intensive wetland rice agriculture already established in java and bali, especially near very fertile volcanic islands.however, rice rice, along with other southeast asian food plants, were also later introduced to madagascar, the comoros, and the coast of east africa by around the 1st millennium ad by austronesian settlers from the greater sunda islands.much later austronesian voyages from island southeast asia succeeded in bringing rice to guam during the latte period within mainland southeast asia, rice was presumably spread through river trade between the early hmong-mien-speakers of the middle yangtze basin and the early kra-dai-speakers of the pearl river and red river basins, as well as the early austroasiatic-speakers of the mekong river basin. evidence for rice cultivation in these regions, dates to slightly later than the dapenkeng settlement of taiwan, at around 3000 bc. southward migrations of the austroasiatic and kra-dai-speakers introduced it into mainland southeast asia. the earliest evidence of rice cultivation in mainland southeast asia come from the ban chiang site in northern thailand  a genomic study indicates that rice diversified into maritime southeast asia between 2,500 and 1,500 years ago.mainstream archaeological evidence derived from palaeoethnobotanical investigations indicate dry-land rice was introduced to korea and japan sometime between 3500 and 1200 bc. the cultivation of rice then occurred on a small scale, fields were impermanent plots, and evidence shows that in some cases domesticated and wild grains were planted together. the technological, subsistence, and social impact of rice and grain cultivation is not evident in archaeological data until after 1500000 bc.rice was cultivated in the indus valley civilization  agricultural activity during the second millennium bc included rice cultivation in the kashmir and harrappan regions. mixed farming was the basis of indus valley economy.o. sativa was recovered from a grave at susa in iran although oryza sativa was domesticated in asia, the now less popular oryza glaberrima rice was independently domesticated in africa 3,000 to 3,500 years ago. between 1500 and 800 bc, oryza glaberrima propagated from its original centre, the niger river delta, and extended to senegal. however, it never developed far from its original region. its cultivation even declined in favour of the asian species, which was introduced to east africa early in the common era and spread westward.rice was known to the classical world, being imported from egypt, and perhaps west asia. it was known to greece the moors brought asiatic rice to the iberian peninsula in the 10th century. records indicate it was grown in valencia and majorca. in majorca, rice cultivation seems to have stopped after the christian conquest, although historians are not certain.muslims also brought rice to sicily with cultivation starting in the 9th century, where it was an important crop long before it is noted in the plain of pisa after the 15th century, rice spread throughout italy and then france, later propagating to all the continents during the age of european exploration.in russia, a short-grain, starchy rice similar to the italian varieties, has been grown in the krasnodar krai, and known in russia as ""kuban rice"" or ""krasnodar rice"". in the russian far east several japonica cultivars are grown in primorye around the khanka lake. increasing scale of rice production in the region has recently brought criticism towards growers alleged bad practices in regards to the environment.the origin of oryza sativa rice domestication has been a subject of much debate among those who study crop history and anthropology - whether rice originated in india or china. asian rice, oryza sativa, is one of oldest crop species. it has tens of thousands of varieties and two major subspecies, japonica and indica. archeologists focusing on east and southeast asia argue that rice farming began in south-central china along the yangtze river and spread to korea and japan from there south and northeast. archaeologists working in india argue that rice cultivation started in the valley of the ganges river and indus valley, by peoples unconnected to those of the yangzte.a 2012 study, through a map of genome variation in modern wild rice populations, indicated that the domestication of rice probably occurred around the central pearl river valley region of southern china, in contradiction to archaeological evidence. however, the study is based on modern distribution maps of wild rice populations which are potentially misleading due to drastic climatic changes that happened during the end of the last glacial period, ca. 12,000 years ago. human activity over thousands of years has also removed populations of wild rice from their previous ranges. based on chinese texts, there were populations of wild rice along the yangtze basin in c. ad 1,000 that have recently become extinct.an older theory, based on one chloroplast and two nuclear gene regions, londo et al. in 2003, korean archaeologists alleged they discovered burnt grains of domesticated rice in soro-ri, korea, which dated to 13,0000 million households. the importance of rice in indonesian culture is demonstrated through the reverence of dewi sri, the rice goddess of ancient java and bali.evidence of wild rice on the island of sulawesi dates from 3000 bc. historic written evidence for the earliest cultivation, however, comes from eighth century stone inscriptions from the central island of java, which show kings levied taxes in rice. the images of rice cultivation, rice barn, and mouse pest investing a rice field is evident in karmawibhangga bas-reliefs of borobudur. divisions of labour between men, women, and animals that are still in place in indonesian rice cultivation, were carved into relief friezes on the ninth century prambanan temples in central java: a water buffalo attached to a plough; women planting seedlings and pounding grain; and a man carrying sheaves of rice on each end of a pole across his shoulders rice is the major food amongst all the ethnic groups in nepal. in the terai, most rice varieties are cultivated during the rainy season. the principal rice growing season, known as ""berna-bue charne"", is from june to july when water is sufficient for only a part of the fields; the subsidiary season, known as ""ropai, is from april to september, when there is usually enough water to sustain the cultivation of all rice fields. farmers use irrigation channels throughout the cultivation seasons.the banaue rice terraces  it is commonly thought that the terraces were built with minimal equipment, largely by hand. the terraces are located approximately 1,500 meters  the terraces are found in the province of ifugao and the ifugao people have been its caretakers. ifugao culture revolves around rice and the culture displays an elaborate array of celebrations linked with agricultural rites from rice cultivation to rice consumption. the harvest season generally calls for thanksgiving feasts, while the concluding harvest rites called tango or tungul  been known to culture edible shells, fruit trees, and other vegetables which have been exhibited among ifugaos for generations. the building of the rice terraces consists of blanketing walls with stones and earth which are designed to draw water from a main irrigation canal above the terrace clusters. indigenous rice terracing technologies have been identified with the ifugaos rice terraces such as their knowledge of water irrigation, stonework, earthwork and terrace maintenance. as their source of life and art, the rice terraces have sustained and shaped the lives of the community members.rice is the staple food amongst all the ethnic groups in sri lanka. agriculture in sri lanka mainly depends on the rice cultivation. rice production is acutely dependent on rainfall and government supply necessity of water through irrigation channels throughout the cultivation seasons. the principal cultivation season, known as ""maha"", is from october to march and the subsidiary cultivation season, known as ""yala"", is from april to september. during maha season, there is usually enough water to sustain the cultivation of all rice fields, nevertheless in yala season there is only enough water for cultivation of half of the land extent. traditional rice varieties are now making a comeback with the recent interest in green foods.rice is the main export of thailand, especially white jasmine rice 105  thailand has a large number of rice varieties, 3,500 kinds with different characters, and five kinds of wild rice cultivates. in each region of the country there are different rice seed types. their use depends on weather, atmosphere, and topography.the northern region has both low lands and high lands. the farmers usual crop is non-glutinous rice such as niew sun pah tong rice. this rice is naturally protected from leaf disease, and its paddy  the northeastern region is a large area where farmers can cultivate about 36 million square meters of rice. although most of it is plains and dry areas, white jasmine rice 1050s at veracruz, and the portuguese and their african slaves introduced it at about the same time to colonial brazil. recent scholarship suggests that enslaved africans played an active role in the establishment of rice in the new world and that african rice was an important crop from an early period. varieties of rice and bean dishes that were a staple dish along the peoples of west africa remained a staple among their descendants subjected to slavery in the spanish new world colonies, brazil and elsewhere in the americas.in 1694, rice arrived in south carolina, probably originating from madagascar. tradition the mastery of rice farming was a challenge for the english and other european settlers who were unfamiliar with the crop. native americans, who mostly gathered wild rice, were also inexperienced with rice cultivation. however, within the first fifty years of settlement rice became the dominant crop in south carolina.in the united states, colonial south carolina and georgia grew and amassed great wealth from the slave labor obtained from the senegambia area of west africa and from coastal sierra leone. at the port of charleston, through which 40% of all american slave imports passed, slaves from this region of africa brought the highest prices due to their prior knowledge of rice culture, which was put to use on the many rice plantations around georgetown, charleston, and savannah.from the enslaved africans, plantation owners learned how to dyke the marshes and periodically flood the fields. at first the rice was laboriously milled by hand using large mortars and pestles made of wood, then winnowed in sweetgrass baskets in the southern united states, rice has been grown in southern arkansas, louisiana, and east texas since the mid-19th century. many cajun farmers grew rice in wet marshes and low-lying prairies where they could also farm crayfish when the fields were flooded. in recent years rice production has risen in north america, especially in the mississippi embayment in the states of arkansas and mississippi  by 2006, california produced the second-largest rice crop in the united states, after arkansas, with production concentrated in six counties north of sacramento. unlike the arkansas006 crop year, rice production in the u.s. is valued at $1.88% of world rice trade. the majority of domestic utilization of u.s. rice is direct food use rice was one of the earliest crops planted in australia by british settlers, who had experience with rice plantations in the americas and india.although attempts to grow rice in the well-watered north of australia have been made for many years, they have consistently failed because of inherent iron and manganese toxicities in the soils and destruction by pests.in the 1920s, it was seen as a possible irrigation crop on soils within the murray017, world production of paddy rice was 769.7 million tonnes, led by china and india with a combined 49% of this total. other major producers were indonesia, bangladesh and vietnam. the five major producers accounted for 72% of total production, while the top fifteen producers accounted for 91% of total world production in 2017 rice is a major food staple and a mainstay for the rural population and their food security. it is mainly cultivated by small farmers in holdings of less than one hectare. rice is also a wage commodity for workers in the cash crop or non-agricultural sectors. rice is vital for the nutrition of much of the population in asia, as well as in latin america and the caribbean and in africa; it is central to the food security of over half the world population.many rice grain producing countries have significant losses post-harvest at the farm and because of poor roads, inadequate storage technologies, inefficient supply chains and farmers inability to bring the produce into retail markets dominated by small shopkeepers. a world bank 6% of rice is lost in developing nations, on average, every year, because of post-harvest problems and poor infrastructure. some sources claim the post-harvest losses exceed 40%. not only do these losses reduce food security in the world, the study claims that farmers in developing countries such as china, india and others lose approximately us$89 billion of income in preventable post-harvest farm losses, poor transport, the lack of proper storage and retail. one study claims that if these post-harvest grain losses could be eliminated with better infrastructure and retail network, in india alone enough food would be saved every year to feed 70 to 100 million people.the seeds of the rice plant are first milled using a rice huller to remove the chaff  is subjected to a steaming or parboiling process while still a brown rice grain. the parboil process causes a gelatinisation of the starch in the grains. the grains become less brittle, and the color of the milled grain changes from white to yellow. the rice is then dried, and can then be milled as usual or used as brown rice. milled parboiled rice is nutritionally superior to standard milled rice, because the process causes nutrients from the outer husk  rice can be made into various types of noodles. raw, wild, or brown rice may also be consumed by raw-foodist or fruitarians if soaked and sprouted rice, like other cereal grains, can be puffed world trade figures are very different from those for production, as less than 8% of rice produced is traded internationally. in economic terms, the global rice trade was a small fraction of 1% of world mercantile trade. many countries consider rice as a strategic food staple, and various governments subject its trade to a wide range of controls and interventions.developing countries are the main players in the world rice trade, accounting for 83% of exports and 85% of imports. while there are numerous importers of rice, the exporters of rice are limited. just five countries002. however, this ranking has been rapidly changing in recent years. in 2010, the three largest exporters of rice, in decreasing order of quantity exported were thailand, vietnam and india. by 2012, india became the largest exporter of rice with a 100% increase in its exports on year-to-year basis, and thailand slipped to third position. together, thailand, vietnam and india accounted for nearly 70% of the world rice exports.the primary variety exported by thailand and vietnam were jasmine rice, while exports from india included aromatic basmati variety. china, an exporter of rice in early 2000s, was a net importer of rice in 2010 and will become the largest net importer, surpassing nigeria, in 2013. according to a usda report, the worlds largest exporters of rice in 2012 were india major importers usually include nigeria, indonesia, bangladesh, saudi arabia, iran, iraq, malaysia, the philippines, brazil and some african and persian gulf countries. in common with other west african countries, nigeria is actively promoting domestic production. however, its very heavy import duties  parboiled rice is particularly popular in nigeria. although china and india are the two largest producers of rice in the world, both countries consume the majority of the rice produced domestically, leaving little to be traded internationally.the average world yield for rice was 4.3 tonnes per hectare, in 2010.australian rice farms were the most productive in 2010, with a nationwide average of 10.8 tonnes per hectare.yuan longping of china national hybrid rice research and development center, china, set a world record for rice yield in 2010 at 19 tonnes per hectare on a demonstration plot. in 2011, this record was surpassed by an indian farmer, sumant kumar, with 22.4 tonnes per hectare in bihar. both these farmers claim to have employed newly developed rice breeds and system of rice intensification in late 2007 to may 2008, the price of grains rose greatly due to droughts in major producing countries  over the period of 2007 to 2013, the chinese government has substantially increased the price it pays domestic farmers for their rice, rising to us$500 per metric ton by 2013. the 2013 price of rice originating from other southeast asian countries was a comparably low us$350 per metric ton.on april 30, 2008, thailand announced plans for the creation of the organisation of rice exporting countries  however, as of mid-2011 little progress had been made to achieve this.as of 2013, world food consumption of rice was 565.6002, per capita consumption of rice increased by 40%.rice is the most important crop in asia. in cambodia, for example, 90% of the total agricultural area is used for rice production.u.s. rice consumption has risen sharply over the past 25 years, fueled in part by commercial applications such as beer production. almost one in five adult americans now report eating at least half a serving of white or brown rice per day.rice cultivation on wetland rice fields is thought to be responsible for 11% of the anthropogenic methane emissions. rice requires slightly more water to produce than other grains. rice production uses almost a third of earths fresh water.long-term flooding of rice fields cuts the soil off from atmospheric oxygen and causes anaerobic fermentation of organic matter in the soil. methane production from rice cultivation contributes ~1.5% of anthropogenic greenhouse gases. methane is twenty times more potent a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide.a 2010 study found that, as a result of rising temperatures and decreasing solar radiation during the later years of the 20th century, the rice yield growth rate has decreased in many parts of asia, compared to what would have been observed had the temperature and solar radiation trends not occurred. the yield growth rate had fallen 100% at some locations. the study was based on records from 227 farms in thailand, vietnam, nepal, india, china, bangladesh, and pakistan. the mechanism of this falling yield was not clear, but might involve increased respiration during warm nights, which expends energy without being able to photosynthesize.rice requires high temperature above 20 to the leaf canopy but strong wind causes severe damage and may lead to sterility rice pests are any organisms or microbes with the potential to reduce the yield or value of the rice crop  rice pests include weeds, pathogens, insects, nematode, rodents, and birds. a variety of factors can contribute to pest outbreaks, including climatic factors, improper irrigation, the overuse of insecticides and high rates of nitrogen fertilizer application. weather conditions also contribute to pest outbreaks. for example, rice gall midge and army worm outbreaks tend to follow periods of high rainfall early in the wet season, while thrips outbreaks are associated with drought.major rice insect pests include: the brown planthopper  several species of stemborers003, respectively, which discouraged insecticide misuse and smarter pest management in vietnam.rice plants produce their own chemical defenses to protect themselves from pest attacks. some synthetic chemicals, such as the herbicide 2,4-d, cause the plant to increase the production of certain defensive chemicals and thereby increase the plants resistance to some types of pests. conversely, other chemicals, such as the insecticide imidacloprid, can induce changes in the gene expression of the rice that cause the plant to become more susceptible to attacks by certain types of pests. 5-alkylresorcinols are chemicals that can also be found in rice.botanicals, so-called ""natural pesticides"", are used by some farmers in an attempt to control rice pests. botanicals include extracts of leaves, or a mulch of the leaves themselves. some upland rice farmers in cambodia spread chopped leaves of the bitter bush among rice cultivars, there are differences in the responses to, and recovery from, pest damage. many rice varieties have been selected for resistance to insect pests. therefore, particular cultivars are recommended for areas prone to certain pest problems. the genetically based ability of a rice variety to withstand pest attacks is called resistance. three main types of plant resistance to pests are recognized as nonpreference, antibiosis, and tolerance. nonpreference over time, the use of pest-resistant rice varieties selects for pests that are able to overcome these mechanisms of resistance. when a rice variety is no longer able to resist pest infestations, resistance is said to have broken down. rice varieties that can be widely grown for many years in the presence of pests and retain their ability to withstand the pests are said to have durable resistance. mutants of popular rice varieties are regularly screened by plant breeders to discover new sources of durable resistance.rice is parasitized by the weed eudicot striga hermonthica, which is of local importance for this crop.while most rice is bred for crop quality and productivity, there are varieties selected for characteristics such as texture, smell, and firmness. there are four major categories of rice worldwide: indica, japonica, aromatic and glutinous. the different varieties of rice are not considered interchangeable, either in food preparation or agriculture, so as a result, each major variety is a completely separate market from other varieties. it is common for one variety of rice to rise in price while another one drops in price.rice cultivars also fall into groups according to environmental conditions, season of planting, and season of harvest, called ecotypes. some major groups are the japan-type  cultivars exist that are adapted to deep flooding, and these are generally called ""floating rice"".the largest collection of rice cultivars is at the international rice research institute in the philippines, with over 100,000 rice accessions held in the international rice genebank. rice cultivars are often classified by their grain shapes and texture. for example, thai jasmine rice is long-grain and relatively less sticky, as some long-grain rice contains less amylopectin than short-grain cultivars. chinese restaurants often serve long-grain as plain unseasoned steamed rice though short-grain rice is common as well. japanese mochi rice and chinese sticky rice are short-grain. chinese people use sticky rice which is properly known as ""glutinous rice"" on december 16, 2002, the un general assembly declared the year 2004 the international year of rice. the declaration was sponsored by more than 40 countries.the high-yielding varieties are a group of crops created intentionally during the green revolution to increase global food production. this project enabled labor markets in asia to shift away from agriculture, and into industrial sectors. the first ""rice car"", ir8 was produced in 1966 at the international rice research institute which is based in the philippines at the university of the philippines los ba0 million hectares. standard rice varieties cannot withstand stagnant flooding of more than about a week, mainly as it disallows the plant access to necessary requirements such as sunlight and essential gas exchanges, inevitably leading to plants being unable to recover.in the past, this has led to massive losses in yields, such as in the philippines, where in 2006, rice crops worth $653013 the japanese national institute for agrobiological sciences led a team which successfully inserted the deeper rooting 1  this facilitates an improved ability for the rice plant to derive its required nutrients in times of drought via accessing deeper layers of soil, a feature demonstrated by trials which saw the ir64 + dro1 rice yields drop by 10% under moderate drought conditions, compared to 60% for the unmodified ir64 variety.soil salinity poses a major threat to rice crop productivity, particularly along low-lying coastal areas during the dry season. for example, roughly 1 million hectares of the coastal areas of bangladesh are affected by saline soils. these high concentrations of salt can severely affect rice plants normal physiology, especially during early stages of growth, and as such farmers are often forced to abandon these otherwise potentially usable areas.progress has been made, however, in developing rice varieties capable of tolerating such conditions; the hybrid created from the cross between the commercial rice variety ir56 and the wild rice species oryza coarctata is one example. o. coarctata is capable of successful growth in soils with double the limit of salinity of normal varieties, but lacks the ability to produce edible rice. developed by the international rice research institute, the hybrid variety can utilise specialised leaf glands that allow for the removal of salt into the atmosphere. it was initially produced from one successful embryo out of 34,000 crosses between the two species; this was then backcrossed to ir56 with the aim of preserving the genes responsible for salt tolerance that were inherited from o. coarctata. extensive trials are planned prior to the new variety being available to farmers by approximately 2017014 study of han chinese communities found that a history of farming rice makes cultures more psychologically interdependent, whereas a history of farming wheat makes cultures more independent.a royal ploughing ceremony is held in certain asian countries to mark the beginning of the rice planting season. it is still honored in the kingdoms of cambodia and thailand.* calpe, concepci1st century (2005. online",1,0
"grief is the response to loss, particularly to the loss of someone or something that has died, to which a bond or affection was formed. although conventionally focused on the emotional response to loss, it also has physical, cognitive, behavioral, social, cultural, spiritual and philosophical dimensions. while the terms are often used interchangeably, bereavement refers to the state of loss, and grief is the reaction to that loss.the grief associated with death is familiar to most people, but individuals grieve in connection with a variety of losses throughout their lives, such as unemployment, ill health or the end of a relationship. loss can be categorized as either physical or abstract. the physical loss being related to something that the individual can touch or measure006, there was extensive skepticism about a universal and predictable ""emotional pathway"" that leads from distress to ""recovery"" with an appreciation that grief is a more complex process of adapting to loss than stage and phase models have previously suggested. the two-track model of bereavement, created by simon shimshon rubin in 1981, is a grief theory that provided deeper focus on the grieving process. the model examines the long-term effects of bereavement by measuring how well the person is adapting to the loss of a significant person in their life. the main objective of the two-track model of bereavement is for the individual to ""manage and live in reality in which the deceased is absent"" as well as returning to normal biological functioning. the authors from whats your grief?, litza williams and eleanor haley, state in their understanding of the clinical and therapeutic uses of the model:008 survey, 27% of respondents who had lost a loved one said they had this kind of ""contact"" experience.george bonanno, a professor of clinical psychology at columbia university, conducted more than two decades of scientific studies on grief and trauma, which have been published in several papers in the most respected peer-reviewed journals in the field of psychology, such as psychological science and the journal of abnormal psychology. subjects of his studies number in the several thousand and include people who have suffered losses in the u.s. and cross-cultural studies in various countries around the world, such as israel, bosnia-herzegovina, and china. his subjects suffered losses through war, terrorism, deaths of children, premature deaths of spouses, sexual abuse, childhood diagnoses of aids, and other potentially devastating loss events or potential trauma events.in bonannos book, the other side of sadness: what the new science of bereavement tells us about life after a loss   the first researcher to use pre-loss data, he outlined four trajectories of grief. bonannos work has also demonstrated that absence of grief or trauma symptoms is a healthy outcome, rather than something to be feared as has been the thought and practice until his research. because grief responses can take many forms, including laughter, celebration, and bawdiness, in addition to sadness, bonanno coined the phrase ""coping ugly"" to describe the idea that some forms of coping may seem counter intuitive. bonanno has found that resilience is natural to humans, suggesting that it cannot be ""taught"" through specialized programs and that there is virtually no existing research with which to design resilience training, nor is there existing research to support major investment in such things as military resilience training programs.the four trajectories are as follows:the k months, when attachment and separation are at their height and even a brief separation from a parent or other caregiver can cause distress.even as a child grows older, death is still difficult to fathom and this affects how a child responds. for example, younger children see death more as a separation, and may believe death is curable or temporary. reactions can manifest themselves in ""acting out"" behaviors, a return to earlier behaviors such as thumb sucking, clinging to a toy or angry behavior. though they do not have the maturity to mourn as an adult, they feel the same intensity. as children enter pre-teen and teen years, there is a more mature understanding.adolescents may respond by delinquency, or oppositely become ""over-achievers"". repetitive actions are not uncommon such as washing a car repeatedly or taking up repetitive tasks such as sewing, computer games, etc. it is an effort to stay above the grief. childhood loss can predispose a child not only to physical illness but to emotional problems and an increased risk for suicide, especially in the adolescent period.children can experience grief as a result of losses due to causes other than death. for example, children who have been physically, psychologically or sexually abused often grieve over the damage to or the loss of their ability to trust. since such children usually have no support or acknowledgement from any source outside the family unit, this is likely to be experienced as disenfranchised grief.relocations can cause children significant grief particularly if they are combined with other difficult circumstances such as neglectful or abusive parental behaviors, other significant losses, etc.children may experience the death of a friend or a classmate through illness, accidents, suicide, or violence.  initial support involves reassuring children that their emotional and physical feelings are normal.survivor guilt grief may occur after the loss of a romantic relationship many of the above examples of bereavement happen abruptly, but there are also cases of being gradually bereft of something or someone. for example, the gradual loss of a loved one by alzheimers produces a \x80\x93 the elephants, upon finding a dead herd member, pause for several minutes at a time, and carefully touch and hold the dead creatures bones.some birds seem to lack the perception of grief or quickly accept it; mallard hens, although shocked for a moment when losing one of their young to a predator, will soon return to doing what they were doing before the predator attacked. however, some other waterbirds, such as mute swans are known to grieve for the loss of a partner or cygnet, and are known to engage in pining for days, weeks or even months at a time. other species of swans such as the black swan have also been observed mourning the loss of a close relative.another form of grief in animals is when an individual loses its mate; this can be especially brutal when the species is monogamous. so when a pair bonding species, such as a black-backed jackal, loses its mate it can be very difficult for it to detach itself from its dead mate.",1,0
"statistics is the discipline that concerns the collection, organization, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data. in applying statistics to a scientific, industrial, or social problem, it is conventional to begin with a statistical population or a statistical model to be studied. populations can be diverse groups of people or objects such as ""all people living in a country"" or ""every atom composing a crystal"". statistics deals with every aspect of data, including the planning of data collection in terms of the design of surveys and experiments. for a list of terms and topics, see the glossary of probability and statistics.when census data cannot be collected, statisticians collect data by developing specific experiment designs and survey samples. representative sampling assures that inferences and conclusions can reasonably extend from the sample to the population as a whole. an experimental study involves taking measurements of the system under study, manipulating the system, and then taking additional measurements using the same procedure to determine if the manipulation has modified the values of the measurements. in contrast, an observational study does not involve experimental manipulation.two main statistical methods are used in data analysis: descriptive statistics, which summarize data from a sample using indexes such as the mean or standard deviation, and inferential statistics, which draw conclusions from data that are subject to random variation  descriptive statistics are most often concerned with two sets of properties of a distribution  multiple problems have come to be associated with this framework, ranging from obtaining a sufficient sample size to specifying an adequate null hypothesis.measurement processes that generate statistical data are also subject to error. many of these errors are classified as random  and al-kindi  in the 18th century, statistics also started to draw heavily from calculus. in more recent years statistics has relied more on statistical software.statistics is a mathematical body of science that pertains to the collection, analysis, interpretation or explanation, and presentation of data, or as a branch of mathematics. some consider statistics to be a distinct mathematical science rather than a branch of mathematics. while many scientific investigations make use of data, statistics is concerned with the use of data in the context of uncertainty and decision making in the face of uncertainty.in applying statistics to a problem, it is common practice to start with a population or process to be studied. populations can be diverse topics such as ""all people living in a country"" or ""every atom composing a crystal"". ideally, statisticians compile data about the entire population the earliest writings on probability and statistics date back to arab mathematicians and cryptographers, during the islamic golden age between the 8th and 13th centuries. al-khalil  the earliest book on statistics is the 9th-century treatise manuscript on deciphering cryptographic messages, written by arab scholar al-kindi  al-kindi also made the earliest known use of statistical inference, while he and later arab cryptographers developed the early statistical methods for decoding encrypted messages. ibn adlan the earliest european writing on statistics dates back to 1663, with the publication of natural and political observations upon the bills of mortality by john graunt. early applications of statistical thinking revolved around the needs of states to base policy on demographic and economic data, hence its stat- etymology. the scope of the discipline of statistics broadened in the early 19th century to include the collection and analysis of data in general. today, statistics is widely employed in government, business, and natural and social sciences.the mathematical foundations of modern statistics were laid in the 17th century with the development of the probability theory by gerolamo cardano, blaise pascal and pierre de fermat. mathematical probability theory arose from the study of games of chance, although the concept of probability was already examined in medieval law and by philosophers such as juan caramuel. the method of least squares was first described by adrien-marie legendre in 1805.the modern field of statistics emerged in the late 19th and early 20th century in three stages. the first wave, at the turn of the century, was led by the work of francis galton and karl pearson, who transformed statistics into a rigorous mathematical discipline used for analysis, not just in science, but in industry and politics as well. galtons contributions included introducing the concepts of standard deviation, correlation, regression analysis and the application of these methods to the study of the variety of human characteristics0s was initiated by william sealy gosset, and reached its culmination in the insights of ronald fisher, who wrote the textbooks that were to define the academic discipline in universities around the world. fishers most important publications were his 1918 seminal paper the correlation between relatives on the supposition of mendelian inheritance  where he developed rigorous design of experiments models. he originated the concepts of sufficiency, ancillary statistics, fishers linear discriminator and fisher information. in his 1930 book the genetical theory of natural selection, he applied statistics to various biological concepts such as fishers principle  a concept in sexual selection about a positive feedback runaway affect found in evolution.the final wave, which mainly saw the refinement and expansion of earlier developments, emerged from the collaborative work between egon pearson and jerzy neyman in the 1930s. they introduced the concepts of ""type ii"" error, power of a test and confidence intervals. jerzy neyman in 1934 showed that stratified random sampling was in general a better method of estimation than purposive today, statistical methods are applied in all fields that involve decision making, for making accurate inferences from a collated body of data and for making decisions in the face of uncertainty based on statistical methodology. the use of modern computers has expedited large-scale statistical computations and has also made possible new methods that are impractical to perform manually. statistics continues to be an area of active research for example on the problem of how to analyze big data.when full census data cannot be collected, statisticians collect sample data by developing specific experiment designs and survey samples. statistics itself also provides tools for prediction and forecasting through statistical models. the idea of making inferences based on sampled data began around the mid-1600s in connection with estimating populations and developing precursors of life insurance.to use a sample as a guide to an entire population, it is important that it truly represents the overall population. representative sampling assures that inferences and conclusions can safely extend from the sample to the population as a whole. a major problem lies in determining the extent that the sample chosen is actually representative. statistics offers methods to estimate and correct for any bias within the sample and data collection procedures. there are also methods of experimental design for experiments that can lessen these issues at the outset of a study, strengthening its capability to discern truths about the population.sampling theory is part of the mathematical discipline of probability theory. probability is used in mathematical statistics to study the sampling distributions of sample statistics and, more generally, the properties of statistical procedures. the use of any statistical method is valid when the system or population under consideration satisfies the assumptions of the method. the difference in point of view between classic probability theory and sampling theory is, roughly, that probability theory starts from the given parameters of a total population to deduce probabilities that pertain to samples. statistical inference, however, moves in the opposite directiona descriptive statistic  while descriptive statistics in the mass noun sense is the process of using and analyzing those statistics. descriptive statistics is distinguished from inferential statistics  inferential statistical analysis infers properties of a population, for example by testing hypotheses and deriving estimates.  it is assumed that the observed data set is sampled from a larger population. inferential statistics can be contrasted with descriptive statistics. descriptive statistics is solely concerned with properties of the observed data, and it does not rest on the assumption that the data come from a larger population.consider independent identically distributed  the population being examined is described by a probability distribution that may have unknown parameters.a statistic is a random variable that is a function of the random sample, but not a function of unknown parameters. the probability distribution of the statistic, though, may have unknown parameters.consider now a function of the unknown parameter: an estimator is a statistic used to estimate such function. commonly used estimators include sample mean, unbiased sample variance and sample covariance.a random variable that is a function of the random sample and of the unknown parameter, but whose probability distribution does not depend on the unknown parameter is called a pivotal quantity or pivot. widely used pivots include the z-score, the chi square statistic and students t-value.between two estimators of a given parameter, the one with lower mean squared error is said to be more efficient. furthermore, an estimator is said to be unbiased if its expected value is equal to the true value of the unknown parameter being estimated, and asymptotically unbiased if its expected value converges at the limit to the true value of such parameter.other desirable properties for estimators include: umvue estimators that have the lowest variance for all possible values of the parameter to be estimated the best illustration for a novice is the predicament encountered by a criminal trial. the null hypothesis, h0, asserts that the defendant is innocent, whereas the alternative hypothesis, h1, asserts that the defendant is guilty. the indictment comes because of suspicion of the guilt. the h0 most studies only sample part of a population, so results dont fully represent the whole population. any estimates obtained from the sample only approximate the population value. confidence intervals allow statisticians to express how closely the sample estimate matches the true value in the whole population. often they are expressed as 95% confidence intervals. formally, a 95% confidence interval for a value is a range where, if the sampling and analysis were repeated under the same conditions  is to test a null hypothesis against an alternative hypothesis. a critical region is the set of values of the estimator that leads to refuting the null hypothesis. the probability of type i error is therefore the probability that the estimator belongs to the critical region given that null hypothesis is true  a mistrust and misunderstanding of statistics is associated with the quotation, ""there are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics"". misuse of statistics can be both inadvertent and intentional, and the book how to lie with statistics outlines a range of considerations. in an attempt to shed light on the use and misuse of statistics, reviews of statistical techniques used in particular fields are conducted ways to avoid misuse of statistics include using proper diagrams and avoiding bias. misuse can occur when conclusions are overgeneralized and claimed to be representative of more than they really are, often by either deliberately or unconsciously overlooking sampling bias. bar graphs are arguably the easiest diagrams to use and understand, and they can be made either by hand or with simple computer programs. unfortunately, most people do not look for bias or errors, so they are not noticed. thus, people may often believe that something is true even if it is not well represented. to make data gathered from statistics believable and accurate, the sample taken must be representative of the whole. according to huff, ""the dependability of a sample can be destroyed by ... allow yourself some degree of skepticism.""to assist in the understanding of statistics huff proposed a series of questions to be asked in each case:the concept of correlation is particularly noteworthy for the potential confusion it can cause. statistical analysis of a data set often reveals that two variables  theoretical statistics concerns the logical arguments underlying justification of approaches to statistical inference, as well as encompassing mathematical statistics. mathematical statistics includes not only the manipulation of probability distributions necessary for deriving results related to methods of estimation and inference, but also various aspects of computational statistics and the design of experiments.statistical consultants can help organizations and companies that dont have in-house expertise relevant to their particular questions.machine learning models are statistical and probabilistic models that capture patterns in the data through use of computational algorithms.statistics is applicable to a wide variety of academic disciplines, including natural and social sciences, government, and business. business statistics applies statistical methods in econometrics, auditing and production and operations, including services improvement and marketing research. in the field of biological sciences, the 12 most frequent statistical tests are: analysis of variance , cluster analysis, spearman0th century have had a substantial impact on the practice of statistical science. early statistical models were almost always from the class of linear models, but powerful computers, coupled with suitable numerical algorithms, caused an increased interest in nonlinear models  this tradition has changed with the use of statistics in non-inferential contexts. what was once considered a dry subject, taken in many fields as a degree-requirement, is now viewed enthusiastically. initially derided by some mathematical purists, it is now considered essential methodology in certain areas.statistical techniques are used in a wide range of types of scientific and social research, including: biostatistics, computational biology, computational sociology, network biology, social science, sociology and social research. some fields of inquiry use applied statistics so extensively that they have specialized terminology. these disciplines include:in addition, there are particular types of statistical analysis that have also developed their own specialised terminology and methodology:statistics form a key basis tool in business and manufacturing as well. it is used to understand measurement systems variability, control processes (as in statistical process control or spc, for summarizing data, and to make data-driven decisions. in these roles, it is a key tool, and perhaps the only reliable tool.",1,0

"the mediterranean sea is a sea connected to the atlantic ocean, surrounded by the mediterranean basin and almost completely enclosed by land: on the north by western and southern europe and anatolia, on the south by north africa, and on the east by the levant. although the sea is sometimes considered a part of the atlantic ocean, it is usually referred to as a separate body of water. geological evidence indicates that around 5.9,500,000  representing 0.7% of the global ocean surface, but its connection to the atlantic via the strait of gibraltar , which sometimes means only the aegean sea. the origin of the name is not clear, as it is not known in earlier greek, byzantine or islamic sources. it may be to contrast with the black sea. in persian, the name was translated as ba019, the archaeological team of experts from underwater research center of the akdeniz university the western roman empire collapsed around 476 ad. temporarily the east was again dominant as roman power lived on in the byzantine empire formed in the 4th century from the eastern half of the roman empire. another power arose in the 7th century, and with it the religion of islam, which soon swept across from the east; at its greatest extent, the arab empire controlled 75% of the mediterranean region and left a lasting footprint on its eastern and southern shores.the arab invasions disrupted the trade relations between western and eastern europe while disrupting trade routes with eastern asian empires. this, however, had the indirect effect of promoting the trade across the caspian sea. the export of grains from egypt was re-routed towards the eastern world. products from east asian empires, like silk and spices, were carried from egypt to ports like venice and constantinople by sailors and jewish merchants. the viking raids further disrupted the trade in western europe and brought it to a halt. however, the norsemen developed the trade from norway to the white sea, while also trading in luxury goods from spain and the mediterranean. the byzantines in the mid-8th century retook control of the area around the north-eastern part of the mediterranean. venetian ships from the 9th century armed themselves to counter the harassment by arabs while concentrating trade of asian goods in venice.the fatimids maintained trade relations with the italian city-states like amalfi and genoa before the crusades, according to the cairo geniza documents. a document dated 996 mentions amalfian merchants living in cairo. another letter states that the genoese had traded with alexandria. the caliph al-mustansir had allowed amalfian merchants to reside in jerusalem about 1060 in place of the latin hospice.the crusades led to flourishing of trade between europe and the outremer region. genoa, venica and pisa created colonies in regions controlled by the crusaders and came to control the trade with the orient. these colonies also allowed them to trade with the eastern world. though the fall of the crusader states and attempts at banning of trade relations with muslim states by the popes temporarily disrupted the trade with the orient, it however continued.europe started to revive, however, as more organized and centralized states began to form in the later middle ages after the renaissance of the 12th century.ottoman power based in anatolia continued to grow, and in 1453 extinguished the byzantine empire with the conquest of constantinople. ottomans gained control of much of the sea in the 16th century and maintained naval bases in southern france  according to robert davis, from the 16th to 19th centuries, pirates captured 15013, the maltese president described the mediterranean sea as a ""cemetery"" due to the large number of migrants who drowned there after their boats capsized. european parliament president martin schulz said in 2014 that europes migration policy ""turned the mediterranean into a graveyard"", referring to the number of drowned refugees in the region as a direct result of the policies. an azerbaijani official described the sea as ""a burial ground ... where people die"".following the 2013 lampedusa migrant shipwreck, the italian government decided to strengthen the national system for the patrolling of the mediterranean sea by authorising ""operation mare nostrum"", a military and humanitarian mission in order to rescue the migrants and arrest the traffickers of immigrants. in 2015, more than one million migrants crossed the mediterranean sea into europe.italy was particularly affected by the european migrant crisis. since 2013, over 700,000 migrants have landed in italy, mainly sub-saharan africans.the mediterranean sea connects:the 163 marginal seas:note 1: the international hydrographic organization defines the area as generic mediterranean sea, in the western basin. it does not recognize the label sea of sardinia.note 2: thracian sea and myrtoan sea are a sea that are part of the aegean sea.note 3: the black sea is not considered part of it.the international hydrographic organization defines the limits of the mediterranean sea as follows: stretching from the strait of gibraltar in the west to the entrances to the dardanelles and the suez canal in the east, the mediterranean sea is bounded by the coasts of europe, africa, and asia and is divided into two deep basins:the following countries have a coastline on the mediterranean sea:several other territories also border the mediterranean sea the coastline length is about 46,000 km.major cities some other seas whose names have been in common use from the ancient times, or in the present:many of these smaller seas feature in local myth and folklore and derive their names from such associations.in addition to the seas, a number of gulfs and straits are recognised:much of the mediterranean coast enjoys a hot-summer mediterranean climate. however, most of its southeastern coast has a hot desert climate, and much of spains eastern  evaporation is especially high in its eastern half, causing the water level to decrease and salinity to increase eastward. the average salinity in the basin is 38 psu at 5 m depth.the temperature of the water in the deepest part of the mediterranean sea is 13.2.21st century, with notable consequences on water circulation and biogeochemistry.in spite of its great biodiversity, concentrations of chlorophyll and nutrients in the mediterranean sea are very low, making it one of the most oligotrophic ocean regions in the world. the mediterranean sea is commonly referred to as an lnlc  for this reason, the eastern part of the mediterranean sea is termed ""ultraoligotrophic"". the productive areas of the mediterranean sea are few and small. high primary productivity in the mediterranean is also marked by an intense seasonal variability. in winter, the strong winds and precipitation over the basin generate vertical mixing, bringing nutrients from the deep waters to the surface, where phytoplankton can convert it into biomass. however, in winter, light may be the limiting factor for primary productivity. between march and april, spring offers the ideal trade-off between light intensity and nutrient concentrations in surface for a spring bloom to occur. in summer, high atmospheric temperatures lead to the warming of the surface waters. the resulting density difference virtually isolates the surface waters from the rest of the water column and nutrient exchanges are limited. as a consequence, primary productivity is very low between june and october.oceanographic expeditions uncovered a characteristic feature of the mediterranean sea biogeochemistry: most of the chlorophyll production does not occur on the surface, but in sub-surface waters between 80 and 200 meters deep. another key characteristic of the mediterranean is its high nitrogen-to-phosphorus ratio because of its low productivity, plankton assemblages in the mediterranean sea are dominated by small organisms such as picophytoplankton and bacteria.the geologic history of the mediterranean sea is complex. underlain by oceanic crust, the sea basin was once thought to be a tectonic remnant of the ancient tethys ocean; it is now known to be a structurally younger basin, called the neotethys, which was first formed by the convergence of the african and eurasian plates during the late triassic and early jurassic. because it is a near-landlocked body of water in a normally dry climate, the mediterranean is subject to intensive evaporation and the precipitation of evaporites. the messinian salinity crisis started about six million years ago scientists estimate that the sea was last filled about 5.3003, the world wildlife fund raised concerns about the widespread drift net fishing endangering populations of dolphins, turtles, and other marine animals such as the spiny squat lobster.there was a resident population of killer whale in the mediterranean until the 1980s, when they went extinct, probably due to longterm pcb exposure. there are still annual sightings of killer whale vagrants.for 4,000 years, human activity has transformed most parts of mediterranean europe, and the ""humanisation of the landscape"" overlapped with the appearance of the present mediterranean climate. the image of a simplistic, environmental determinist notion of a mediterranean paradise on earth in antiquity, which was destroyed by later civilisations, dates back to at least the 18th century and was for centuries fashionable in archaeological and historical circles. based on a broad variety of methods, e.g. historical documents, analysis of trade relations, floodplain sediments, pollen, tree-ring and further archaeometric analyses and population studies, alfred thomas groves and oliver rackhams work on ""the nature of mediterranean europe"" challenges this common wisdom of a mediterranean europe as a ""lost eden"", a formerly fertile and forested region, that had been progressively degraded and desertified by human mismanagement. the belief stems more from the failure of the recent landscape to measure up to the imaginary past of the classics as idealised by artists, poets and scientists of the early modern enlightenment.the historical evolution of climate, vegetation and landscape in southern europe from prehistoric times to the present is much more complex and underwent various changes. for example, some of the deforestation had already taken place before the roman age. while in the roman age large enterprises such as the latifundia took effective care of forests and agriculture, the largest depopulation effects came with the end of the empire. some assume that the major deforestation took place in modern times3,000 lives in sicily and calabria and was among the most deadly natural disasters in modern europe.the opening of the suez canal in 1869 created the first salt-water passage between the mediterranean and the red sea. the red sea is higher than the eastern mediterranean, so the canal functions as a tidal strait that pours red sea water into the mediterranean. the bitter lakes, which are hyper-saline natural lakes that form part of the canal, blocked the migration of red sea species into the mediterranean for many decades, but as the salinity of the lakes gradually equalised with that of the red sea, the barrier to migration was removed, and plants and animals from the red sea have begun to colonise the eastern mediterranean. the red sea is generally saltier and more nutrient-poor than the atlantic, so the red sea species have advantages over atlantic species in the salty and nutrient-poor eastern mediterranean. accordingly, red sea species invade the mediterranean biota, and not vice versa; this phenomenon is known as the lessepsian migration  introduced into the mediterranean through the suez canal. this makes the canal the first pathway of arrival of alien species into the mediterranean. the impacts of some lessepsian species have proven to be considerable, mainly in the levantine basin of the mediterranean, where they are replacing native species and becoming a familiar sight.according to the international union for conservation of nature definition, as well as convention on biological diversity in recent decades, the arrival of exotic species from the tropical atlantic has become noticeable. whether this reflects an expansion of the natural area of these species that now enter the mediterranean through the gibraltar strait, because of a warming trend of the water caused by global warming; or an extension of the maritime traffic; or is simply the result of a more intense scientific investigation, is still an open question. while not as intense as the ""lessepsian"" movement, the process may be of scientific interest and may therefore warrant increased levels of monitoring.by 2100 the overall level of the mediterranean could rise between 3 to 61. plastic debris accounted for 76%, of which 94% was plastic bags.some of the worlds busiest shipping routes are in the mediterranean sea. it is estimated that approximately 220,000 merchant vessels of more than 100 tonnes cross the mediterranean sea each year0 years and government scientists warn that without immediate action the stock will collapse.beach of hammamet, tunisiathe beach of la courtade in the

"the sahara  the name sahara is derived from the arabic word for ""desert"", ,800 kwh/ was 4700 and 400 metres  exceeds 40050,500 millimetres  nowhere else on earth has air been found as dry and evaporative as in the sahara region. however, at least two instances of snowfall have been recorded in sahara, in february 1979 and december 2016, both in the town of ain sefra.one theory for the formation of the sahara is that the monsoon in northern africa was weakened because of glaciation during the quaternary period, starting two or three million years ago. another theory is that the monsoon was weakened when the ancient tethys sea dried up during the tortonian period around 7 million years.the climate of the sahara has undergone enormous variations between wet and dry over the last few hundred thousand years, believed to be caused by long-term changes in the north african climate cycle that alters the path of the north african monsoon 24.5001.during the last glacial period, the sahara was much larger than it is today, extending south beyond its current boundaries. the end of the glacial period brought more rain to the sahara, from about 8000 bce to 6000 bce, perhaps because of low pressure areas over the collapsing ice sheets to the north. once the ice sheets were gone, the northern sahara dried out. in the southern sahara, the drying trend was initially counteracted by the monsoon, which brought rain further north than it does today. by around 4200 bce, however, the monsoon retreated south to approximately where it is today, leading to the gradual desertification of the sahara. the sahara is now as dry as it was about 13,000 years ago.the lake chad is the remnant of a former inland sea, paleolake mega-chad, which existed during the african humid period. at its largest extent, sometime before 5000 bc, lake mega-chad was the largest of four saharan paleolakes, and is estimated to have covered an area of 350,000 km2.the sahara pump theory describes this cycle. during periods of a wet or ""green sahara"", the sahara becomes a savanna grassland and various flora and fauna become more common. following inter-pluvial arid periods, the sahara area then reverts to desert conditions and the flora and fauna are forced to retreat northwards to the atlas mountains, southwards into west africa, or eastwards into the nile valley. this separates populations of some of the species in areas with different climates, forcing them to adapt, possibly giving rise to allopatric speciation.it is also proposed that humans accelerated the drying out period from 6,000,500 bce by pastoralists overgrazing available grassland.the growth of speleothems during the last glacial maximum  and the lower temperatures reduced the strength of the hadley cell. this is a climate cell which causes rising tropical air of the inter-tropical convergence zone  lake victoria only recently became the source of the white nile and dried out almost completely around 15 kya.the sudden subsequent movement of the itcz southwards with a heinrich event the sahara comprises several distinct ecoregions. with their variations in temperature, rainfall, elevation, and soil, these regions harbor distinct communities of plants and animals.the atlantic coastal desert is a narrow strip along the atlantic coast where fog generated offshore by the cool canary current provides sufficient moisture to sustain a variety of lichens, succulents, and shrubs. it covers an area of 39,900 square kilometers the north saharan steppe and woodlands is along the northern desert, next to the mediterranean forests, woodlands, and scrub ecoregions of the northern maghreb and cyrenaica. winter rains sustain shrublands and dry woodlands that form a transition between the mediterranean climate regions to the north and the hyper-arid sahara proper to the south. it covers 1,675,300 square kilometers the sahara desert ecoregion covers the hyper-arid central portion of the sahara where rainfall is minimal and sporadic. vegetation is rare, and this ecoregion consists mostly of sand dunes the south saharan steppe and woodlands ecoregion is a narrow band

volcanic highlands provide a cooler, moister environment that supports saharo-mediterranean woodlands and shrublands. the ecoregion covers 258,100 square kilometres the tibesti-jebel uweinat montane xeric woodlands ecoregion consists of the tibesti and jebel uweinat highlands. higher and more regular rainfall and cooler temperatures support woodlands and shrublands of date palm, acacias, myrtle, oleander, tamarix, and several rare and endemic plants. the ecoregion covers 82,200 square kilometres the saharan halophytics is an area of seasonally flooded saline depressions which is home to halophytic the tanezrouft is one of the harshest regions on earth as well as one of the hottest and driest parts of the sahara, with no vegetation and very little life. it is along the borders of algeria, niger, and mali, west of the hoggar mountains.the flora of the sahara is highly diversified based on the bio-geographical characteristics of this vast desert. floristically, the sahara has three zones based on the amount of rainfall received 800 species of vascular plants. approximately a quarter of these are endemic. about half of these species are common to the flora of the arabian deserts.the central sahara is estimated to include five hundred species of plants, which is extremely low considering the huge extent of the area. plants such as acacia trees, palms, succulents, spiny shrubs, and grasses have adapted to the arid conditions, by growing lower to avoid water loss by strong winds, by storing water in their thick stems to use it in dry periods, by having long roots that travel horizontally to reach the maximum area of water and to find any surface moisture, and by having small thick leaves or needles to prevent water loss by evapotranspiration. plant leaves may dry out totally and then recover.several species of fox live in the sahara including: the fennec fox, pale fox and r000 at a site known as gobero, located in niger in the t000 during an archaeological expedition led by paul sereno, which sought dinosaur remains. two distinct prehistoric cultures were discovered at the site: the early holocene kiffian culture, and the middle holocene tenerian culture. the kiffians were a prehistoric people who preceded the tenerians and vanished approximately 8000 years ago, when the desert became very dry. the desiccation lasted until around 4600 bce, when the earliest artefacts associated with the tenerians have been dated to. some 200 skeletons have been discovered at gobero. the tenerians were considerably shorter in height and less robust than the earlier kiffians. craniometric analysis also indicates that they were osteologically distinct. the kiffian skulls are akin to those of the late pleistocene iberomaurusians, early holocene capsians, and mid-holocene mechta groups, whereas the tenerian crania are more like those of mediterranean groups. graves show that the tenerians observed spiritual traditions, as they were buried with artifacts such as jewelry made of hippo tusks and clay pots. the most interesting find is a triple burial, dated to 5300 years ago, of an adult female and two children, estimated through their teeth as being five and eight years old, hugging each other. pollen residue indicates they were buried on a bed of flowers. the three are assumed to have died within 24 hours of each other, but as their skeletons hold no apparent trauma  the most noteworthy find at uan muhuggiag is the well-preserved mummy of a young boy of approximately  years old. the child was in a fetal position, then embalmed, then placed in a sack made of antelope skin, which was insulated by a layer of leaves. the boys organs were removed, as evidenced by incisions in his stomach and thorax, and an organic preservative was inserted to stop his body from decomposing. an ostrich eggshell necklace was also found around his neck. radiocarbon dating determined the age of the mummy to be approximately 5600 years old, which makes it about 1000 years older than the earliest previously recorded mummy in ancient egypt. in 1958,000 years. this complexity, as observed at nabta playa, and as expressed by different levels of authority within the society there, likely formed the basis for the structure of both the neolithic society at nabta and the old kingdom of egypt.by 6000 bce predynastic egyptians in the southwestern corner of egypt were herding cattle and constructing large buildings. subsistence in organized and permanent settlements in predynastic egypt by the middle of the 6th millennium bce centered predominantly on cereal and animal agriculture: cattle, goats, pigs and sheep. metal objects replaced prior ones of stone. tanning of animal skins, pottery and weaving were commonplace in this era also. there are indications of seasonal or only temporary occupation of the al fayyum in the 6th millennium bce, with food activities centering on fishing, hunting and food-gathering. stone arrowheads, knives and scrapers from the era are commonly found. burial items included pottery, jewelry, farming and hunting equipment, and assorted foods including dried meat and fruit. burial in desert environments appears to enhance egyptian preservation rites, and the dead were buried facing due west.by 3400 bce, the sahara was as dry as it is today, due to reduced precipitation and higher temperatures resulting from a shift in the earths orbit. as a result of this aridification, it became a largely impenetrable barrier to humans, with the remaining settlements mainly being concentrated around the numerous oases that dot the landscape. little trade or commerce is known to have passed through the interior in subsequent periods, the only major exception being the nile valley. the nile, however, was impassable at several cataracts, making trade and contact by boat difficult.the people of phoenicia, who flourished from 1200, the french penetrated hoggar mountains and defeated ahaggar tuareg in the battle of tit. the french colonial empire was the dominant presence in the sahara. it established regular air links from toulouse  a remarkable film shot by famous aviator captain ren02, founded khartoum in 1823, and conquered darfur in 1874. egypt, including the sudan, became a british protectorate in 1882. egypt and britain lost control of the sudan from 1882 to 1898 as a result of the mahdist war. after its capture by british troops in 1898, the sudan became an anglo-egyptian condominium.spain captured present-day western sahara after 1874, although rio del oro remained largely under sahrawi influence. in 1912, italy captured parts of what was to be named libya from the ottomans. to promote the roman catholic religion in the desert, pope pius ix appointed a delegate apostolic of the sahara and the sudan in 1868; later in the 19th century his jurisdiction was reorganized into the vicariate apostolic of sahara.egypt became independent of britain in 1936, although the anglo-egyptian treaty of 1936 allowed britain to keep troops in egypt and to maintain the british-egyptian condominium in the sudan. british military forces were withdrawn in 1954.most of the saharan states achieved independence after world war ii: libya in 1951; morocco, sudan, and tunisia in 1956; chad, mali, mauritania, and niger in 1960; and algeria in 1962. spain withdrew from western sahara in 1975, and it was partitioned between mauritania and morocco. mauritania withdrew in 1979; morocco continues to hold the territory.in the post\x80\x93 cape town highway which follows the nile. each of these highways is partially complete, with significant gaps and unpaved sections.the people of the sahara are of various origins. among them the amazigh including the tuareg, various arabized amazi\xc9\xa3 groups such as the hassaniya-speaking sahrawis, whose populations include the znaga, a tribe whose name is a remnant of the pre-historic zenaga language. other major groups of people include the: toubou, nubians, zaghawa, kanuri, hausa, songhai, beja, and fula/fulani  unlike neighboring west africa and the central governments of the states that comprise the sahara, the french language bears little relevance to inter-personal discourse and commerce within the region, its people retaining staunch ethnic and political affiliations with tuareg and berber leaders and culture. the legacy of the french colonial era administration is primarily manifested in the territorial reorganization enacted by the third and fourth republics, which engendered artificial political divisions within a hitherto isolated and porous region. diplomacy with local clients was conducted primarily in arabic, which was the traditional language of bureaucratic affairs. mediation of disputes and inter-agency communication was served by interpreters contracted by the french government, who, according to keenan, ""documented a space of intercultural mediation,"" contributing much to preserving the indigenous cultural identities in the region.",1,0
"an internship is a period of work experience offered by an organization for a limited period of time. once confined to medical graduates, internship is used for a wide range of placements in businesses, non-profit organizations and government agencies. they are typically undertaken by students and graduates looking to gain relevant skills and experience in a particular field. employers benefit from these placements because they often recruit employees from their best interns, who have known capabilities, thus saving time and money in the long run. internships are usually arranged by third-party organizations that recruit interns on behalf of industry groups. rules vary from country to country about when interns should be regarded as employees. the system can be open to exploitation by unscrupulous employers.internships for professional careers are similar in some ways.  similar to internships, apprenticeships transition students from vocational school into the workforce. the lack of standardization and oversight leaves the term ""internship"" open to broad interpretation. interns may be high school students, college and university students, or post-graduate adults. these positions may be paid or unpaid and are temporary. many large corporations, particularly investment banks, have ""insights"" programs that serve as a pre-internship event numbering a day to a week, either in person or virtually. typically, an internship consists of an exchange of services for experience between the intern and the organization. internships are used to determine if the intern still has an interest in that field after the real-life experience. in addition, an internship can be used to create a professional network that can assist with letters of recommendation or lead to future employment opportunities. the benefit of bringing an intern into full-time employment is that they are already familiar with the company, their position, and they typically need little to no training. internships provide current college students with the ability to participate in a field of their choice to receive hands-on learning about a particular future career, preparing them for full-time work following graduation.internships exist in a wide variety of industries and settings. an internship can be paid, unpaid, or partially paid  internships may be part-time or full-time and are usually flexible with students schedules. a typical internship lasts between one and four months, but can be shorter or longer, depending on the organization involved. the act of job shadowing may also constitute interning.another type of internship growing in popularity is the virtual internship, in which the intern works remotely, and is not physically present at the job location. it provides the capacity to gain job experience without the conventional requirement of being physically present in an office. the internship is conducted via virtual means, such as phone, email, and web communication. virtual interns generally have the opportunity to work at their own pace.companies in search of interns often find and place students in mostly unpaid internships, for a fee. these companies charge students to assist with research, promising to refund the fee if no internship is found. the programs vary and aim to provide internship placements at reputable companies. some companies may also provide controlled housing in a new city, mentorship, support, networking, weekend activities or academic credit.some companies specifically fund scholarships and grants for low-income applicants. critics of internships criticize the practice of requiring certain college credits to be obtained only through unpaid internships. depending on the cost of the school, this is often seen as an unethical practice, as it requires students to exchange paid-for and often limited tuition credits to work an uncompensated job. paying for academic credits is a way to ensure students complete the duration of the internship, since they can be held accountable by their academic institution. for example, a student may be awarded academic credit only after their university receives a positive review from the interns supervisor at the sponsoring organization.work experience in england was established in the 1970\x80\x94either for vocation reasons and commitment to alternative curricula or because they have social or behavioural problems.at university level, work experience is often offered between the second and final years of an undergraduate degree course, especially in the science, engineering and computing fields. courses of this nature are often called sandwich courses, with the work experience year itself known as the sandwich year. during this time, the students on work placement have the opportunity to use the skills and knowledge gained in their first two years, and see how they are applied to real world problems. this offers them useful insights for their final year and prepares them for the job market once their course has finished. some companies sponsor students in their final year at university with the promise of a job at the end of the course. this is an incentive for the student to perform well during the placement as it helps with two otherwise unwelcome stresses: the lack of money in the final year, and finding a job when the university course ends.",1,0
"gebrauchsmusik  is a german term, meaning ""utility music"", for music that exists not only for its own sake, but which was composed for some specific, identifiable purpose. this purpose can be a particular historical event, like a political rally or a military ceremony, or it can be more general, as with music written to accompany dance, or music written for amateurs or students to perform.while composer paul hindemith is probably the figure most identified with this expression, it seems to have been coined within the realm of musicology rather than composition. in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the modern academic discipline of musicology was formulated by a mainly german group of scholars who were interested not only in formal development and biographical data, but also to an extent in the sociopolitical position of music throughout history, and the relationship of music and musicians to society at large.perhaps the first such musicologist to use the word gebrauchsmusik was paul nettl1, who employed it in reference to half of his perceived binarism between that 17th-century dance music which was in fact danced to, and that which was written in dance forms but was actually abstract music intended only for listening . earlier  consciousness"", and condemned it as being not truly useful at all, due to what he considered its lack of emotional content. by the late 1950s, gebrauchsmusik had become almost universally a term of insult, especially among composers. no less than hindemith attempted, somewhat, to back away from it, when in a lecture at harvard in 1950, he said that ""quite obviously music for which no use can be found, that is to say, useless music, is not entitled to public consideration anyway and consequently the gebrauch is taken for granted"", and also that ""p to this day it has been impossible to kill the silly term and the unscrupulous classification that goes with it"" .adorno had included stravinsky among the targets of his anti-gebrauchsmusik diatribes, and though the terminology and classification-system under present consideration is clearly and primarily german, the impulse of composers to write and officials to commission music for specific or ceremonial use is quite obviously universal. stravinsky is perhaps not the best example of a non-german composer in such a vein who was active in the 1920s and 1930s, but he did make his name largely with a series of ballets. along with these, it will be well-remembered that immortal and beloved works of orff, kod1st century pushes the blinding political travails of times past into the fog of history, modern commentators have begun to consider that, while gebrauchsmusik may compromise the composer in some respects, many of the greatest works of not only the 20th century but the 19th and earlier (witness the french tradition of vast, ceremonial works from that period were composed with public and popular usage in mind. as kurt weill wrote in weill 1929, the use for which a composition was intended and its artistic value are matters for separate consideration. indeed, they always have been, and continue to be now; to this attests the continued success of the above-considered composers and their works long after their original ""utility"" has subsided.",1,0
"stoicism is a school of hellenistic philosophy founded by zeno of citium in athens in the early 3rd century bc. it is a philosophy of personal ethics informed by its system of logic and its views on the natural world. according to its teachings, as social beings, the path to eudaimonia  the stoics also held that certain destructive emotions resulted from errors of judgment, and they believed people should aim to maintain a will  to live a good life, one had to understand the rules of the natural order since they thought everything was rooted in nature.many stoics\x80\x94of humankind, and the futility and temporary nature of worldly possessions and attachments. both encourage ascesis with respect to the passions and inferior emotions, such as lust, and envy, so that the higher possibilities of ones humanity can be awakened and developed.stoic writings such as meditations by marcus aurelius have been highly regarded by many christians throughout the centuries. the eastern orthodox church and oriental orthodox church accept the stoic ideal of dispassion to this day.middle and roman stoics taught that sex is just within marriage, for unitive and procreative purposes only. this teaching is accepted by the catholic church to this day.saint ambrose of milan was known for applying stoic philosophy to his theology.",1,0
"aviation is the activities surrounding mechanical flight and the aircraft industry. aircraft includes fixed-wing and rotary-wing types, morphable wings, wing-less lifting bodies, as well as lighter-than-air craft such as hot air balloons and airships.aviation began in the 18th century with the development of the hot air balloon, an apparatus capable of atmospheric displacement through buoyancy. some of the most significant advancements in aviation technology came with the controlled gliding flying of otto lilienthal in 1896; then a large step in significance came with the construction of the first powered airplane by the wright brothers in the early 1900s. since that time, aviation has been technologically revolutionized by the introduction of the jet which permitted a major form of transport throughout the world.the word aviation was coined by the french writer and former naval officer gabriel la landelle in 1863. he derived the term from the verb avier there are early legends of human flight such as the stories of icarus in greek myth, jamshid and shah kay k9. however, the dominance of the zeppelins over the airplanes of that period, which had a range of only a few hundred miles, was diminishing as airplane design advanced. the ""golden age"" of the airships ended on may 6, 1937 when the hindenburg caught fire, killing 36 people. the cause of the hindenburg accident was initially blamed on the use of hydrogen instead of helium as the lift gas. an internal investigation by the manufacturer revealed that the coating used in the material covering the frame was highly flammable and allowed static electricity to build up in the airship. changes to the coating formulation reduced the risk of further hindenburg type accidents. although there have been periodic initiatives to revive their use, airships have seen only niche application since that time.in 1799, sir george cayley set forth the concept of the modern airplane as a fixed-wing flying machine with separate systems for lift, propulsion, and control. early dirigible developments included machine-powered propulsion  seven years later, on 14 october 1897, aders avion iii was tested without success in front of two officials from the french war ministry. the report on the trials was not publicized until 1910, as they had been a military secret. in november 1906, ader claimed to have made a successful flight on 14 october 1897, achieving an ""uninterrupted flight"" of around 300 metres the wright brothers made the first successful powered, controlled and sustained airplane flight on december 17, 1903, a feat made possible by their invention of three-axis control. only a decade later, at the start of world war i, heavier-than-air powered aircraft had become practical for reconnaissance, artillery spotting, and even attacks against ground positions.aircraft began to transport people and cargo as designs grew larger and more reliable. the wright brothers took aloft the first passenger, charles furnas, one of their mechanics, on may 14, 1908.during the 1920s and 1930s great progress was made in the field of aviation, including the first transatlantic flight of alcock and brown in 1919, charles lindberghs solo transatlantic flight in 1927, and charles kingsford smiths transpacific flight the following year. one of the most successful designs of this period was the douglas dc-3, which became the first airliner to be profitable carrying passengers exclusively, starting the modern era of passenger airline service. by the beginning of world war ii, many towns and cities had built airports, and there were numerous qualified pilots available. the war brought many innovations to aviation, including the first jet aircraft and the first liquid-fueled rockets.after world war ii, especially in north america, there was a boom in general aviation, both private and commercial, as thousands of pilots were released from military service and many inexpensive war-surplus transport and training aircraft became available. manufacturers such as cessna, piper, and beechcraft expanded production to provide light aircraft for the new middle-class market.by the 1950s, the development of civil jets grew, beginning with the de havilland comet, though the first widely used passenger jet was the boeing 707, because it was much more economical than other aircraft at that time. at the same time, turboprop propulsion began to appear for smaller commuter planes, making it possible to serve small-volume routes in a much wider range of weather conditions.since the 1960s composite material airframes and quieter, more efficient engines have become available, and concorde provided supersonic passenger service for more than two decades, but the most important lasting innovations have taken place in instrumentation and control. the arrival of solid-state electronics, the global positioning system, satellite communications, and increasingly small and powerful computers and led displays, have dramatically changed the cockpits of airliners and, increasingly, of smaller aircraft as well. pilots can navigate much more accurately and view terrain, obstructions, and other nearby aircraft on a map or through synthetic vision, even at night or in low visibility.on june 21, 2004, spaceshipone became the first privately funded aircraft to make a spaceflight, opening the possibility of an aviation market capable of leaving the earths atmosphere. meanwhile, flying prototypes of aircraft powered by alternative fuels, such as ethanol, electricity, and even solar energy, are becoming more common.civil aviation includes all non-military flying, both general aviation and scheduled air transport.there are five major manufacturers of civil transport aircraft until the 1970s, most major airlines were flag carriers, sponsored by their governments and heavily protected from competition. since then, open skies agreements have resulted in increased competition and choice for consumers, coupled with falling prices for airlines. the combination of high fuel prices, low fares, high salaries, and crises such as the september 11, 2001 attacks and the sars epidemic have driven many older airlines to government-bailouts, bankruptcy or mergers. at the same time, low-cost carriers such as ryanair, southwest and westjet have flourished.general aviation includes all non-scheduled civil flying, both private and commercial. general aviation may include business flights, air charter, private aviation, flight training, ballooning, paragliding, parachuting, gliding, hang gliding, aerial photography, foot-launched powered hang gliders, air ambulance, crop dusting, charter flights, traffic reporting, police air patrols and forest fire fighting.each country regulates aviation differently, but general aviation usually falls under different regulations depending on whether it is private or commercial and on the type of equipment involved.many small aircraft manufacturers serve the general aviation market, with a focus on private aviation and flight training.the most important recent developments for small aircraft the first fatal aviation accident occurred in a wright model a aircraft at fort myer, virginia, usa, on september 17, 1908, resulting in injury to the pilot, orville wright, and death of the passenger, signal corps lieutenant thomas selfridge.an aviation incident is defined as an occurrence, other than an accident, associated with the operation of an aircraft that affects or could affect the safety of operations.an accident in which the damage to the aircraft is such that it must be written off, or in which the plane is destroyed, is called a hull loss accident.air traffic control (atc involves communication with aircraft to help maintain separation are also produced. in addition, there are environmental impacts specific to aviation: for instance, another environmental impact of aviation is noise pollution, mainly caused by aircraft taking off and landing.",1,0
"mental health, defined by the world health organization  the three core components of this definition are  according to the who, mental health includes ""subjective well-being, perceived self-efficacy, autonomy, competence, intergenerational dependence, and self-actualization of ones intellectual and emotional potential, among others"". from the perspectives of positive psychology or of holism, mental health may include an individuals ability to enjoy life and to create a balance between life activities and efforts to achieve psychological resilience. cultural differences, subjective assessments, and competing professional theories all affect how one defines ""mental health"".according to the u.k. surgeon journal  mental health has long been defined as the absence of psychopathologies, such as depression and anxiety. the absence of mental illness, however, is a minimal outcome from a psychological perspective on lifespan development. corey m keyes has created a two continua model of mental illness and health which holds that both are related, but distinct dimensions: one continuum indicates the presence or absence of mental health, the other the presence or absence of mental illness. for example, people with optimal mental health can also have a mental illness, and people who have no mental illness can also have poor mental health. indeed, the world health organization distinguishes mental health from mental illness: ""{mental health}... a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity"".marie jahoda described six major, fundamental categories that can be used to categorize mentally healthy individuals. these include a positive attitude towards the self, personal growth, integration, autonomy, a true perception of reality, and environmental mastery, which include adaptability and healthy interpersonal relationships.mental health problems may arise due to stress, loneliness, depression, anxiety, relationship problems, death of a loved one, suicidal thoughts, grief, addiction, adhd, self-harm, various mood disorders, or other mental illnesses of varying degrees, as well as learning disabilities. therapists, psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, nurse practitioners, or family physicians can help manage mental illness with treatments such as therapy, counseling, or medication.in the mid-19th century, william sweetser was the first to coin the term mental hygiene, which can be seen as the precursor to contemporary approaches to work on promoting positive mental health. isaac ray, the fourth president of the american psychiatric association and one of its founders, further defined mental hygiene as ""the art of preserving the mind against all incidents and influences calculated to deteriorate its qualities, impair its energies, or derange its movements"".in american history, mentally ill patients were thought to be religiously punished. this response persisted through the 1700s, along with inhumane confinement and stigmatization of such individuals. dorothea dix  this became known as the ""mental hygiene movement"". before this movement, it was not uncommon that people affected by mental illness would be considerably neglected, often left alone in deplorable conditions without sufficient clothing. from 1840-1880, she won over the support of the federal government to set up over 30 state psychiatric hospitals; however, they were understaffed, under-resourced, and were accused of violating human rights.emil kraepelin in 1896 developed the taxonomy of mental disorders which has dominated the field for nearly 80 years. later, the proposed disease model of abnormality was subjected to analysis and considered normality to be relative to the physical, geographical and cultural aspects of the defining group.at the beginning of the 20th century, clifford beers founded ""mental health america 6 percent of all americans over the age of 18 meet the criteria for having a mental illness. evidence suggests that 450 million people worldwide have some mental illness. major depression ranks fourth among the top 10 leading causes of disease worldwide.  by 2029, mental illness is predicted to become the leading cause of disease worldwide. women are more likely to have a mental illness than men. one million people commit suicide every year and 10 to 20 million attempt it. a world health organization evidence from the who suggests that nearly half of the worlds population is affected by mental illness with an impact on their self-esteem, relationships and ability to function in everyday life. an individuals emotional health can impact their physical health. poor mental health can lead to problems such as the ability to make adequate decisions and substance abuse.good mental health can improve life quality whereas poor mental health can worsen it. according to richards, campania, & muse-burke, ""there is growing evidence that is showing emotional abilities are associated with pro-social behaviors such as stress management and physical health."" their research also concluded that people who lack emotional expression are inclined to anti-social behaviors  adults and children who face mental illness may experience social stigma, which can exacerbate the issues.mental health can be seen as an unstable continuum, where an individuals mental health may have many different possible values. mental wellness is generally viewed as a positive attribute, even if the person does not have any diagnosed mental health condition. this definition of mental health highlights emotional well-being, the capacity to live a full and creative life, and the flexibility to deal with lifes inevitable challenges. some discussions are formulated in terms of contentment or happiness. many therapeutic systems and self-help books offer methods and philosophies espousing strategies and techniques vaunted as effective for further improving the mental wellness. positive psychology is increasingly prominent in mental health.a holistic model of mental health generally includes concepts based upon anthropological, educational, psychological, religious, and sociological perspectives. there are also models as theoretical perspectives from personality, social, clinical, health and developmental psychology.the tripartite model of mental well-being views mental well-being as encompassing three components of emotional well-being, social well-being, and psychological well-being. emotional well-being is defined as having high levels of positive emotions, whereas social and psychological well-being are defined as the presence of psychological and social skills and abilities that contribute to optimal functioning in daily life. the model has received empirical support across cultures. the mental health continuum-short form according to 2020 data, mental illnesses have a stagnant incidence among adults but are increasing among the youth, categorized as 12 to 17-year-olds. approximately 13% of youth in the united states reported suffering from at least one major depressive episode in 2019-20, with the greatest increase  only 28% receive consistent treatment and 70% are left untreated. in lower-income communities, it is more common to forego treatment as a result of financial resources. being left untreated also leads to unhealthy coping mechanisms such as substance abuse, which in turn causes its own host of mental health issues.mental health and stability is a very important factor in a persons everyday life. the human brain develops many skills at an early age including social skills, behavioral skills, and ones way of thinking. learning how to interact with others and how to focus on certain subjects are essential lessons to learn at a young age. this starts from the time we can talk all the way to when we are so old that we can barely walk. however, there are people in society who have difficulties with these skills and behave differently. a mental illness consists of a wide range of conditions that affects a persons mood, thinking, and behavior. about 26% of people in the united states, ages 18 and older, have been diagnosed with some kind of mental disorder. however, not much is said about children with mental illnesses even though many develop one, even as early as age three.the most common mental illnesses in children include, but are not limited to anxiety disorder, as well as depression in older children and teens. having a mental illness at a younger age is different from having one in adulthood. childrens brains are still developing and will continue to develop until around the age of twenty-five.  when a mental illness is thrown into the mix, it becomes significantly harder for a child to acquire the necessary skills and habits that people use throughout the day. for example, behavioral skills dont develop as fast as motor or sensory skills do. so when a child has an anxiety disorder, they begin to lack proper social interaction and associate many ordinary things with intense fear. this can be scary for the child because they dont necessarily understand why they act and think the way that they do. many researchers say that parents should keep an eye on their child if they have any reason to believe that something is slightly off. if the children are evaluated earlier, they become more acquainted to their disorder and treating it becomes part of their daily routine. this is opposed to adults who might not recover as quickly because it is more difficult for them to adopt when already being accustomed to a certain direction of life.mental illness affects not only the person themselves but the people around them. friends and family also play an important role in the childs mental health stability and treatment. if the child is young, parents are the ones who evaluate their child and decide whether or not they need some form of help. friends are a support system for the child and family as a whole. living with a mental disorder is never easy, so its always important to have people around to make the days a little easier. however, there are negative factors that come with the social aspect of mental illness as well. parents are sometimes held responsible for their childs illness. people also say that the parents raised their children in a certain way or they acquired their behavior from them. family and friends are sometimes so ashamed of the idea of being close to someone with a disorder that the child feels isolated and thinks that they have to hide their illness from others. when in reality, hiding it from people prevents the child from getting the right amount of social interaction and treatment to thrive in todays society.stigmas are also a well-known factor in mental illness.  a stigma is defined as 018 such as with the creation of the religious liberty task force in july of that year. also, many providers and practitioners in the united states are only beginning to realize that the institution of mental healthcare lacks knowledge and competence of many non-western cultures, leaving providers in the united states ill-equipped to treat patients from different cultures.social work in mental health, also called psychiatric social work, is a process where an individual in a setting is helped to attain freedom from overlapping internal and external problems in the united states, social workers provide most of the mental health services. according to government sources, 60 percent of mental health professionals are clinically trained social workers, 10 percent are psychiatrists, 23 percent are psychologists, and 5 percent are psychiatric nurses.mental health social workers in japan have professional knowledge of health and welfare and skills essential for persons well-being. their social work training enables them as a professional to carry out consultation assistance for mental disabilities and their social reintegration; consultation regarding the rehabilitation of the victims; advice and guidance for post-discharge residence and re-employment after hospitalized care, for major life events in regular life, money and self-management and other relevant matters to equip them to adapt in daily life. social workers provide individual home visits for mentally ill and do welfare services available, with specialized training a range of procedural services are coordinated for home, workplace and school. in an administrative relationship, psychiatric social workers provides consultation, leadership, conflict management and work direction. psychiatric social workers who provides assessment and psychosocial interventions function as a clinician, counselor and municipal staff of the health centers.unemployment has been shown to hurt an individuals emotional well-being, self-esteem, and more broadly their mental health. increasing unemployment has been shown to have a significant impact on mental health, predominantly depressive disorders. this is an important consideration when reviewing the triggers for mental health disorders in any population survey.emotional mental disorders are a leading cause of disabilities worldwide. investigating the degree and severity of untreated emotional mental disorders throughout the world is a top priority of the world mental health  which was created in 1998 by the world health organization  ""neuropsychiatric disorders are the leading causes of disability worldwide, accounting for 37% of all healthy life years lost through disease.these disorders are most destructive to low and middle-income countries due to their inability to provide their citizens with proper aid. despite modern treatment and rehabilitation for emotional mental health disorders, ""even economically advantaged societies have competing priorities and budgetary constraints"".the world mental health survey initiative has suggested a plan for countries to redesign their mental health care systems to best allocate resources. ""a first step is documentation of services being used and the extent and nature of unmet treatment needs. a second step could be to do a cross-national comparison of service use and unmet needs in countries with different mental health care systems. such comparisons can help to uncover optimum financing, national policies, and delivery systems for mental health care.""knowledge of how to provide effective emotional mental health care has become imperative worldwide. unfortunately, most countries have insufficient data to guide decisions, absent or competing visions for resources, and near-constant pressures to cut insurance and entitlements. wmh surveys were done in africa ""the terms mental health promotion and prevention have often been confused. promotion is defined as intervening to optimize positive mental health by addressing determinants of positive mental health in order to improve your emotional mental health, the root of the issue has to be resolved. ""prevention emphasizes the avoidance of risk factors; promotion aims to enhance an individuals ability to achieve a positive sense of self-esteem, mastery, well-being, and social inclusion."" mental health promotion attempts to increase protective factors and healthy behaviors that can help prevent the onset of a diagnosable mental disorder and reduce risk factors that can lead to the development of a mental disorder. it is very important to improve your emotional mental health by surrounding yourself with positive relationships. we as humans feed off companionships and interactions with other people. another way to improve your emotional mental health is by participating in activities that can allow you to relax and take time for yourself. yoga is a great example of an activity that calms your entire body and nerves. according to a study on well-being by richards, campania, and muse-burke, ""mindfulness is considered to be a purposeful state, it may be that those who practice it belief in its importance and value being mindful, so that valuing of self-care activities may influence the intentional component of mindfulness.""mental health is conventionally defined as a hybrid of absence of a mental disorder and the presence of well-being. focus is increasing on preventing mental disorders.prevention is beginning to appear in mental health strategies, including the 2004 who report ""prevention of mental disorders"", the 2008 eu ""pact for mental health"" and the 2011 us national prevention strategy. some commentators have argued that a pragmatic and practical approach to mental disorder prevention at work would be to treat it the same way as physical injury prevention.prevention of a disorder at a young age may significantly decrease the chances that a child will suffer from a disorder later in life, and shall be the most efficient and effective measure from a public health perspective. prevention may require the regular consultation of a physician for at least twice a year to detect any signs that reveal any mental health concerns. similar to mandated health screenings, bills across the u.s. are being introduced to require mental health screenings for students attending public schools. supporters of these bills hope to diagnose mental illnesses such as anxiety and depression to prevent self-harm and any harm induced on other students.additionally, social media is becoming a resource for prevention. in 2004, the mental health services act began to fund marketing initiatives to educate the public on mental health. this california-based project is working to combat the negative perception with mental health and reduce the stigma associated with it. while social media can benefit mental health, it can also lead to deterioration if not managed properly. limiting social media intake is beneficial .mental health care navigation helps to guide patients and families through the fragmented, often confusing mental health industries. care navigators work closely with patients and families through discussion and collaboration to provide information on best therapies as well as referrals to practitioners and facilities specializing in particular forms of emotional improvement. the difference between therapy and care navigation is that the care navigation process provides information and directs patients to therapy rather than providing therapy. still, care navigators may offer diagnosis and treatment planning. though many care navigators are also trained therapists and doctors. care navigation is the link between the patient and the below therapies. a clear recognition that mental health requires medical intervention was demonstrated in a study by kessler et al. of the prevalence and treatment of mental disorders from 1990 to 2003 in the united states. despite the prevalence of mental health disorders remaining unchanged during this period, the number of patients seeking treatment for mental disorders increased threefold.pharmacotherapy is a therapy that uses pharmaceutical drugs. pharmacotherapy is used in the treatment of mental illness through the use of antidepressants, benzodiazepines, and the use of elements such as lithium.for some people, physical exercise can improve mental as well as physical health. playing sports, walking, cycling, or doing any form of physical activity trigger the production of various hormones, sometimes including endorphins, which can elevate a persons mood.studies have shown that in some cases, physical activity can have the same impact as antidepressants when treating depression and anxiety.moreover, cessation of physical exercise may have adverse effects on some mental health conditions, such as depression and anxiety. this could lead to many different negative outcomes such as obesity, skewed body image, lower levels of certain hormones, and many more health risks associated with mental illnesses.activity therapies also called recreation therapy and occupational therapy, promote healing through active engagement.  making crafts can be a part of occupational therapy.  walks can be a part of recreation therapy.in recent years colouring has been recognised as an activity that has been proven to significantly lower the levels of depressive symptoms and anxiety in many studies.expressive therapies or creative arts therapies are a form of psychotherapy that involves the arts or art-making. these therapies include art therapy, music therapy, drama therapy, dance therapy, and poetry therapy. it has been proven that music therapy is an effective way of helping people who suffer from a mental health disorder. dramatherapy is approved by nice for the treatment of psychosis.psychotherapy is the general term for the scientific based treatment of mental health issues based on modern medicine.  it includes a number of schools, such as gestalt therapy, psychoanalysis, cognitive behavioral therapy, psychedelic therapy, transpersonal psychology/psychotherapy, and dialectical behavioral therapy. group therapy involves any type of therapy that takes place in a setting involving multiple people.  it can include psychodynamic groups, expressive therapy groups, support groups  furthermore, there is evidence from a study by shin & lin suggesting specific components of self-compassion can predict specific dimensions of positive mental health the callaborative for academic, social, emotional learning  a meta-analysis was done by alexendru boncu, iuliana costeau, & mihaela minulescu the practice of mindfulness meditation has several mental health benefits, such as bringing about reductions in depression, anxiety and stress. mindfulness meditation may also be effective in treating substance use disorders. further, mindfulness meditation appears to bring about favorable structural changes in the brain.the heartfulness meditation program has proven to show significant improvements in the state of mind of health-care professionals. a study posted on the us national library of medicine showed that these professionals of varied stress levels were able to improve their conditions after this meditation program was conducted. they benefited in aspects of burnouts and emotional wellness.people with anxiety disorders participated in a stress-reduction program conducted by researchers from the mental health service line at the w.g. hefner veterans affairs medical center in salisbury, north carolina. the participants practiced mindfulness meditation. after the study was over, it was concluded that the ""mindfulness meditation training program can effectively reduce symptoms of anxiety and panic and can help maintain these reductions in patients with generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, or panic disorder with agoraphobia.""mental fitness is a mental health movement that encourages people to intentionally regulate and maintain their emotional wellbeing through friendship, regular human contact, and activities that include meditation, calming exercises, aerobic exercise, mindfulness, having a routine and maintaining adequate sleep. mental fitness is intended to build resilience against every-day mental health challenges to prevent an escalation of anxiety, depression and suicidal ideation, and help them cope with the escalation of those feelings if they occur.spiritual counsellors meet with people in need to offer comfort and support and to help them gain a better understanding of their issues and develop a problem-solving relation with spirituality. these types of counselors deliver care based on spiritual, psychological and theological principles.there are many factors that influence mental health including:emotional mental illnesses should be a particular concern in the united states since the u.s. has the highest annual prevalence rates  while approximately 80 percent of all people in the united states with a mental disorder eventually receive some form of treatment, on the average persons do not access care until nearly a decade following the development of their illness, and less than one-third of people who seek help receive minimally adequate care. the government offers everyone programs and services, but veterans receive the most help, there is certain eligibility criteria that has to be met.the mental health policies in the united states have experienced four major reforms: the american asylum movement led by dorothea dix in 1843; the ""mental hygiene"" movement inspired by clifford beers in 1908; the deinstitutionalization started by action for mental health in 1961; and the community support movement called for by the cmch act amendments of 1975.in 1843, dorothea dix submitted a memorial to the legislature of massachusetts, describing the abusive treatment and horrible conditions received by the mentally ill patients in jails, cages, and almshouses. she revealed in her memorial: ""i proceed, gentlemen, briefly to call your attention to the present state of insane persons confined within this commonwealth, in cages, closets, cellars, stalls, pens! chained, naked, beaten with rods, and lashed into obedience...."" many asylums were built in that period, with high fences or walls separating the patients from other community members and strict rules regarding the entrance and exit. in those asylums, traditional treatments were well implemented: drugs were not used as a cure for a disease, but a way to reset equilibrium in a persons body, along with other essential elements such as healthy diets, fresh air, middle class culture, and the visits by their neighboring residents. in 1866, a recommendation came to the new york state legislature to establish a separate asylum for chronic mentally ill patients. some hospitals placed the chronic patients into separate wings or wards, or different buildings.in a mind that found itself  one year later, the national committee for mental hygiene  however, prevention was not successful, especially for chronic illness; the condemnable conditions in the hospitals were even more prevalent, especially under the pressure of the increasing number of chronically ill and the influence of the depression.in 1961, the joint commission on mental health published a report called action for mental health, whose goal was for community clinic care to take on the burden of prevention and early intervention of the mental illness, therefore to leave space in the hospitals for severe and chronic patients. the court started to rule in favor of the patients will on whether they should be forced to treatment. by 1977, 650 community mental health centers were built to cover 43 percent of the population and serve 1.9 million individuals a year, and the lengths of treatment decreased from 6 months to only 23 days. however, issues still existed. due to inflation, especially in the 1970s, the community nursing homes received less money to support the care and treatment provided. fewer than half of the planned centers were created, and new methods did not fully replace the old approaches to carry out its full capacity of treating power. besides, the community helping system was not fully established to support the patients housing, vocational opportunities, income supports, and other benefits. many patients returned to welfare and criminal justice institutions, and more became homeless. the movement of deinstitutionalization was facing great challenges.after realizing that simply changing the location of mental health care from the state hospitals to nursing houses was insufficient to implement the idea of deinstitutionalization, the national institute of mental health in 1975 created the community support program  later in the 1980s, under the influence from the congress and the supreme court, many programs started to help the patients regain their benefits. a new medicaid service was also established to serve people who were diagnosed with a ""chronic mental illness."" people who were temporally hospitalized were also provided aid and care and a pre-release program was created to enable people to apply for reinstatement prior to discharge. not until 1990, around 35 years after the start of the deinstitutionalization, did the first state hospital begin to close. the number of hospitals dropped from around 300 by over 40 in the 1990s, and finally a report on mental health showed the efficacy of mental health treatment, giving a range of treatments available for patients to choose.however, several critics maintain that deinstitutionalization has, from a mental health point of view, been a thoroughgoing failure. the seriously mentally ill are either homeless, or in prison; in either case the 2011 national prevention strategy included mental and emotional well-being, with recommendations including better parenting and early intervention programs, which increase the likelihood of prevention programs being included in future us mental health policies. the nimh is researching only suicide and hiv/aids prevention, but the national prevention strategy could lead to it focusing more broadly on longitudinal prevention studies.in 2013, united states representative tim murphy introduced the helping families in mental health crisis act, hr2646. the bipartisan bill went through substantial revision and was reintroduced in 2015 by murphy and congresswoman eddie bernice johnson. in november 2015, it passed the health subcommittee by an 18 vote.",1,0

"a balloon is a flexible bag that can be inflated with a gas, such as helium, hydrogen, nitrous oxide, oxygen, and air. for special tasks, balloons can be filled with smoke, liquid water, granular media balloon decoratingballoons are used for decorating birthday parties, weddings, corporate functions, school events, and for other festive gatherings. the artists who use the round balloons to build are called ""stackers"" and the artists who use pencil balloons to build are called ""twisters."" most commonly associated with helium balloon decor, more recently balloon decorators have been moving towards the creation of air-filled balloon decorations due to the non-renewable natural resource of helium limited in supply. the most common types of balloon decor include arches, columns, centerpieces, balloon drops, sculptures, and balloon bouquets. with the increased aptitude for balloon twisting as well as balloon stacking, the rise of the deco-twister manifests itself as the combination of stacking techniques as well as twisting techniques to create unique and interesting balloon decor option.party balloons are mostly made of a natural latex tapped from rubber trees, and can be filled with air, helium, water, or any other suitable liquid or gas. the rubbers elasticity makes the volume adjustable.often the term ""party balloon"" will refer to a twisting balloon or pencil balloon. these balloons are manipulated to create shapes and figures for parties and events, typically along with entertainment.filling the balloon with air can be done with the mouth, a manual or electric inflater balloon artists are entertainers who twist and tie inflated tubular balloons into sculptures such as animals , these tiny tubular balloons are extremely hard to inflate initially. a pump is usually used to inflate these balloons.decorators may use helium balloons to create balloon sculptures. usually the round shape of the balloon restricts these to simple arches or walls, but on occasion more ambitious ""sculptures"" have been attempted. it is also common to use balloons as table decorations for celebratory events. balloons can sometimes be modeled to form shapes of animals. table decorations normally appear with three or five balloons on each bouquet. ribbon is curled and added with a weight to keep the balloons from floating away.a decorative use for balloons is in balloon drops. in a balloon drop, a plastic bag or net filled with air-inflated balloons is suspended from a fixed height. once released, the balloons fall onto their target area below. balloon drops are commonly performed at new years eve celebrations and at political rallies and conventions, but may also be performed at celebrations, including graduations and weddings.for decades, people have also celebrated with balloon releases. this practice has been discouraged by the balloon industry, as it has posed problematic for the environment and cities. in recent years, legislation, such as the california balloon law, has been enacted to enforce consumers and retailers to tether helium-filled foil also in the 1950s at the start of the cold war, activists in western europe uses balloons for propaganda purposes that would float east over eastern europe, which would release newspapers and pamphlets. today, south korean activists are using the same balloon method to get information to those in north korea.paolo scannavino set the record of 11 for the most giant balloons entered in 2 minutes.water balloons are thin, small rubber balloons filled with a liquid, usually water, instead of a gas, and intended to be easily broken. they are usually used by children, who throw them at each other, trying to get each other wet, as a game, competition, or practical joke. by forcing water out the open end of a water balloon, it is possible to use it as a makeshift water gun.solar balloons are thin, large balloons filled with air that is heated by the sun in order to decrease its density to obtain lift.balloons are often deliberately released, creating a so-called balloon rocket. balloon rockets work because the elastic balloons contract on the air within them, and so when the mouth of the balloon is opened, the gas within the balloon is expelled out, and due to newtons third law of motion, the balloon is propelled forward. this is the same way that a rocket works.balloons filled with hot air or a buoyant gas have been used as flying machines since the 18th century. the earliest flights were made with hot air balloons using air heated with a flame, or hydrogen as the lifting gas. later, coal gas and later still helium were used. an unpowered balloon travels with the wind. a balloon which has an engine to propel it is called a dirigible balloon or airship.angioplasty is a surgical procedure in which very small balloons are inserted into blocked or partially blocked blood vessels near the heart. once in place, the balloon is inflated to clear or compress arterial plaque, and to stretch the walls of the vessel, thus preventing myocardial infarction. a small stent can be inserted at the angioplasty site to keep the vessel open after the balloons removal.balloon catheters are catheters that have balloons at their tip to keep them from slipping out. for example, the balloon of a foley catheter is inflated when the catheter is inserted into the urinary bladder and secures its position.insertion of balloons subsequently filled with air or liquid can be used to stop bleeding in hollow internal organs such as stomach or uterus.man has intentionally filled bladders, especially actual animal bladders, with air since prehistory. in ancient greece, these had a number of recorded uses. the aztecs inflated cat intestines to make shapes to present as sacrifices to the gods. by the 18th century, people were inflating balloons of cloth or canvas with hot air and sending it aloft, the montgolfier brothers going to far as to experiment with first animals in 1782, and then when altitude did not kill them, human beings in 1783. the first hydrogen-filled gas balloon was flown in the 1790s. a century later the first hydrogen-filled weather balloons were launched in france.the first modern, rubber balloons on record were made by michael faraday in 1824. he used these to contain gasses he was experimenting with, especially hydrogen. by 1825 similar balloons were being sold by thomas hancock, but like faradays they came disassembled, two circles of soft rubber. the user was expected to lay the circles one on top of the other, then rub their edges until the soft, gummy rubber stuck, leaving the powdered inner part loose for inflation.modern, preassembled balloons were being sold in the us by the early 20th century.there has been some environmental concern over metallised nylon balloons, as they do not biodegrade or shred as rubber balloons do. release of these types of balloons into the atmosphere is considered harmful to the environment. this type of balloon can also conduct electricity on its surface and released foil balloons can become entangled in power lines and cause power outages.released balloons can land anywhere, including on nature reserves or other areas where they can pose a hazard to animals through ingestion or entanglement. because of the potential harm to wildlife and the effect of litter on the environment, some jurisdictions even legislate to control mass balloon releases. legislation proposed in maryland, us, was named after inky, a pygmy sperm whale who needed six operations after swallowing debris, the largest piece of which was a mylar balloon. the balloon council, a trade organization that represents the interests of balloon businesses, claims that there is no documentary evidence to suggest that the death of any sea mammal has been attributed to foil balloons as a sole cause, to date. in the united kingdom, foil balloons sold at major theme parks and zoos have balloon weights attached to help prevent accidental release into the environment.anthony andrady says that releases of latex balloons that descend into the sea pose a serious ingestion and/or entanglement hazard to marine animals because balloons exposed floating in seawater deteriorate much more slowly than those exposed in air. balloon manufacturers will often state that a latex balloon is perfectly safe to release into the environment as it is made from a natural substance and will biodegrade over time. however, a latex balloon can take up to a year to degrade if it lands in the sea and during this time it is possible for a marine animal to ingest the balloon and die from slow starvation if its digestive system is blocked.nabas  publishes guidelines for people holding balloon releases.when balloons eventually return to the ground, they begin the degradation process. latex balloons are the most used because of their ability to biodegrade. the problem with this is that it can take at least 4 weeks to show substantial degradation of the polymer in the environment, and around 6 months in aquatic environments. this issue can have an effect on the wildlife on both land and in aquatic systems because animals will confuse deflated balloons as food, nesting material, or simply something to play with. when that happens, it can lead to negative effects for the animals. for example, a bird will use a deflated balloon as a component for its nest. when the eggs hatch, they will get tangled in the balloon and that can lead to death. another environmental problem with latex balloons is not the effects the balloons have on the environment once they are decomposed, but when they are being made. when latex is being produced, it produces greenhouse gases, such as co2, ch4, n2o. this is becoming an increasing problem, especially in thailand which is responsible for 35% of the worlds natural rubber production.once inflated with regular, atmospheric air, the air inside the balloon will have a greater air pressure than the original atmospheric air pressure.air pressure, technically, is a measurement of the amount of collisions against a surface at any time. in the case of balloon, its supposed to measure how many particles at any in any given time space collide with the wall of the balloon and bounce off. however, since this is near impossible to measure, air pressure seems to be easier described as density. the similarity comes from the idea that when there are more molecules in the same space, more of them will be heading towards a collision course with the wall.the first concept of air pressure within a balloon that is necessary to know is that air pressures ""try"" to even out. with all the bouncing against the balloon wall ""stories behind everyday things""; new york: readers digest, 1980.",1,0
"parachuting is a method of transiting from a high point to earth with the aid of gravity, involving the control of speed during the descent using a parachute or parachutes. it may involve more or less free-falling  the first intentional free-fall jump with a ripcord-operated deployment was not made until over a century later by leslie irvin in 1919. while georgia broadwick made an earlier free-fall in 1914 when her static line became entangled with her jump aircrafts tail assembly, her free-fall descent was not planned. broadwick cut her static line and deployed her parachute manually, only as a means of freeing herself from the aircraft to which she had become entangled.the military developed parachuting as a way to save aircrew from emergencies aboard balloons and aircraft in flight, and later, as a way of delivering soldiers to the battlefield. competitions date back to the 1930s, and it became an international sport in 1952.in world war ii, thousands of combatants across the globe experienced exiting an aircraft and parachuting to the ground, either as a paratrooper dropped into combat or as flight crew escaping a crippled aircraft. some servicemen discovered that it was enjoyable, and after the war ended kept jumping. the national parachute jumpers and riggers was born in 1947. this group would later become the parachute club of america, and finally its current iteration: the uspa in the 1970s sports skydiving became very popular thanks to a quick-release system of the main parachute based on the three rings or rings, designed by engineer bill booth, that allowed anyone to use it.parachuting is performed as a recreational activity and a competitive sport.  its widely considered an extreme sport due to the risks involved. in 2018, there were 3.3 million jumps in the us. modern militaries utilise parachuting for the deployment of airborne forces and supplies. special operations forces commonly employ parachuting, especially free-fall parachuting, as a method of insertion. occasionally, forest firefighters, known as ""smokejumpers"" in the united states, use parachuting as a means of rapidly inserting themselves near forest fires in especially remote or otherwise inaccessible areas.manually exiting an aircraft and parachuting to safety has been widely used by aviators in the us and in most of the western world, skydivers are required to wear two parachutes. the reserve parachute must be periodically inspected and re-packed  some skydivers wear a visual altimeter, and some use audible altimeters fitted to their helmets.injuries and fatalities occurring under a fully functional parachute usually happen because the skydiver performed unsafe maneuvres or made an error in judgement while flying their canopy, typically resulting in a high-speed impact with the ground or other hazards on the ground. one of the most common sources of injury is a low turn under a high-performance canopy and while swooping. swooping is the advanced discipline of gliding at high-speed parallel to the ground during landing.changing wind conditions are another risk factor. in conditions of strong winds and turbulence during hot days, the parachutist can be caught in downdrafts close to the ground. shifting winds can cause a crosswind or downwind landing which have a higher potential for injury due to the wind speed adding to the landing speed.another risk factor is that of ""canopy collisions"", or collisions between two or more skydivers under fully inflated parachutes. canopy collisions can cause the jumpers inflated parachutes to entangle with each other, often resulting in a sudden collapse  ram-air parachutes typically spin uncontrollably when malfunctioning, and must be jettisoned before deploying the reserve parachute.  reserve parachutes are packed and deployed differently; they are also designed more conservatively and built and tested to more exacting standards so they are more reliable than main parachutes, but the real safety advantage comes from the probability of an unlikely main malfunction multiplied by the even less likely probability of a reserve malfunction. this yields an even smaller probability of a double malfunction although the possibility of a main malfunction that cannot be cutaway causing a reserve malfunction is a very real risk.parachuting disciplines such as base jumping or those that involve equipment such as wingsuit flying and sky surfing have a higher risk factor due to the lower mobility of the jumper and the greater risk of entanglement. for this reason, these disciplines are generally practised by experienced jumpers.uspa member drop zones in the us and canada are required to have an experienced jumper act as a ""safety officer"" due to the hazardous nature of skydiving, precautions are taken to avoid parachuting injuries and death. for first time solo-parachutists, this includes anywhere from 4 to 8 hours of ground instruction. since the majority of parachute injuries occur upon landing  the greatest emphasis within ground training is usually on the proper parachute landing fall  as opposed to individual bones, tendons, and ligaments which break and tear more easily.parachutists, especially those flying smaller sport canopies, often land with dangerous amounts of kinetic energy, and for this reason, improper landings are the cause of more than 30% of all skydiving-related injuries and deaths. often, injuries sustained during parachute landing are caused when a single outstretched limb, such as a hand or foot, is extended separately from the rest of the body, causing it to sustain forces disproportional to the support structures within. this tendency is displayed in the accompanying chart, which shows the significantly higher proportion of wrist and ankle injuries among the 186 injured in a 110,000 parachute jump study.due to the possibility of fractures  supportive footwear prevents inward and outward ankle rolling, allowing the plf to safely transfer impact energy through the true ankle joint, and dissipate it via the medial gastrocnemius and tibialis anterior muscles.parachuting in poor weather, especially with thunderstorms, high winds, and dust devils can be a more dangerous activity. reputable drop zones will suspend normal operations during inclement weather. in the united states, the uspas basic safety requirements prohibit solo student skydivers from jumping in winds exceeding 14013, 17% of all skydiving fatalities in the united states resulted from mid-air collisions.skydiving can be practised without jumping. vertical wind tunnels are used to practise for free fall  during a normal deployment, a skydiver will generally experience a few seconds of intense deceleration, in the realm of 3 to 4 g, while the parachute slows the descent from 190,000 and us$3,600, reserve canopies cost between us$1,500 and us$2,500 and aads us$1,000 cost.  higher performance and tandem parachutes cost significantly more, whilst large docile student parachutes often cost less.  most parachuting equipment is ruggedly designed and is enjoyed by several owners before being retired. a rigger is trained to spot signs of damage or misuse. riggers also keep track of industry product and safety bulletins, and can, therefore, determine if a piece of equipment is up-to-date and serviceable.in 1914, while doing demonstrations for the u.s. army, a parachute pioneer named tiny broadwick deployed her chute manually, thus becoming the first person to jump free-fall.according to the guinness book of records, eugene andreev during the late 1950s, captain joseph kittinger of the united states was assigned to the aerospace medical research laboratories at wright-patterson afb in dayton, ohio. for project excelsior  before opening his parachute at 14,000 feet  he set records for highest balloon ascent, highest parachute jump, longest drogue-fall the jumps were made in a ""rocking-chair"" position, descending on his back, rather than the usual arch familiar to skydivers, because he was wearing a 60-pound  kittinger was a member of the mission control and helped design the capsule and suit that baumgartner ascended and jumped in.on 24 october 2014, alan eustace broke the record previously set by baumgartner for the highest fall. he jumped from a height of 135,908 feet a song with various versions of its lyrics, one of which uses as its first line ""he jumped without a parachute from twenty thousand feet"", and includes the line ""they scraped him off the tarmac like a lump of strawberry jam"", has been used as a campfire song by scouts. it is sung to the tune battle hymn of the republic, also known as john browns body.",1,0
"stanford university, officially leland stanford junior university, is a private research university located in stanford, california. stanford was founded in 1885 by leland and jane stanford in memory of their only child, leland stanford jr., who had died of typhoid fever at age 15 the previous year. stanford was a u.s. senator and former governor of california who made his fortune as a railroad tycoon. the school admitted its first students on october 1, 1891, as a coeducational and non-denominational institution.stanford struggled financially after the death of leland stanford in 1893 and again after much of the campus was damaged by the 1906 san francisco earthquake. following world war ii, provost frederick terman supported faculty and graduates entrepreneurialism to build self-sufficient local industry in what would later be known as silicon valley. stanford is today ranked among the top universities in the world by major education publications, and is also one of the top fundraising institutions in the country, becoming the first school to raise more than a billion dollars in a year.the university is organized around seven schools: three schools consisting of 40 academic departments at the undergraduate level as well as four professional schools that focus on graduate programs in law, medicine, education, and business. all schools are on the same campus. students compete in 36 varsity sports, and the university is one of two private institutions in the division i fbs pac-12 conference. it has gained 126 ncaa team championships, and stanford has won the nacda directors cup for 24 consecutive years, beginning in 199470 olympic medals including 139 gold medals.as of october 2020, 84 nobel laureates, 28 turing award laureates, and 8 fields medalists have been affiliated with stanford as students, alumni, faculty, or staff. in addition, stanford university is particularly noted for its entrepreneurship and is one of the most successful universities in attracting funding for start-ups. stanford alumni have founded numerous companies, which combined produce more than $2.7 trillion in annual revenue and have created 5.4 million jobs as of 2011, roughly equivalent to the 7th largest economy in the world . stanford is the alma mater of one president of the united states  it is also one of the leading producers of fulbright scholars, marshall scholars, rhodes scholars, and members of the united states congress.stanford university was founded in 1885 by leland and jane stanford, dedicated to leland stanford jr, their only child. the institution opened in 1891 on stanfords previous palo alto farm. despite being impacted by earthquakes in both 1906 and 1989, the campus was rebuilt each time. in 1919, the hoover institution on

"management  been a movement for evidence-based management.larger organizations generally have three hierarchical levels of managers, in a pyramid structure:in smaller organizations, a manager may have a much wider scope and may perform several roles or even all of the roles commonly observed in a large organization.social scientists study management as an academic discipline, investigating areas such as social organization and organizational leadership.the english verb ""manage"" comes from the italian maneggiare  views on the definition and scope of management include:management involves identifying the mission, objective, procedures, rules and manipulationof the human capital of an enterprise to contribute to the success of the enterprise. scholars have focused on the management of individual, organizational, and inter-organizational relationships. this implies effective communication: an enterprise environment  as such, management is not the manipulation of a mechanism  function in improving ones life and relationships.  management is therefore everywhere and it has a wider range of application. based on this, management must have humans. communication and a positive endeavor are two main aspects of it either through enterprise or through independent pursuit. plans, measurements, motivational psychological tools, goals, and economic measures  this applies even in situations where planning does not take place. from this perspective, henri fayol considers management to consist of five functions:in another way of thinking, mary parker follett she described management as philosophy.critics, however, find this definition useful but far too narrow. the phrase ""management is what managers do"" occurs widely,suggesting the difficulty of defining management without circularity, the shifting nature of definitions and the connection of managerial practices with the existence of a managerial cadre or of a class.one habit of thought regards management as equivalent to ""business administration"" and thus excludes management in places outside commerce, as for example in charities and in the public sector. more broadly, every organization must ""manage"" its work, people, processes, technology, etc. to maximize effectiveness. nonetheless, many people refer to university departments that teach management as ""business schools"". some such institutions historically this use of the term often contrasted with the term ""labor"" 013, a survey of over 160 ceos and directors of public and private companies found that the top weaknesses of ceos were ""mentoring skills"" and ""board engagement"", and 10% of companies never evaluated the ceo. the board may also have certain employees  a broad understanding of competition, world economies, and politics. in addition, the ceo is responsible for implementing and determining  accounting, corporate finance, entertainment, global management, healthcare management, investment management, sustainability and real estate.a master of business administration  human resources finds itself increasingly working with management in a training capacity to help collect management data on the success evidence-based management is an emerging movement to use the current, best evidence in management and decision-making. it is part of the larger movement towards evidence-based practices. evidence-based management entails managerial decisions and organizational practices informed by the best available evidence. as with other evidence-based practice, this is based on the three principles of: 1 published peer-reviewed some see management as a late-modern  on those terms it cannot have a pre-modern history 00 pins per day, smith analyzed the steps involved in manufacture and, with 10 specialists, enabled production of 48,000 pins per day.classical economists such as adam smith before wage slavery eclipsed chattel slavery.salaried managers as an identifiable group first became prominent in the late 19th century. as large corporations began to overshadow small family businesses the need for personnel management positions became more necessary. businesses grew into large corporations and the need for clerks, bookkeepers, secretaries and managers expanded. the demand for trained managers led college and university administrators to consider and move forward with plans to create the first schools of business on their campuses.at the turn of the twentieth century the need for skilled and trained managers had become increasingly apparent. the demand occurred as personnel departments began to expand rapidly. in 1915, less than one in twenty manufacturing firms had a dedicated personnel department. by 1929 that number had grown to over one-third. formal management education became standardized at colleges and universities. colleges and universities capitalized on the needs of corporations by forming business schools and corporate placement departments. this shift toward formal business education marked the creation of a corporate elite in the us.by about 1900 one finds managers trying to place their theories on what they regarded as a thoroughly scientific basis  frank and lillian gilbreths applied motion study  the harvard business school offered the first master of business administration degree  rensis likert  in the 21st century observers find it increasingly difficult to subdivide management into functional categories in this way. more and more processes simultaneously involve several categories. instead, one tends to think in terms of the various processes, tasks, and objects subject to management.branches of management theory also exist relating to nonprofits and to government: such as public administration, public management, and educational management. further, management programs related to civil-society organizations have also spawned programs in nonprofit management and social entrepreneurship.note that many of the assumptions made by management have come under attack from business-ethics viewpoints, critical management studies, and anti-corporate activism.as one consequence, workplace democracy  layoffs have been conducted with management ranks affected far less than employees at the lower levels. in some cases, management has even rewarded itself with bonuses after laying off lower-level workers.according to leadership-academic manfred f.r. kets de vries, a contemporary senior-management team will almost inevitably have some personality disorders.in profitable organizations, managements primary function is the satisfaction of a range of stakeholders. this typically involves making a profit (for the shareholders, creating valued products at a reasonable cost (for customers, and providing great employment opportunities for employees. in nonprofit management, add the importance of keeping the faith of donors. in most models of management and governance, shareholders vote for the board of directors, and the board then hires senior management. some organizations have experimented with other methods (such as employee-voting models of selecting or reviewing managers, but this is rare.according to fayol, management operates through five basic functions: planning, organizing, coordinating, commanding, and controlling.figurehead, leadernerve centre, disseminatorentrepreneur, negotiator, allocatormanagement skills include:",1,0
"moby-dick; or, the whale is an 1851 novel by american writer herman melville. the book is the sailor ishmaels narrative of the obsessive quest of ahab, captain of the whaling ship pequod, for revenge on moby dick, the giant white sperm whale that on the ships previous voyage bit off ahabs leg at the knee. a contribution to the literature of the american renaissance, moby-dick was published to mixed reviews, was a commercial failure, and was out of print at the time of the authors death in 1891. its reputation as a ""great american novel"" was established only in the 20th century, after the centennial of its authors birth. william faulkner said he wished he had written the book himself, and d. h. lawrence called it ""one of the strangest and most wonderful books in the world"" and ""the greatest book of the sea ever written"". its opening sentence, ""call me ishmael"", is among world literatures most famous.melville began writing moby-dick in february 1850, and finished 18 months later, a year longer than he had anticipated. melville drew on his experience as a common sailor from 1841 to 1844, including several years on whalers, and on wide reading in whaling literature. the white whale is modeled on the notoriously hard-to-catch albino whale mocha dick, and the books ending is based on the sinking of the whaleship essex in 1820. his literary influences include shakespeare and the bible. the detailed and realistic descriptions of whale hunting and of extracting whale oil, as well as life aboard ship among a culturally diverse crew, are mixed with exploration of class and social status, good and evil, and the existence of god. in addition to narrative prose, melville uses styles and literary devices ranging from songs, poetry, and catalogs to shakespearean stage directions, soliloquies, and asides. in august 1850, with the manuscript perhaps half finished, he met nathaniel hawthorne and was deeply moved by his mosses from an old manse, which he compared to shakespeare in its cosmic ambitions. this encounter may have inspired him to revise and expand moby-dick, which is dedicated to hawthorne, ""in token of my admiration for his genius"".the book was first published  reviewers in britain were largely favorable, though some objected that the tale seemed to be told by a narrator who perished with the ship, as the british edition lacked the epilogue recounting ishmaels survival. american reviewers were more hostile. about 3,200 copies of the book were sold during the authors life.ishmael travels in december from manhattan island to new bedford, massachusetts, with plans to sign up for a whaling voyage. the inn where he arrives is overcrowded, so he must share a bed with the tattooed cannibal polynesian queequeg, a harpooneer whose father was king of the fictional island of rokovoko. the next morning, ishmael and queequeg attend father mapples sermon on jonah, then head for nantucket. ishmael signs up with the quaker ship-owners bildad and peleg for a voyage on their whaler pequod. peleg describes captain ahab: ""hes a grand, ungodly, god-like man"" who nevertheless ""has his humanities"". they hire queequeg the following morning. a man named elijah prophesies a dire fate should ishmael and queequeg join ahab. while provisions are loaded, shadowy figures board the ship. on a cold christmas day, the pequod leaves the harbor.ishmael discusses cetology  repeatedly, ishmael refers to his writing of the book: ""but how can i hope to explain myself here; and yet, in some dim, random way, explain myself i must, else all these chapters might be naught."" scholar john bryant calls him the novels ""central consciousness and narrative voice."" walter bezanson  first distinguishes ishmael as narrator from ishmael as character, whom he calls ""forecastle ishmael"", the younger ishmael of some years ago. narrator ishmael, then, is ""merely young ishmael grown older."" a second distinction avoids confusion of either of both ishmaels with the author herman melville. bezanson warns readers to ""resist any one-to-one equation of melville and ishmael.""according to critic walter bezanson, the chapter structure can be divided into ""chapter sequences"", ""chapter clusters"", and ""balancing chapters"". the simplest sequences are of narrative progression, then sequences of theme such as the three chapters on whale painting, and sequences of structural similarity, such as the five dramatic chapters beginning with ""the quarter-deck"" or the four chapters beginning with ""the candles"". chapter clusters are the chapters on the significance of the colour white, and those on the meaning of fire. balancing chapters are chapters of opposites, such as ""loomings"" versus the ""epilogue,"" or similars, such as ""the quarter-deck"" and ""the candles"".scholar lawrence buell describes the arrangement of the non-narrative chapters as structured around three patterns: first, the nine meetings of the pequod with ships that have encountered moby dick. each has been more and more severely damaged, foreshadowing the pequods own fate. second, the increasingly impressive encounters with whales. in the early encounters, the whaleboats hardly make contact; later there are false alarms and routine chases; finally, the massive assembling of whales at the edges of the china sea in ""the grand armada"". a typhoon near japan sets the stage for ahabs confrontation with moby dick.the third pattern is the cetological documentation, so lavish that it can be divided into two subpatterns. these chapters start with the ancient history of whaling and a bibliographical classification of whales, getting closer with second-hand stories of the evil of whales in general and of moby dick in particular, a chronologically ordered commentary on pictures of whales. the climax to this section is chapter 57, ""of whales in paint etc."", which begins with the humble some ""ten or more"" of the chapters on whale killings, beginning at two-fifths of the book, are developed enough to be called ""events"". as bezanson writes, ""in each case a killing provokes either a chapter sequence or a chapter cluster of cetological lore growing out of the circumstance of the particular killing,"" thus these killings are ""structural occasions for ordering the whaling essays and sermons"".buell observes that the ""narrative architecture"" is an ""idiosyncratic variant of the bipolar observer/hero narrative"", that is, the novel is structured around the two main characters, ahab and ishmael, who are intertwined and contrasted with each other, with ishmael the observer and narrator. as the story of ishmael, remarks robert milder, it is a ""narrative of education"".bryant and springer find that the book is structured around the two consciousnesses of ahab and ishmael, with ahab as a force of linearity and ishmael a force of digression. while both have an angry sense of being orphaned, they try to come to terms with this hole in their beings in different ways: ahab with violence, ishmael with meditation. and while the plot in moby-dick may be driven by ahabs anger, ishmaels desire to get a hold of the ""ungraspable"" accounts for the novels lyricism. buell sees a double quest in the book: ahabs is to hunt moby dick, ishmaels is ""to understand what to make of both whale and hunt"".one of the most distinctive features of the book is the variety of genres. bezanson mentions sermons, dreams, travel account, autobiography, elizabethan plays, and epic poetry. he calls ishmaels explanatory footnotes to establish the documentary genre ""a nabokovian touch"".a significant structural device is the series of nine meetings bezanson sees no single way to account for the meaning of all of these ships. instead, they may be interpreted as ""a group of metaphysical parables, a series of biblical analogues, a masque of the situation confronting man, a pageant of the humors within men, a parade of the nations, and so forth, as well as concrete and symbolic ways of thinking about the white whale"".scholar nathalia wright sees the meetings and the significance of the vessels along other lines. she singles out the four vessels which have already encountered moby dick. the first, the jeroboam, is named after the predecessor of the biblical king ahab. her ""prophetic"" fate is ""a message of warning to all who follow, articulated by gabriel and vindicated by the samuel enderby, the rachel, the delight, and at last the pequod"". none of the other ships has been completely destroyed because none of their captains shared ahabs monomania; the fate of the jeroboam reinforces the structural parallel between ahab and his biblical namesake: ""ahab did more to provoke the lord god of israel to anger than all the kings of israel that were before him"" an early enthusiast for the melville revival, british author e.7: ""moby-dick is full of meanings: its meaning is a different problem."" yet he saw as ""the essential"" in the book ""its prophetic song"", which flows ""like an undercurrent"" beneath the surface action and morality.biographer laurie robertson-lorant sees epistemology as the books theme. ishmaels taxonomy of whales merely demonstrates ""the limitations of scientific knowledge and the impossibility of achieving certainty"". she also contrasts ishmael and ahabs attitudes toward life, with ishmaels open-minded and meditative, ""polypositional stance"" as antithetical to ahabs monomania, adhering to dogmatic rigidity.melville biographer andrew delbanco cites race as an example of this search for truth beneath surface differences. all races are represented among the crew members of the pequod. although ishmael initially is afraid of queequeg as a tattooed cannibal, he soon decides, ""better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken christian."" while it may be rare for a mid-19th century american book to feature black characters in a nonslavery context, slavery is frequently mentioned. the theme of race is primarily carried by pip, the diminutive black cabin boy. when pip has almost drowned, ahab, genuinely touched by pips suffering, questions him gently, pip ""can only parrot the language of an advertisement for the return of a fugitive slave: pip! reward for pip!"".editors bryant and springer suggest perception is a central theme, the difficulty of seeing and understanding, which makes deep reality hard to discover and truth hard to pin down. ahab explains that, like all things, the evil whale wears a disguise: ""all visible objects, man, are but pasteboard masks""  months. its owner, melvin o. bradford, like bildad, was a quaker: on several instances when he signed documents, he erased the word ""swear"" and replaced it with ""affirm"". but the shareholders of the acushnet were relatively wealthy, whereas the owners of the pequod included poor widows and orphaned children.the model for the whalemans chapel of chapter 7 is the seamens bethel on johnny cake hill. melville attended a service there shortly before he shipped out on the acushnet, and he heard a sermon by reverend enoch mudge, who is at least in part the inspiration for father mapple. even the topic of jonah and the whale may be authentic, for mudge contributed sermons on jonah to sailors magazine the crew was not as heterogenous or exotic as the crew of the pequod. five were foreigners, four of them portuguese, and the others were american either at birth or naturalized. three black men were in the crew, two seamen and the cook. fleece, the black cook of the pequod, was probably modeled on this philadelphia-born william maiden. a first mate, actually called edward c. starbuck was discharged at tahiti under mysterious circumstances. the second mate, john hall, is identified as stubb in an annotation in the books copy of crew member henry hubbard, who also identified the model for pip: john backus, a little black man added to the crew during the voyage. hubbard witnessed pips fall into the water. ahab seems to have had no model, though his death may have been based on an actual event. melville was aboard the star in may 1843 with two sailors from the nantucket who could have told him that they had seen their second mate ""taken out of a whaleboat by a foul line and drowned"".in addition to his own experience on the whaling ship acushnet, two actual events served as the genesis for melvilles tale. one was the sinking of the nantucket ship essex in 1820, after a sperm whale rammed her 2,000 miles the other event was the alleged killing in the late 1830s of the albino sperm whale mocha dick, in the waters off the chilean island of mocha. mocha dick was rumored to have 20 or so harpoons in his back from other whalers, and appeared to attack ships with premeditated ferocity. one of his battles with a whaler served as subject for an article by explorer jeremiah n. reynolds in the may 1839 issue of the knickerbocker or new-york monthly magazine. melville was familiar with the article, which described:  this renowned monster, who had come off victorious in a hundred fights with his pursuers, was an old bull whale, of prodigious size and strength. from the effect of age, or more probably from a freak of nature ... a singular consequence had resulted , and one incident in particular, now served as inspiration. during a mid-ocean ""gam"" . this was the first printed account of it i had ever seen. the reading of this wondrous story on the landless sea, and so close to the very latitude of the shipwreck, had a surprising effect upon me.the book was out of print, and rare. melville let his interest in the book be known to his father-in-law, lemuel shaw, whose friend in nantucket procured an imperfect but clean copy which shaw gave to melville in april 1851. melville read this copy avidly, made copious notes in it, and had it bound, keeping it in his library for the rest of his life. moby-dick contains large sections7 to richard bentley, his english publisher:my dear sir, 4. bezanson finds the essay ""so deeply related to melvilles imaginative and intellectual world while writing moby-dick"" that it could be regarded as a virtual preface and should be ""everybodys prime piece of contextual reading"". in the essay, melville compares hawthorne to shakespeare and dante, and his ""self-projection"" is evident in the repeats of the word ""genius"", the more than two dozen references to shakespeare, and in the insistence that shakespeares ""unapproachability"" is nonsense for an american.the most intense work on the book was done during the winter of 18505th year: ""three weeks have scarcely passed, at any time between then and now, that i have not unfolded within myself. but i feel that i am now come to the inmost leaf of the bulb, and that shortly the flower must fall to the mould.""buell finds the evidence that melville changed his ambitions during writing ""on the whole convincing"", since the impact of shakespeare and hawthorne was ""surely monumental"", but others challenge the theories of the composition in three ways. the first raises objections on the use of evidence and the evidence itself. bryant finds ""little concrete evidence, and nothing at all conclusive, to show that melville radically altered the structure or conception of the book"". and scholar robert milder sees ""insufficient evidence and doubtful methodology"" at work.  a second type of objection is based on assumptions about melvilles intellectual development. bryant and springer object to the conclusion that hawthorne inspired melville to write ahabs tragic obsession into the book; melville already had experienced other encounters which could just as well have triggered his imagination, such as the bibles jonah and job, miltons satan, shakespeares king lear, byrons heroes.  bezanson is also not convinced that before he met hawthorne, ""melville was not ready for the kind of book moby-dick became"", because in his letters from the time melville denounces his last two ""straight narratives, redburn and white-jacket, as two books written just for the money, and he firmly stood by mardi as the kind of book he believed in. his language is already ""richly steeped in 17th-century mannerisms"", characteristics of moby-dick. a third type calls upon the literary nature of passages used as evidence. according to milder, the cetological chapters cannot be leftovers from an earlier stage of composition and any theory that they are ""will eventually founder on the stubborn meaningfulness of these chapters"", because no scholar adhering to the theory has yet explained how these chapters ""can bear intimate thematic relation to a symbolic story not yet conceived"".buell finds that theories based on a combination of selected passages from letters and what are perceived as ""loose ends"" in the book not only ""tend to dissolve into guesswork"", but he also suggests that these so-called loose ends may be intended by the author: repeatedly the book mentions ""the necessary unfinishedness of immense endeavors"".melville first proposed the british publication in a june 27, 1850 letter to richard bentley, london publisher of his earlier works. textual scholar g. thomas tanselle explains that for these earlier books, american proof sheets had been sent to the british publisher and that publication in the united states had been held off until the work had been set in type and published in england. this procedure was intended to provide the best  in the case of moby-dick, melville had taken almost a year longer than promised, and could not rely on harpers to prepare the proofs as they had done for the earlier books. indeed, harpers had denied him an advance, and since he was already in debt to them for almost $700, he was forced to borrow money and to arrange for the typesetting and plating himself. john bryant suggests that he did so ""to reduce the number of hands playing with his text"".the final stages of composition overlapped with the early stages of publication. in june 1851, melville wrote to hawthorne that he was in new york to ""work and slave on my whale while it is driving through the press"". by the end of the month, ""wearied with the long delay of printers"", melville came back to finish work on the book in pittsfield. three weeks later, the typesetting was almost done, as he announced to bentley on july 20: ""i am now passing thro the press, the closing sheets of my new work"". while melville was simultaneously writing and proofreading what had been set, the corrected proof would be plated, that is, the type fixed in final form. since earlier chapters were already plated when he was revising the later ones, melville must have ""felt restricted in the kinds of revisions that were feasible"".on july 3, 1851, bentley offered melville 0, melville accepted, after which bentley drew up a contract on august 13. melville signed and returned the contract in early september, and then went to new york with the proof sheets, made from the finished plates, which he sent to london by his brother allan on september 10. for over a month, these proofs had been in melvilles possession, and because the book would be set anew in london he could devote all his time to correcting and revising them. he still had no american publisher, so the usual hurry about getting the british publication to precede the american was not present. only on september 12 was the harper publishing contract signed. bentley received the proof sheets with melvilles corrections and revisions marked on them on september 24. he published the book less than four weeks later.in the october 1851 issue of harpers new monthly magazine ""the town hos story"" was published, with a footnote reading: ""from the whale. the title of a new work by mr. melville, in the press of harper and brothers, and now publishing in london by mr. bentley.""on october 18, the british edition, the whale, was published in a printing of only 500 copies, fewer than melvilles previous books. their slow sales had convinced bentley that a smaller number was more realistic. the london morning herald on october 20 printed the earliest known review. on november 14, the american edition, moby-dick, was published and the same day reviewed in both the albany argus and the morning courier and new-york enquirer. on november 19, washington received the copy to be deposited for copyright purposes. the first american printing of 2,915 copies was almost the same as the first of mardi, but the first printing of melvilles other three harper books had been a thousand copies more.the british edition, set by bentleys printers from the american page proofs with melvilles revisions and corrections, differs from the american edition in over 700 wordings and thousands of punctuation and spelling changes.excluding the preliminaries and the one extract, the three volumes of the british edition came to 927 pages and the single american volume to 635 pages. accordingly, the dedication to hawthorne in the american edition , some remaining sheets were bound in a cheaper casing, and in 1853, enough sheets were still left to issue a cheap edition in one volume. bentley recovered only half on the ,915 copies, including the standard 125 review copies. the selling price was $1.50, about a fifth of the price of the british three-volume edition.about 1,500 copies were sold within 11 days, and then sales slowed down to less than 300 the next year. after three years, the first edition was still available, almost 300 copies of which were lost when a fire broke out at the firm in december 1853. in 1855, a second printing of 250 copies was issued, in 1863, a third of 253 copies, and finally in 1871, a fourth printing of 277 copies, which sold so slowly that no new printing was ordered. moby-dick was out of print during the last four years of melvilles life, having sold 2,300 in its first year and a half and on average 27 copies a year for the next 34 years, totaling 3,215 copies.melvilles earnings from the book add up to $1,260: the  and 1898.the reception of the whale in britain and of moby-dick in the united states differed in two ways, according to parker. first, british literary criticism was more sophisticated and developed than in the still-young republic, with british reviewing done by ""cadres of brilliant literary people"" who were ""experienced critics and trenchant prose stylists"", while the united states had only ""a handful of reviewers"" capable enough to be called critics, and american editors and reviewers habitually echoed british opinion. american reviewing was mostly delegated to ""newspaper staffers"" or else by ""amateur contributors more noted for religious piety than critical acumen."" second, the differences between the two editions caused ""two distinct critical receptions.""twenty-one reviews appeared in london, and later one in dublin. the british reviewers, according to parker, mostly regarded the whale as ""a phenomenal literary work, a philosophical, metaphysical, and poetic romance"". the morning advertiser for october 24 was in awe of melvilles learning, of his ""dramatic ability for producing a prose poem"", and of the whale adventures which were ""powerful in their cumulated horrors."" to its surprise, john bull found ""philosophy in whales"" and ""poetry in blubber"", and concluded that few books that claimed to be either philosophical or literary works ""contain as much true philosophy and as much genuine poetry as the tale of the pequods whaling expedition"", making it a work ""far beyond the level of an ordinary work of fiction"". the morning post found it ""one of the cleverest, wittiest, and most amusing of modern books"", and predicted that it was a book ""which will do great things for the literary reputation of its author"".melville himself never saw these reviews, and parker calls it a ""bitter irony"" that the reception overseas was ""all he could possibly have hoped for, short of a few conspicuous proclamations that the distance between him and shakespeare was by no means immeasurable.""one of the earliest reviews, by the extremely conservative critic henry chorley in the highly regarded london athenaeum, described it as n ill-compounded mixture of romance and matter-of-fact. the idea of a connected and collected story has obviously visited and abandoned its writer again and again in the course of composition. the style of his tale is in places disfigured by mad  most critics regretted the extravagant digressions because they distracted from an otherwise interesting and even exciting narrative, but even critics who did not like the book as a whole praised melvilles originality of imagination and expression.because the english edition omitted the epilogue describing ishmaels escape, british reviewers read a book with a first-person narrator who apparently did not survive. the reviewer of the literary gazette asked how ishmael, ""who appears to have been drowned with the rest, communicated his notes to mr. bentley"". the reviewer in the spectator objected that ""nothing should be introduced into a novel which it is physically impossible for the writer to have known: thus, he must not describe the conversation of miners in a pit if they all perish."" the dublin university magazine asked ""how does it happen that the author is alive to tell the story?""  a few other reviewers, who did not comment upon the apparent impossibility of ishmael telling the story, pointed out violations of narrative conventions in other passages.other reviewers accepted the flaws they perceived. john bull praised the author for making literature out of unlikely and even unattractive matter, and the morning post found that delight far outstripped the improbable character of events. though some reviewers viewed the characters, especially ahab, as exaggerated, others felt that it took an extraordinary character to undertake the battle with the white whale. melvilles style was often praised, although some found it excessive or too american.some sixty reviews appeared in america, the criterion for counting as a review being more than two lines of comment. only a couple of reviewers expressed themselves early enough not to be influenced by news of the british reception. though moby-dick did contain the epilogue and so accounted for ishmaels survival, the british reviews influenced the american reception. the earliest american review, in the boston post for november 20, quoted the london athenaeums scornful review, not realizing that some of the criticism of the whale did not pertain to moby-dick. this last point, and the authority and influence of british criticism in american reviewing, is clear from the reviews opening: ""we have read nearly one half of this book, and are satisfied that the london athenaeum is right in calling it an ill-compounded mixture of romance and matter-of-fact"". though the post quoted the greater portion of the review, it omitted the condensed extract of melvilles prose the athenaeum had included to give readers an example of it. the post deemed the price of one dollar and fifty cents far too much: ""the whale is not worth the money asked for it, either as a literary work or as a mass of printed paper"".the new york north american miscellany for december summarized the verdict in the athenaeum. the reviewer of the december new york eclectic magazine had actually read moby-dick in full, and was puzzled why the athenaeum was so scornful of the ending. the attack on the whale by the spectator was reprinted in the december new york international magazine, which inaugurated the influence of another unfavorable review. rounding off what american readers were told about the british reception, in january harpers monthly magazine attempted some damage control, and wrote that the book had ""excited a general interest"" among the london magazines.the most influential american review, ranked according to the number of references to it, appeared in the weekly magazine literary world, which had printed melvilles ""mosses"" essay the preceding year. the author of the unsigned review in two installments, on november 15 and 22, was later identified as publisher evert duyckinck. the first half of the first installment was devoted to an event of remarkable coincidence: early in the month, between the publishing of the british and the american edition, a whale had sunk the new bedford whaler ann alexander near chile.in the second installment, duyckinck described moby-dick as three books rolled into one: he was pleased with the book as far as it was a thorough account of the sperm whale, less so with it as far as the adventures of the pequod crew were considered, perceiving the characters as unrealistic and expressing inappropriate opinions on religions, and condemned the essayistic rhapsodizing and moralizing with what he thought was little respect of what ""must be to the world the most sacred associations of life violated and defaced."" the review prompted hawthorne to take the ""unusually aggressive step of reproving duyckinck"" by criticizing the review in a letter to duyckinck of december 1:what a book melville has written! it gives me an idea of much greater power than his preceding ones. it hardly seemed to me that the review of it, in the literary world, did justice to its best points.the  transcendental socialist george ripley published a review in the new york tribune for november 22, in which he compared the book favorably to mardi, because the ""occasional touches of the subtle mysticism"" was not carried on to excess but kept within boundaries by the solid realism of the whaling context. ripley was almost surely also the author of the review in harpers for december, which saw in ahabs quest the ""slight framework"" for something else: ""beneath the whole story, the subtle, imaginative reader may perhaps find a pregnant allegory, intended to illustrate the mystery of human life."" among the handful of other favorable reviews was one in the albion on november 22 which saw the book as a blend of truth and satire.melvilles friend nathaniel parker willis, reviewing the book in november 29 home journal, found it ""a very racy, spirited, curious and entertaining book ... it enlists the curiosity, excites the sympathies, and often charms the fancy"". in december 6 spirit of the times, editor william t. porter praised the book, and all of melvilles five earlier works, as the writings ""of a man who is at once philosopher, painter, and poet"". some other, shorter reviews mixed their praise with genuine reservations about the ""irreverence and profane jesting"", as the new haven daily palladium for november 17 phrased it. many reviewers, parker observes, had come to the conclusion that melville was capable of producing enjoyable romances, but they could not see in him the author of great literature.within a year after melvilles death in 1891, moby-dick, along with typee, omoo, and mardi, was reprinted by harper & brothers, giving it a chance to be rediscovered. however, only new yorks literary underground showed interest, just enough to keep melvilles name circulating for the next 25 years in the capital of american publishing. during this time, a few critics were willing to devote time, space, and a modicum of praise to melville and his works, or at least those that could still be easily obtained or remembered. other works, especially the poetry, went largely forgotten.in 1917, american author carl van doren became the first of this period to proselytize about melvilles value in his 1921 study, the american novel, calling moby-dick a pinnacle of american romanticism.in his 1923 idiosyncratic but influential studies in classic american literature, novelist, poet, and short story writer d. h. lawrence celebrated the originality and value of american authors, among them melville. perhaps surprisingly, lawrence saw moby-dick as a work of the first order despite his using the expurgated original english edition which also lacked the epilogue.the modern library brought out moby-dick in 1926 and the lakeside press in chicago commissioned rockwell kent to design and illustrate a striking three-volume edition which appeared in 1930. random house then issued a one-volume trade version of kents edition, which in 1943 they reprinted as a less expensive modern library giant.the novel has been adapted or represented in art, film, books, cartoons, television, and more than a dozen versions in comic-book format. the first adaptation was the 1926 silent movie the sea beast, starring john barrymore, in which ahab returns to marry his fianc novel invisible man. the narrator remembers a moment of truth under the influence of marijuana and evokes a church service: ""brothers and sisters, my text this morning is the blackness of blackness. and the congregation answers: that blackness is most black, brother, most black017 cited moby-dick as one of the three books that influenced him most. dylans description  ends with an acknowledgment: ""that theme, and all that it implies, would work its way into more than a few of my songs.""",1,0

"amphicynodontinaehemicyoninaeursavinaeagriotheriinaeailuropodinaetremarctinaeursinaebears are carnivoran mammals of the family ursidae. they are classified as caniforms, or doglike carnivorans.  although only eight species of bears are extant, they are widespread, appearing in a wide variety of habitats throughout the northern hemisphere and partially in the southern hemisphere. bears are found on the continents of north america, south america, europe, and asia. common characteristics of modern bears include large bodies with stocky legs, long snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair, plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws, and short tails.while the polar bear is mostly carnivorous, and the giant panda feeds almost entirely on bamboo, the remaining six species are omnivorous with varied diets. with the exception of courting individuals and mothers with their young, bears are typically solitary animals. they may be diurnal or nocturnal and have an excellent sense of smell. despite their heavy build and awkward gait, they are adept runners, climbers, and swimmers.  bears use shelters, such as caves and logs, as their dens; most species occupy their dens during the winter for a long period of hibernation, up to 100 days.bears have been hunted since prehistoric times for their meat and fur; they have been used for bear-baiting and other forms of entertainment, such as being made to dance. with their powerful physical presence, they play a prominent role in the arts, mythology, and other cultural aspects of various human societies. in modern times, bears have come under pressure through encroachment on their habitats and illegal trade in bear parts, including the asian bile bear market. the iucn lists six bear species as vulnerable or endangered, and even least concern species, such as the brown bear, are at risk of extirpation in certain countries. the poaching and international trade of these most threatened populations are prohibited, but still ongoing.the english word ""bear"" comes from old english bera and belongs to a family of names for the bear in germanic languages, such as swedish bj  as do the names ""arctic"" and ""antarctic"", via the name of the constellation ursa major, the ""great bear"", prominent in the northern sky.bear taxon names such as ursidae and ursus come from latin ursus/ursa, he-bear/she-bear. the female first name ""ursula"", originally derived from a christian saints name, means ""little she-bear""  the old english name beowulf is a kenning, ""bee-wolf"",  for bear, in turn meaning a brave warrior.the family ursidae is one of nine families in the suborder caniformia, or ""doglike"" carnivorans, within the order carnivora. bears closest living relatives are the pinnipeds, canids, and musteloids. modern bears comprise eight species in three subfamilies: ailuropodinae the earliest members of ursidae belong to the extinct subfamily amphicynodontinae, including parictis  it is unclear whether late-eocene ursids were also present in eurasia, although faunal exchange across the bering land bridge may have been possible during a major sea level low stand as early as the late eocene  european genera morphologically very similar to allocyon, and to the much younger american kolponomos  are known from the oligocene, including amphicticeps and amphicynodon. there has been various morphological evidence linking amphicynodontines with pinnipeds, as both groups were semi-aquatic, otter-like mammals. in addition to the support of the pinniped005.feliformia canidae 53.1.25 years.bears of northern regions, including the american black bear and the grizzly bear, hibernate in the winter. during hibernation, the bears metabolism slows down, its body temperature decreases slightly, and its heart rate slows from a normal value of 55 to just 9 beats per minute. bears normally do not wake during their hibernation, and can go the entire period without eating, drinking, urinating, or defecating. a fecal plug is formed in the colon, and is expelled when the bear wakes in the spring. if they have stored enough body fat, their muscles remain in good condition, and their protein maintenance requirements are met from recycling waste urea. female bears give birth during the hibernation period, and are roused when doing so.bears do not have many predators. the most important are humans, and as they started cultivating crops, they increasingly came in conflict with the bears that raided them. since the invention of firearms, people have been able to kill bears with greater ease. felids like the tiger may also prey on bears, particularly cubs, which may also be threatened by canids.bears are parasitized by eighty species of parasites, including single-celled protozoans and gastro-intestinal worms, and nematodes and flukes in their heart, liver, lungs and bloodstream. externally they have ticks, fleas and lice. a study of american black bears found seventeen species of endoparasite including the protozoan sarcocystis, the parasitic worm diphyllobothrium mansonoides, and the nematodes dirofilaria immitis, capillaria aerophila, physaloptera sp., strongyloides sp. and others. of these, d. mansonoides and adult c. aerophila were causing pathological symptoms. by contrast, polar bears have few parasites; many parasitic species need a secondary, usually terrestrial, host, and the polar bears life style is such that few alternative hosts exist in their environment. the protozoan toxoplasma gondii has been found in polar bears, and the nematode trichinella nativa can cause a serious infection and decline in older polar bears. bears in north america are sometimes infected by a morbillivirus similar to the canine distemper virus. they are susceptible to infectious canine hepatitis in modern times, bears have come under pressure through encroachment on their habitats and illegal trade in bear parts, including the asian bile bear market, though hunting is now banned, largely replaced by farming. the iucn lists six bear species as vulnerable; even the two least concern species, the brown bear and the american black bear, are at risk of extirpation in certain areas. in general these two species inhabit remote areas with little interaction with humans, and the main non-natural causes of mortality are hunting, trapping, road-kill and depredation.laws have been passed in many areas of the world to protect bears from habitat destruction. public perception of bears is often positive, as people identify with bears due to their omnivorous diets, their ability to stand on two legs, and their symbolic importance. support for bear protection is widespread, at least in more affluent societies. the giant panda has become a worldwide symbol of conservation. the sichuan giant panda sanctuaries, which are home to around 30% of the wild panda population, gained a unesco world heritage site designation in 2006. where bears raid crops or attack livestock, they may come into conflict with humans. in poorer rural regions, attitudes may be more shaped by the dangers posed by bears, and the economic costs they cause to farmers and ranchers.several bear species are dangerous to humans, especially in areas where they have become used to people; elsewhere, they generally avoid humans. injuries caused by bears are rare, but are widely reported. bears may attack humans in response to being startled, in defense of young or food, or even for predatory reasons.bears in captivity have for centuries been used for entertainment. they have been trained to dance, and were kept for baiting in europe at least since the 16th century. there were five bear-baiting gardens in southwark, london at that time; archaeological remains of three of these have survived. across europe, nomadic romani bear handlers called ursari lived by busking with their bears from the 12th century.bears have been hunted for sport, food, and folk medicine. their meat is dark and stringy, like a tough cut of beef. in cantonese cuisine, bear paws are considered a delicacy. bear meat should be cooked thoroughly, as it can be infected with the parasite trichinella spiralis.the peoples of eastern asia use bears body parts and secretions bears have been popular subjects in art, literature, folklore and mythology. the image of the mother bear was prevalent throughout societies in north america and eurasia, based on the females devotion and protection of her cubs. in many native american cultures, the bear is a symbol of rebirth because of its hibernation and re-emergence. a widespread belief among cultures of north america and northern asia associated bears with shaman; this may be based on the solitary nature of both. bears have thus been thought to predict the future and shaman were believed to have been capable of transforming into bears.there is evidence of prehistoric bear worship, though this is disputed by archaeologists. it is possible that bear worship existed in early chinese and ainu cultures. the prehistoric finns, siberian peoples and more recently koreans considered the bear as the spirit of their forefathers. artio  in ancient greece, the archaic cult of artemis in bear form survived into classical times at brauron, where young athenian girls passed an initiation right as arktai ""she bears"".the constellations of ursa major and ursa minor, the great and little bears, are named for their supposed resemblance to bears, from the time of ptolemy. the nearby star arcturus means ""guardian of the bear"", as if it were watching the two constellations. ursa major has been associated with a bear for as much as 13,000 years since paleolithic times, in the widespread cosmic hunt myths. these are found on both sides of the bering land bridge, which was lost to the sea some 11,000 years ago.bears are popular in childrens stories, including winnie the pooh, paddington bear, gentle ben and ""the brown bear of norway"". an early version of ""goldilocks and the three bears"", was published as ""the three bears"" in 1837 by robert southey, many times retold, and illustrated in 1918 by arthur rackham. the hanna-barbera character yogi bear has appeared in numerous comic books, animated television shows and films. the care bears began as greeting cards in 1982, and were featured as toys, on clothing and in film. around the world, many children he had refused to shoot an american black bear tied to a tree.bears, like other animals, may symbolize nations. the russian bear has been a common national personification for russia from the 16th century onward. smokey bear has become a part of american culture since his introduction in 1944, with his message ""only you can prevent forest fires"".the international association for bear research & management, also known as the international bear association, and the bear specialist group of the species survival commission, a part of the international union for conservation of nature focus on the natural history, management, and conservation of bears. bear trust international works for wild bears and other wildlife through four core program initiatives, namely conservation education, wild bear research, wild bear management, and habitat conservation.specialty organizations for each of the eight species of bears worldwide include:",1,0
"a postcard or post card is a piece of thick paper or thin cardboard, typically rectangular, intended for writing and mailing without an envelope. non-rectangular shapes may also be used but are rare. there are novelty exceptions, such as wooden postcards, copper postcards sold in the copper country of the u.s. state of michigan, and coconut ""postcards"" from tropical islands.in some places, one can send a postcard for a lower fee than a letter. stamp collectors distinguish between postcards production of postcards blossomed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. as an easy and quick way for individuals to communicate, they became extremely popular. the study and collecting of postcards is termed deltiology cards with messages have been sporadically created and posted by individuals since the beginning of postal services. the earliest known picture postcard was a hand-painted design on card created by the writer theodore hook. hook posted the card, which bears a penny black stamp, to himself in 1840 from fulham  he probably did so as a practical joke on the postal service, since the image is a caricature of workers in the post office. in 2002 the postcard sold for a record , and were followed thereafter by france, japan, romania, serbia, spain, and the united states between 1873 and 1874. many of these postals included small images on the same side as the postage. postcards began to be sent internationally after the first congress of the general postal union, which met in bern, switzerland in october 1874. the treaty of bern was ratified in the united states in 1875.the first known printed picture postcard, with an image on one side, was created in france in 1870 at camp conlie by l in great britain and the first german card appeared in 1874. private advertising cards started appearing in the united states around 1873, and qualified for a special postage rate of one cent. private cards inspired lipmans card were also produced concurrently with the u.s. government postal in 1873. the backs of these private cards contained the words ""correspondence card"", ""mail card"" or ""souvenir card"" and required two-cent postage if they were written upon.cards showing images increased in number during the 1880s. images of the newly built eiffel tower in 1889 and 1890 gave impetus to the postcard, leading to the so-called ""golden age"" of the picture postcard. this golden age began slightly earlier in europe than the united states, likely due to a depression in the 1890s. still, the chicago worlds fair in 1893 excited many attendees with its line of ""official souvenir"" postals, which popularized the idea of picture postcards. the stage was now set for private postcard industry to boom, which it did once the united states government changed the postage rate for private cards from two cents to one in may 1898.spanning from approximately 1905 to 1915 in the united states, the golden age of postcards stemmed from a combination of social, economic, and governmental factors. demand for postcards increased, government restrictions on production loosened, and technological advances  in addition, the expansion of rural free delivery allowed mail to be delivered to more american households than ever before. billions of postcards were mailed during the golden age, including nearly a billion per year in united states from 1905 to 1915, and 7 billion worldwide in 1905. many postcards from this era were in fact never posted but directly acquired by collectors themselves.despite years of incredible success, economic and government forces would ultimately spell the end of the golden age. the peak came sometime between 1907 and 1910 for the united states. in 1909, american publishers successfully lobbied to place tariffs on high quality german imports with the payne-aldrich tariff act. the effects of tariffs really started to make a large impact, and escalating hostilities in europe made it difficult to import cards and ink into the united states. the fad may have also simply run its natural course. the war disrupted production efforts in europe, although postcard production did not entirely stop. cards were still useful for propaganda, and for boosting troop morale.after the war, the production of postcards continued, albeit in different styles than before. demand for postcards decreased, especially as telephone usage grew. there was still a need for postcards, which would be dubbed the ""poor mans telephone"". as tastes changed, publishers began focusing on scenic views, humor, and fashion. ""white border"" cards, which existed prior to the war, were produced in greater numbers from roughly 1915 to 1930 in the united states. they required less ink and had lower production standards than fine german cards. these were later replaced by ""linen"" postcards in the 1930s and 1940s, which used a printing process popularized by curt teich. finally, the modern era of photochrom  these glossy, colorful postcards are what we most commonly encounter today.in july 1879, the post office of india introduced a quarter anna postcard that could be posted from one place to another within british india. this was the cheapest form of post provided to the indian people to date and proved a huge success. the establishment of a large postal system spanning india resulted in unprecedented postal access: a message on a postcard could be sent from one part of the country to another part :4234 the postcard facility continues to this date in independent india.official postcards were introduced in december 1873, shortly after stamps were introduced to japan. return postcards were introduced in 1885, sealed postcards in 1900, and private postcards were allowed from 1900.in japan, official postcards have one side dedicated exclusively to the address, and the other side for the content, though commemorative picture postcards and private picture postcards also exist. in japan today, two particular idiosyncratic postcard customs exist: new years day postcards  gives the following definition:post card is a standard rectangular form of a paper for public postings. according to the same state standards, cards are classified according to the type and kind.depending on whether or not the image on the card printing postage stamp cards are divided into two types:depending on whether or not the card illustrations, cards are divided into two types:cards, depending on the location of illustrations divided into:depending on the walking area cards subdivided into:in britain, postcards without images were issued by the post office in 1870, and were printed with a stamp as part of the design, which was included in the price of purchase. these cards came in two sizes. the larger size was found to be slightly too large for ease of handling, and was soon withdrawn in favour of cards 13mm  75 million of these cards were sent within britain during 1870.in 1973 the british post office introduced a new type of card, phq cards, popular with collectors, especially when they have the appropriate stamp affixed and a first day of issue postmark obtained.in 1894, british publishers were given permission by the royal mail to manufacture and distribute picture postcards, which could be sent through the post. it was originally  thought that the first uk postcards were produced by printing firm stewarts of edinburgh but later research, published in picture postcard monthly in 1991, has shown that the first gb picture card was published by etw dennis of scarborough. two postmarked examples of the september 1894 etw dennis card have survived but no cards of stewarts dated 1894 have been found. early postcards were pictures of landmarks, scenic views, photographs or drawings of celebrities and so on. with steam locomotives providing fast and affordable travel, the seaside became a popular tourist destination, and generated its own souvenir-industry.in the early 1930s, cartoon-style saucy postcards became widespread, and at the peak of their popularity the sale of saucy postcards reached a massive 16 million a year. they were often bawdy in nature, making use of innuendo and double entendres, and traditionally featured stereotypical characters such as vicars, large ladies, and put-upon husbands, in the same vein as the carry on films.in the early 1950s, the newly elected conservative government were concerned at the apparent deterioration of morals in britain and decided on a crackdown on these postcards. the main target of their campaign was the postcard artist donald mcgill. in the more liberal 1960s, the saucy postcard was revived and later came to be considered, by some, as an art form.original postcards are now highly sought after, and rare examples can command high prices at auction. the best-known saucy seaside postcards were created by a publishing company called bamforths, based in the town of holmfirth, west yorkshire, england.despite the decline in popularity of postcards that are overtly saucy, postcards continue to be a significant economic and cultural aspect of british seaside tourism. sold by newsagents and street vendors, as well as by specialist souvenir shops, modern seaside postcards often feature multiple depictions of the resort in unusually favourable weather conditions. british photographer john hinde used saturated colour and meticulously planned his photographs, which made his postcards of the later twentieth century become collected and admired as kitsch. such cards are also respected as important documents of social history, and have been influential on the work of martin parr.there are several common motifs present in american postcard design, most shaped by production practices and laws in place at the time of production. these have been identified by deltiologists and grouped together into what are commonly referred to as eras or periods which describe a postcards style or method of production. while features of these eras, such as a divided back, are present in other countries as well, the dates of production may differ. for example, ""divided back"" postcards were introduced to great britain in 1902, 5 years before the united states. the golden age of postcards is commonly defined in the united states as starting around 1905, peaking between 1907 and 1910, and ending by world war i. listed here are eras of production for specific types of postcards, as typically defined by deltiologists. most of the dates are not fixed dates, but approximate points in time as there was a lot of overlap in production. these will be further elaborated upon in the following sections.others styles of postcards have fairly established dates of production as well. these are not typically referred to as eras, as they were never the predominate type at any given time.under an act passed by the u.s. congress on february 27, 1861, privately printed cards  john p. charlton copyrighted the first postcard in america that same year. the rights to this card were later sold to hymen l. lipman, who began reissuing the cards under his name in 1870. the u.s. postmaster general john creswell recommended to the u.s. congress one-cent postal cards in november 1870. legislation was passed on june 8, 1872, which allowed the government to produce postal cards.by law, only government-issued postcards were allowed to say ""postal card"". privately printed postcards were still allowed but they were more expensive to mail  backs of these private cards typically contained the words ""correspondence card"", ""mail card"" or ""souvenir card"". the morgan envelope factory of springfield, massachusetts claims to have produced the first american postcard in 1873.political hold-ups including concerns by future president james garfield  finally, it was issued in may 1873, and first went on sale in springfield, massachusetts on may 12th of that year. according to the new york times, postal clerks in the city sold 200,000 cards within 2.5 hours on may 14th. nationwide, 31 million postal cards were sold by the end of june 1873, and more than 64 million by the end of september. the numbers only continued to grow through 1910.there were many worlds fairs and expositions held across the united states in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. the first to be depicted in an early advertising postcard was the interstate industrial exposition that took place in chicago in 1873. as that exposition card was not intended to be a souvenir, the first postcard to be printed explicitly as a souvenir in the united states was created for the 1893 worlds columbian exposition, also in chicago. there were 120 different images of the exposition printed on government postals by private distributors. among the most popular, was charles w. goldsmiths set of ten postcard designs  governmental postal cards, and private souvenir cards featuring buildings and exposition grounds remained popular staples of future expositions.one large mix-up occurred at the 1895 cotton states and international exposition in atlanta. all of the postcards there were printed on plain card stock, so most people assumed they were government-issued postals requiring one cent for postage instead of two. the incident made the headlines.the u.s. congress passed an act on may 19, 1898 which allowed private printers and publishers to officially produce postcards, and for them to be posted at the same rate as government-produced postals  until this time, privately printed cards bore the terms ""correspondence card"", ""mail card"" or ""souvenir card"". the act now required private cards to state ""private mailing card, authorized by act of congress of may 19, 1898"". hence, deltiologists have referred to this as the ""private mailing card act"". this prohibition on verbiage was rescinded on december 24, 1901, by the postmaster-general, who issued post office order no. 1447. it allowed private postcards to use the term ""post card"" on their backs. the order also shortened the requirement and allowed private publishers to omit the citation to the 1898 act. still, correspondents could only write on the front of the postcard, the back was reserved for the recipients address. this has become known as the ""undivided back"" era of postcards.the universal postal congress decreed that government-issued postcards in the united states could contain messages on the address side beginning march 1, 1907. in line with these changes, the united states congress passed an act on march 1, 1907, which extended this to privately-produced cards. these laws were further tweaked by orders of the u.s. postmaster-general that same year. this ushered in the ""divided back"" era of postcards, which lasted until world war i. on these cards the back is divided into two sections: the left section is used for the message and the right for the address.thus began the ""golden age"" of american postcards, which roughly spanned from 1905 to the first world war. others define the ""golden age"" as aligning more closely with the ""divided back"" era. regardless, it peaked between 1907 and 1910, and started to decline with the introduction of tariffs on german-printed postcards in 1909. the postcard craze between 1907 and 1910 was particularly popular among rural and small-town women in northern u.s. states. many social, economic, and governmental factors combined to create the postcard boom. demand for postcards increased, government restrictions on production loosened, and technological advances  in addition, the expansion of rural free delivery allowed mail to be delivered to more american households than ever before. other factors included shifts in artistic taste among the public, and the development of a sale and distribution network of jobbers and importers--connecting main street america with german printers. billions of postcards were posted during the golden age, with nearly 700 million postcards mailed during the year ending june 30, 1908 alone.the decline began with the payne-aldrich tariff act of 1909, which was mostly lobbied for by american publishers who did not wish to compete with german publishers. by some estimates, the new tariffs on postcards were an increase of 300 percent. many distributors imported large quantities of german-produced cards before the tariffs took effect, causing a glut in the market. german publishers began moving production to the united states shortly after the payne-aldrich tariff act to keep selling to the american market. ultimately, the tariffs contributed to the end of the ""golden age"" as publishing quality decreased  the national postcard association was formed to combat unfair practices, low prices, and an excessive amount of unsalable postcards. effects of the tariffs were reinforced by the british naval blockade of german merchant ships at the outbreak of world war i in 1914. postcard manufacturers called off their annual conventions that year, and many shifted to greeting card production. the war cut off the importation of fine german-produced cards as well as dyes used for ink--which were largely produced by the german empire. production of some postcards would continue during the war, to support propaganda efforts and troop morale.in response to the war-time shortages of ink, and the restrictions placed on importation, american publishers began producing larger quantities of postcards which featured a white border on the edges. although these were seen occasionally prior to the war, this design change allowed publishers to save ink and lowered the precision threshold for cutting the cards. the ""white border"" era would last from about 1913 to 1930. during this period, public tastes had changed and publishers began focusing more on scenic views, humor, fashion, and surrealism.mid-century ""linen"" postcards were produced in great quantity from 1930 to 1945, although they continued to be produced more than a decade after the introduction of photochrom cards. despite the name, ""linen"" postcards were not produced on a linen fabric, but used newer printing processes that used an inexpensive card stock with a high rag content, and were then finished with a pattern which resembled linen. the face of the cards is distinguished by a textured cloth appearance which makes them easily recognizable. the reverse of the card is smooth, like earlier postcards. the rag content in the card stock allowed a much more colorful and vibrant image to be printed than the earlier ""white border"" style. due to the inexpensive production and bright realistic images they became popular.one of the better known ""linen-era"" postcard manufacturers was curt teich and company, who first produced the immensely popular ""large letter linen"" postcards by the late 1920s new colorants had been developed that were very enticing to the printing industry. though they were best used as dyes to show off their brightness, this proved to be problematic. where traditional pigment based inks would lie on a papers surface, these thinner watery dyes had a tendency to be absorbed into a papers fibers, where it lost its advantage of higher color density, leaving behind a dull blurry finish. to experience the rich colors of dyes light must be able to pass through them to excite their electrons. a partial solution was to combine these dyes with petroleum distillates, leading to faster drying heatset inks. but it was curt teich who finally solved the problem by embossing paper with a linen texture before printing. the embossing created more surface area, which allowed the new heatset inks to dry even faster. the quicker drying time allowed these dyes to remain on the papers surface, thus retaining their superior strength, which give linens their telltale bright colors. in addition to printing with the usual cymk colors, a lighter blue was sometimes used to give the images extra punch. higher speed presses could also accommodate this method, leading to its widespread use. although first introduced in 1931, their growing popularity was interrupted by the outbreak of war. they were not to be printed in numbers again until the later 1940s, when the war effort ceased consuming most of the country inches  however, some postcards have deviated from this  early postcards often showcased photography of nude women. illegal to produce in the united states, these were commonly known as french postcards, due to the large number of them produced in france. other countries objected to the inappropriate use of religious imagery. the ottoman empire banned the sale or importation of some materials relating to the islamic prophet muhammad in 1900. affected postcards that were successfully sent through the ottoman empire before this date  in 1908, 3,000 letters and destroyed only 156  censors in all warring countries also filtered out propaganda that disparaged the enemy or approved of atrocities. for example, german censors prevented postcards with hostile slogans such as ""jeder sto3. the intersection shown is at 8th & broad streets.hawaiian aloha nui postcard c. 1908german postcard with inscription ""this beer belongs to my master!""julian mandel: marionnette \xc3\xa0

"richard milhous nixon  however, evaluations of him have proven complex, with successes as president contrasted against the circumstances of his departure from office.richard milhous nixon was born on january 9, 1913, in yorba linda, california, in a house built by his father. his parents were hannah nixons upbringing was marked by evangelical quaker observances of the time such as refraining from alcohol, dancing, and swearing. nixon had four brothers: harold  four of the five nixon boys were named after kings who had ruled in medieval or legendary britain; richard, for example, was named after richard the lionheart.nixons early life was marked by hardship, and he later quoted a saying of eisenhower to describe his boyhood: ""we were poor, but the glory of it was we didnt know it"". the nixon family ranch failed in 1922, and the family moved to whittier, california. in an area with many quakers, frank nixon opened a grocery store and gas station. richards younger brother arthur died in 1925 at the age of seven after a short illness. richard was twelve years old when a spot was found on his lung. with a family history of tuberculosis, he was forbidden to play sports. eventually, the spot was found to be scar tissue from an early bout of pneumonia.richard attended east whittier elementary school, where he was president of his eighth-grade class. his parents believed that attending whittier high school had caused richards older brother harold to live a dissolute lifestyle before he fell ill of tuberculosis  he had to ride a school bus for an hour each way during his freshman year and received excellent grades. later, he lived with an aunt in fullerton during the week. he played junior varsity football, and seldom missed a practice, though he was rarely used in games. he had greater success as a debater, winning a number of championships and taking his only formal tutelage in public speaking from fullertons head of english, h. lynn sheller. nixon later remembered shellers words, ""remember, speaking is conversation...dont shout at people. talk to them. converse with them."" nixon said he tried to use a conversational tone as much as possible.at the start of his junior year in september 1928, richards parents permitted him to transfer to whittier high school. at whittier, nixon suffered his first election defeat when he lost his bid for student body president. he often rose at 407.nixon was offered a tuition grant to attend harvard university, but harolds continued illness and the need for their mother to care for him meant richard was needed at the store. he remained in his hometown and attended whittier college with his expenses covered by a bequest from his maternal grandfather. nixon played for the basketball team; he also tried out for football but lacked the size to play. he remained on the team as a substitute and was noted for his enthusiasm. instead of fraternities and sororities, whittier had literary societies. nixon was snubbed by the only one for men, the franklins; many of the franklins were from prominent families, but nixon was not. he responded by helping to found a new society, the orthogonian society. in addition to the society, schoolwork, and work at the store, nixon found time for a large number of extracurricular activities, becoming a champion debater and gaining a reputation as a hard worker. in 1933, he became engaged to ola florence welch, daughter of the whittier police chief. they broke up in 1935.after graduating summa cum laude with a bachelor of arts degree in history from whittier in 1934, nixon received a full scholarship to attend duke university school of law. the school was new and sought to attract top students by offering scholarships. it paid high salaries to its professors, many of whom had national or international reputations. the number of scholarships was greatly reduced for second- and third-year students, forcing recipients into intense competition. nixon not only kept his scholarship but was elected president of the duke bar association, inducted into the order of the coif, and graduated third in his class in june 1937.after graduating from duke, nixon initially hoped to join the fbi. he received no response to his letter of application and learned years later that he had been hired, but his appointment had been canceled at the last minute due to budget cuts. instead, he returned to california and was admitted to the california bar in 1937. he began practicing in whittier with the law firm wingert and bewley, working on commercial litigation for local petroleum companies and other corporate matters, as well as on wills. in later years, nixon proudly said he was the only modern president to have previously worked as a practicing attorney. nixon was reluctant to work on divorce cases, disliking frank sexual talk from women. in 1938, he opened up his own branch of wingert and bewley in la habra, california, and became a full partner in the firm the following year.in january 1938 nixon was cast in the whittier community players production of the dark tower. there he played opposite a high school teacher named thelma ""pat"" ryan. nixon described it in his memoirs as ""a case of love at first sight""1, 1940. after a honeymoon in mexico, the nixons began their married life in whittier. they had two daughters, tricia in january 1942 the couple moved to washington, d.c., where nixon took a job at the office of price administration. in his political campaigns, nixon would suggest that this was his response to pearl harbor, but he had sought the position throughout the latter part of 1941. both nixon and his wife believed he was limiting his prospects by remaining in whittier. he was assigned to the tire rationing division, where he was tasked with replying to correspondence. he did not enjoy the role, and four months later applied to join the united states navy. as a birthright quaker, he could have by law claimed exemption from the draft; he might also have been deferred because he worked in government service. in spite of that, nixon sought a commission in the navy. his application was successful, and he was appointed a lieutenant junior grade in the u.s naval reserve in october 1942, he was assigned as aide to the commander of the naval air station ottumwa in iowa until may 1943. seeking more excitement, he requested sea duty and on july 2, 1943, was assigned to marine aircraft group 25 and the south pacific combat air transport command  on october 1, 1943, nixon was promoted to lieutenant. nixon commanded the scat forward detachments at vella lavella, bougainville, and finally at green island  his unit prepared manifests and flight plans for r4d/c-47 operations and supervised the loading and unloading of the transport aircraft. for this service, he received a navy letter of commendation  for ""meritorious service, tireless effort, and devotion to duty"". later, nixon was transferred to other offices to work on contracts and finally to baltimore. on october 3, 1945, he was promoted to lieutenant commander. on march 10, 1946, he was relieved of active duty. on june 1, 1953, he was promoted to commander in the u.s. naval reserve, from which he retired in the u.s. naval reserve on june 6, 1966.republicans in californias 12th congressional district were frustrated by their inability to defeat democratic representative jerry voorhis. they sought a consensus candidate who would run a strong campaign against him. in 1945, they formed a ""committee of 100"" to decide on a candidate, hoping to avoid internal dissensions which had led to previous voorhis victories. after the committee failed to attract higher-profile candidates, herman perry, manager of whittiers bank of america branch, suggested nixon, a family friend with whom he had served on the whittier college board of trustees before the war. perry wrote to nixon in baltimore. after a night of excited talk between nixon and his wife, he responded to perry with enthusiasm. nixon flew to california and was selected by the committee. when he left the navy at the start of 1946, nixon and his wife returned to whittier, where nixon began a year of intensive campaigning. he contended that voorhis had been ineffective as a representative and suggested that voorhiss endorsement by a group linked to communists meant that voorhis must have radical views. nixon won the election, receiving 65,586 votes to voorhiss 49,994.in june 1947, nixon supported the taft. he had no strong preference for a vice-presidential candidate, and republican officeholders and party officials met in a ""smoke-filled room"" and recommended nixon to the general, who agreed to the senators selection. nixons youth  on the campaign trail, eisenhower spoke to his plans for the country, leaving the negative campaigning to his running mate.in mid-september, the republican ticket faced a major crisis. the media reported that nixon had a political fund, maintained by his backers, which reimbursed him for political expenses. such a fund was not illegal but it exposed nixon to allegations of a possible conflict of interest. with pressure building for eisenhower to demand nixons resignation from the ticket the senator went on television to deliver an address to the nation on september 23, 1952. the address, later termed the checkers speech, was heard by about 604, 1955, president eisenhower suffered a heart attack; his condition was initially believed to be life-threatening. eisenhower was unable to perform his duties for six weeks. the 25th amendment to the united states constitution had not yet been proposed, and the vice president had no formal power to act. nonetheless, nixon acted in eisenhowers stead during this period, presiding over cabinet meetings and ensuring that aides and cabinet officers did not seek power. according to nixon biographer stephen ambrose, nixon had ""earned the high praise he received for his conduct during the crisis7, 1958, richard and pat nixon reluctantly embarked on a goodwill tour of south america. in montevideo, uruguay, nixon made an impromptu visit to a college campus, where he fielded questions from students on u.s. foreign policy. the trip was uneventful until the nixon party reached lima, peru, where he was met with student demonstrations. nixon went to the historical campus of national university of san marcos, the oldest university in the americas, got out of his car to confront the students, and stayed until forced back into the car by a volley of thrown objects. at his hotel, nixon faced another mob, and one demonstrator spat on him. in caracas, venezuela, nixon and his wife were spat on by anti-american demonstrators and their limousine was attacked by a pipe-wielding mob. according to ambrose, nixons courageous conduct ""caused even some of his bitterest enemies to give him some grudging respect"". reporting to the cabinet after the trip, nixon claimed there was ""absolute proof that  were directed and controlled by a central communist conspiracy."" secretary of state john foster dulles concurred in this view; director of central intelligence allen dulles sharply rebuked it.in july 1959 president eisenhower sent nixon to the soviet union for the opening of the american national exhibition in moscow. on july 24, nixon was touring the exhibits with soviet first secretary and premier nikita khrushchev when the two stopped at a model of an american kitchen and engaged in an impromptu exchange about the merits of capitalism versus communism that became known as the ""kitchen debate"".in 1960 nixon launched his first campaign for president of the united states. he faced little opposition in the republican primaries and chose former massachusetts senator henry cabot lodge jr. as his running mate. his democratic opponent was john f. kennedy and the race remained close for the duration. nixon campaigned on his experience but kennedy called for new blood and claimed the eisenhower,827 votes there were charges of voter fraud in texas and illinois, both states won by kennedy. nixon refused to consider contesting the election, feeling a lengthy controversy would diminish the united states in the eyes of the world and the uncertainty would hurt u.s. interests. at the end of his term of office as vice president in january 1961, nixon and his family returned to california, where he practiced law and wrote a bestselling book, six crises, which included coverage of the hiss case, eisenhowers heart attack, and the fund crisis, which had been resolved by the checkers speech.local and national republican leaders encouraged nixon to challenge incumbent pat brown for governor of california in the 1962 election. despite initial reluctance, nixon entered the race. the campaign was clouded by public suspicion that nixon viewed the office as a stepping stone for another presidential run, some opposition from the far-right of the party, and his own lack of interest in being californias governor. nixon hoped a successful run would confirm his status as the nations leading active republican politician, and ensure he remained a major player in national politics. instead, he lost to brown by more than five percentage points, and the defeat was widely believed to be the end of his political career. in an impromptu concession speech the morning after the election, nixon blamed the media for favoring his opponent, saying, ""you wont have nixon to kick around anymore because, gentlemen, this is my last press conference."" the california defeat was highlighted in the november 11, 1962, episode of abcs howard k. smith: news and comment, titled ""the political obituary of richard m. nixon"". alger hiss appeared on the program, and many members of the public complained that it was unseemly to give a convicted felon air time to attack a former vice president. the furor drove smith and his program from the air, and public sympathy for nixon grew.in 1963 the nixon family traveled to europe, where nixon gave press conferences and met with leaders of the countries he visited. the family moved to new york city, where nixon became a senior partner in the leading law firm nixon, mudge, rose, guthrie & alexander. when announcing his california campaign, nixon had pledged not to run for president in 1964; even if he had not, he believed it would be difficult to defeat kennedy, or after his assassination, kennedys successor, lyndon johnson.in 1964, he supported arizona senator barry goldwater for the republican nomination for u.s. president; when goldwater won the nomination, nixon was selected to introduce him at the convention. although he thought goldwater unlikely to win, nixon campaigned for him loyally. the election was a disaster for the republicans; goldwaters landslide loss to johnson was matched by heavy losses for the party in congress and among state governors.nixon was one of the few leading republicans not blamed for the disastrous results, and he sought to build on that in the 1966 congressional elections. he campaigned for many republicans, seeking to regain seats lost in the johnson landslide, and received credit for helping the republicans make major gains that year.at the end of 1967, nixon told his family he planned to run for president a second time. although pat nixon did not always enjoy public life  she was supportive of her husbands ambitions. nixon believed that with the democrats torn over the issue of the vietnam war, a republican had a good chance of winning, although he expected the election to be as close as in 1960.one of the most tumultuous primary election seasons ever began as the tet offensive was launched in january 1968. president johnson withdrew as a candidate in march, after doing unexpectedly poorly in the new hampshire primary. in june, senator robert f. kennedy, a democratic candidate, was assassinated just moments after his victory in the california primary. on the republican side, nixons main opposition was michigan governor george romney, though new york governor nelson rockefeller and california governor ronald reagan each hoped to be nominated in a brokered convention. nixon secured the nomination on the first ballot. he selected maryland governor spiro agnew as his running mate, a choice which nixon believed would unite the party, appealing both to northern moderates and to southerners disaffected with the democrats.nixons democratic opponent in the general election was vice president hubert humphrey, who was nominated at a convention marked by violent protests. throughout the campaign, nixon portrayed himself as a figure of stability during a period of national unrest and upheaval. he appealed to what he later called the ""silent majority"" of socially conservative americans who disliked the hippie counterculture and the anti-war demonstrators. agnew became an increasingly vocal critic of these groups, solidifying nixons position with the right.nixon waged a prominent television advertising campaign, meeting with supporters in front of cameras. he stressed that the crime rate was too high, and attacked what he perceived as a surrender by the democrats of the united states nuclear superiority. nixon promised ""peace with honor"" in the vietnam war and proclaimed that ""new leadership will end the war and win the peace in the pacific"". he did not release specifics of how he hoped to end the war, resulting in media intimations that he must have a ""secret plan"". his slogan of ""nixons the one"" proved to be effective.johnsons negotiators hoped to reach a truce, or at least a cessation of bombings, in vietnam prior to the election. on october 22, 1968, candidate nixon received information that johnson was preparing a so-called ""october surprise"" to elect humphrey in the last days of the campaign, and his administration had abandoned three non-negotiable conditions for a bombing halt. whether the nixon campaign interfered with any ongoing negotiations between the johnson administration and the south vietnamese by engaging anna chennault, a prominent chinese-american fundraiser for the republican party, remains an ongoing controversy. while notes uncovered in 2016 may support such a contention, the context of said notes remains of debate. it is not clear whether the government of south vietnam needed much encouragement to opt out of a peace process they considered disadvantageous.in a three-way race between nixon, humphrey, and american independent party candidate former alabama governor george wallace, nixon defeated humphrey by nearly 500,000 votes  he became the first former vice president to have returned to private life and subsequently be elected president. in his victory speech, nixon pledged that his administration would try to bring the divided nation together. nixon said: ""i have received a very gracious message from the vice president, congratulating me for winning the election. i congratulated him for his gallant and courageous fight against great odds. i also told him that i know exactly how he felt. i know how it feels to lose a close one.""nixon was inaugurated as president on january 20, 1969, sworn in by his onetime political rival, chief justice earl warren. pat nixon held the family bibles open at isaiah 2:4, which reads, ""they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks."" in his inaugural address, which received almost uniformly positive reviews, nixon remarked that ""the greatest honor history can bestow is the title of peacemaker"", nixon and his wife traveled to china. kissinger briefed nixon for over 40 carpet bombing campaign of north vietnamese  in mid-1969, nixon began efforts to negotiate peace with the north vietnamese, sending a personal letter to north vietnamese leaders, and peace talks began in paris. initial talks, however, did not result in an agreement. in may 1969 he publicly proposed to withdraw all american troops from south vietnam provided north vietnam also did so and for south vietnam to hold internationally supervised elections with viet cong participation.in july 1969, nixon visited south vietnam, where he met with his u.s. military commanders and president nguy cuban missile crisis. on taking office in 1969, he stepped up covert operations against cuba and its president, fidel castro. he maintained close relations with the cuban-american exile community through his friend, bebe rebozo, who often suggested ways of irritating castro. these activities concerned the soviets and cubans, who feared nixon might attack cuba and break the understanding between kennedy and khrushchev which had ended the missile crisis. in august 1970, the soviets asked nixon to reaffirm the understanding; despite his hard line against castro, nixon agreed. the process had not yet been completed when the soviets began expanding their base at the cuban port of cienfuegos in october 1970. a minor confrontation ensued, which was concluded with an understanding that the soviets would not use cienfuegos for submarines bearing ballistic missiles. the final round of diplomatic notes, reaffirming the 1962 accord, were exchanged in november.the election of marxist candidate salvador allende as president of chile in september 1970 spurred nixon and kissinger to pursue a vigorous campaign of covert opposition to allende,:25 first designed to convince the chilean congress to confirm jorge alessandri as the winner of the election and then messages to military officers in support of a coup. other support included strikes organized against allende and funding for allende opponents. it was even alleged that ""nixon personally authorized"" $700,000 in covert funds to print anti-allende messages in a prominent chilean newspaper.:93 following an extended period of social, political, and economic unrest, general augusto pinochet assumed power in a violent coup d2, 1972, and met with leonid brezhnev, the general secretary of the communist party; alexei kosygin, the chairman of the council of ministers; and nikolai podgorny, the chairman of the presidium of the supreme soviet, among other leading soviet officials.nixon engaged in intense negotiations with brezhnev. out of the summit came agreements for increased trade and two landmark arms control treaties: salt i, the first comprehensive limitation pact signed by the two superpowers, and the anti-ballistic missile treaty, which banned the development of systems designed to intercept incoming missiles. nixon and brezhnev proclaimed a new era of ""peaceful coexistence"". a banquet was held that evening at the kremlin.nixon and kissinger planned to link arms control to d7 to a welcome ceremony, cheering crowds, and a state dinner at the grand kremlin palace that evening. nixon and brezhnev met in yalta, where they discussed a proposed mutual defense pact, d0:i believe that, beyond a doubt, we are now facing the best opportunity we have had in 15 years to build a lasting peace in the middle east. i am convinced history will hold us responsible if we let this opportunity slip by011 study of nixons economic record, the new president did little to alter johnsons policies through the first year of his presidency.nixon was far more interested in foreign affairs than domestic policies, but he believed that voters tend to focus on their own financial condition, and that economic conditions were a threat to his reelection. as part of his ""new federalism"" views, he proposed grants to the states, but these proposals were for the most part lost in the congressional budget process. however, nixon gained political credit for advocating them. in 1970, congress had granted the president the power to impose wage and price freezes, though the democratic majorities, knowing nixon had opposed such controls through his career, did not expect nixon to actually use the authority. with inflation unresolved by august 1971, and an election year looming, nixon convened a summit of his economic advisers at camp david. he then announced temporary wage and price controls, allowed the dollar to float against other currencies, and ended the convertibility of the dollar into gold. bowles points out,by identifying himself with a policy whose purpose was inflations defeat, nixon made it difficult for democratic opponents, although their aftereffects contributed to inflation during his second term and into the ford administration.after nixon won re-election, inflation was returning. he reimposed price controls in june 1973. the price controls became unpopular with the public and businesspeople, who saw powerful labor unions as preferable to the price board bureaucracy. the controls produced food shortages, as meat disappeared from grocery stores and farmers drowned chickens rather than sell them at a loss. despite the failure to control inflation, controls were slowly ended, and on april 30, 1974, their statutory authorization lapsed.nixon advocated a ""new federalism"", which would devolve power to state and local elected officials, though congress was hostile to these ideas and enacted few of them. he eliminated the cabinet-level united states post office department, which in 1971 became the government-run united states postal service.nixon was a late supporter of the conservation movement. environmental policy had not been a significant issue in the 1968 election, and the candidates were rarely asked for their views on the subject. nixon broke new ground by discussing environmental policy in his state of the union speech in 1970. he saw that the first earth day in april 1970 presaged a wave of voter interest on the subject, and sought to use that to his benefit; in june he announced the formation of the environmental protection agency  he relied on his domestic advisor john ehrlichman, who favored protection of natural resources, to keep him ""out of trouble on environmental issues."" other initiatives supported by nixon included the clean air act of 1970 and the occupational safety and health administration  nixon vetoed the clean water act of 1972. while nixon called for increased spending on such high-profile items as sickle-cell disease and for a war on cancer, at the same time he sought to reduce overall spending at the national institutes of health.the nixon presidency witnessed the first large-scale integration of public schools in the south. nixon sought a middle way between the segregationist wallace and liberal democrats, whose support of integration was alienating some southern whites. hopeful of doing well in the south in 1972, he sought to dispose of desegregation as a political issue before then. soon after his inauguration, he appointed vice president agnew to lead a task force, which worked with local leaders.in addition to desegregating public schools, nixon implemented the philadelphia plan in 1970 and went to the states for ratification. he also pushed for african american civil rights and economic equity through a concept known as black capitalism. nixon had campaigned as an era supporter in 1968, though feminists criticized him for doing little to help the era or their cause after his election. nevertheless, he appointed more women to administration positions than lyndon johnson had.after a nearly decade-long national effort, the united states won the race to land astronauts on the moon on july 20, 1969, with the flight of apollo 11. nixon spoke with neil armstrong and buzz aldrin during their moonwalk. he called the conversation ""the most historic phone call ever made from the white house"".nixon was unwilling to keep funding for the national aeronautics and space administration  nixon also canceled the air force manned orbital laboratory program in 1969, because unmanned spy satellites were a more cost-effective way to achieve the same reconnaissance objective. nasa cancelled the last three planned apollo lunar missions to place skylab in orbit more efficiently and free money up for the design and construction of the space shuttle.on may 24, 1972, nixon approved a five-year cooperative program between nasa and the soviet space program, culminating in the 1975 joint mission of an american apollo and soviet soyuz spacecraft linking in space.nixon believed his rise to power had peaked at a moment of political realignment. the democratic ""solid south"" had long been a source of frustration to republican ambitions. goldwater had won several southern states by opposing the civil rights act of 1964 but had alienated more moderate southerners. nixons efforts to gain southern support in 1968 were diluted by wallaces candidacy. through his first term, he pursued a southern strategy with policies, such as his desegregation plans, that would be broadly acceptable among southern whites, encouraging them to realign with the republicans in the aftermath of the civil rights movement. he nominated two southern conservatives, clement haynsworth and g. harrold carswell to the supreme court, but neither was confirmed by the senate.nixon entered his name on the new hampshire primary ballot on january 5, 1972, effectively announcing his candidacy for reelection. virtually assured the republican nomination, the president had initially expected his democratic opponent to be massachusetts senator edward m. kennedy  instead, maine senator edmund muskie became the front runner, with south dakota senator george mcgovern in a close second place.on june 10, mcgovern won the california primary and secured the democratic nomination. the following month, nixon was renominated at the 1972 republican national convention. he dismissed the democratic platform as cowardly and divisive. mcgovern intended to sharply reduce defense spending and supported amnesty for draft evaders as well as abortion rights. with some of his supporters believed to be in favor of drug legalization, mcgovern was perceived as standing for ""amnesty, abortion and acid"". mcgovern was also damaged by his vacillating support for his original running mate, missouri senator thomas eagleton, dumped from the ticket following revelations that he had received treatment for depression. nixon was ahead in most polls for the entire election cycle, and was reelected on november 7, 1972, in one of the largest landslide election victories in american history. he defeated mcgovern with over 60. the washington post picked up on the story; reporters carl bernstein and bob woodward relied on an informant known as ""deep throat""0, 1972, had an 00 pages of transcripts of white house conversations between himself and his aides. the house judiciary committee opened impeachment hearings against the president on may 9, 1974, which were televised on the major tv networks. these hearings culminated in votes for impeachment. on july 24, the supreme court ruled unanimously that the full tapes, not just selected transcripts, must be released.the scandal grew to involve a slew of additional allegations against the president, ranging from the improper use of government agencies to accepting gifts in office and his personal finances and taxes; nixon repeatedly stated his willingness to pay any outstanding taxes due, and later paid $465,000 even with support diminished by the continuing series of revelations, nixon hoped to fight the charges. but one of the new tapes, recorded soon after the break-in, demonstrated that nixon had been told of the white house connection to the watergate burglaries soon after they took place, and had approved plans to thwart the investigation. in a statement accompanying the release of what became known as the ""smoking gun tape"" on august 5, 1974, nixon accepted blame for misleading the country about when he had been told of white house involvement, stating that he had had a lapse of memory. senate minority leader hugh scott, senator barry goldwater, and house minority leader john jacob rhodes met with nixon soon after. rhodes told nixon he faced certain impeachment in the house. scott and goldwater told the president that he had, at most, only 15 votes in his favor in the senate, far fewer than the 34 needed to avoid removal from office.in light of his loss of political support and the near-certainty that he would be impeached and removed from office, nixon resigned the presidency on august 9, 1974, after addressing the nation on television the previous evening. the resignation speech was delivered from the oval office and was carried live on radio and television. nixon said he was resigning for the good of the country and asked the nation to support the new president, gerald ford. nixon went on to review the accomplishments of his presidency, especially in foreign policy. he defended his record as president, quoting from theodore roosevelts 1910 speech citizenship in a republic:sometimes i have succeeded and sometimes i have failed, but always i have taken heart from what theodore roosevelt once said about the man in the arena, ""whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs and comes up short again and again because there is not effort without error and shortcoming, but who does actually strive to do the deed, who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, who spends himself in a worthy cause, who at the best knows in the end the triumphs of high achievements and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly"".nixons speech received generally favorable initial responses from network commentators, with only roger mudd of cbs stating that nixon had not admitted wrongdoing. it was termed ""a masterpiece"" by conrad black, one of his biographers. black opined that ""what was intended to be an unprecedented humiliation for any american president, nixon converted into a virtual parliamentary acknowledgement of almost blameless insufficiency of legislative support to continue. he left while devoting half his address to a recitation of his accomplishments in office.""following his resignation, the nixons flew to their home la casa pacifica in san clemente, california. according to his biographer, jonathan aitken, ""nixon was a soul in torment"" after his resignation. congress had funded nixons transition costs, including some salary expenses, though reducing the appropriation from $850,000 to $200,000. with some of his staff still with him, nixon was at his desk by 7:00000 and well see how im regarded then.in 1978, nixon published his memoirs, rn: the memoirs of richard nixon, the first of ten books he was to author in his retirement. the book was a bestseller and attracted a generally positive critical response. nixon visited the white house in 1979, invited by carter for the state dinner for chinese vice premier deng xiaoping. carter had not wanted to invite nixon, but deng had said he would visit nixon in california if the former president was not invited. nixon had a private meeting with deng and visited beijing again in mid-1979.on august 10, 1979, the nixons purchased a 122, 1993, of emphysema and lung cancer. her funeral services were held on the grounds of the richard nixon library and birthplace. former president nixon was distraught throughout the interment and delivered a tribute to her inside the library building.nixon suffered a severe stroke on april 18, 1994, while preparing to eat dinner in his park ridge, new jersey home. a blood clot resulting from the atrial fibrillation he had suffered for many years had formed in his upper heart, broken off, and traveled to his brain. he was taken to new york hospital7, 1994, in yorba linda, california. eulogists at the nixon library ceremony included president bill clinton, former secretary of state henry kissinger, senate minority leader bob dole, california governor pete wilson, and the reverend billy graham. also in attendance were former presidents ford, carter, reagan, george h. w. bush, and their wives.richard nixon was buried beside his wife pat on the grounds of the nixon library. he was survived by his two daughters, tricia and julie, and four grandchildren. in keeping with his wishes, his funeral was not a full state funeral, though his body did lie in repose in the nixon library lobby from april 26 to the morning of the funeral service. mourners waited in line for up to eight hours in chilly, wet weather to pay their respects. at its peak, the line to pass by nixons casket was three miles long with an estimated 42,000 people waiting.john f. stacks of time magazine said of nixon shortly after his death,an outsize energy and determination drove him on to recover and rebuild after every self-created disaster that he faced. to reclaim a respected place in american public life after his resignation, he kept traveling and thinking and talking to the worlds leaders farewell speech, wrote,richard nixons jowly, beard-shadowed face, the ski-jump nose and the widows peak, the arms upstretched in the v-sign, had been so often pictured and caricatured, his presence had become such a familiar one in the land, he had been so often in the heat of controversy, that it was hard to realize the nation really would not ""have nixon to kick around anymore"".ambrose said of the reaction to nixons death, ""to everyones amazement, except his, hes our beloved elder statesman.""upon nixons death, almost all the news coverage mentioned watergate, but for the most part, the coverage was favorable to the former president. the dallas morning news stated, ""history ultimately should show that despite his flaws, he was one of our most farsighted chief executives."" this offended some; columnist russell baker complained of ""a group conspiracy to grant him absolution"". cartoonist jeff koterba of the omaha world-herald depicted history before a blank canvas, his subject nixon, as america looks on eagerly. the artist urges his audience to sit down; the work will take some time to complete, as ""this portrait is a little more complicated than most"".hunter s. thompson wrote a scathing piece denouncing nixon for rolling stone, entitled ""he was a crook""  in his article, thompson described nixon as ""a political monster straight out of grendel and a very dangerous enemy.""historian and political scientist james macgregor burns asked of nixon, ""how can one evaluate such an idiosyncratic president, so brilliant and so morally lacking?"" nixons biographers disagree on how he will be perceived by posterity. according to ambrose, ""nixon wanted to be judged by what he accomplished. what he will be remembered for is the nightmare he put the country through in his second term and for his resignation."" irwin gellman, who chronicled nixons congressional career, suggests, ""he was remarkable among his congressional peers, a success story in a troubled era, one who steered a sensible anti-communist course against the excess of mccarthy."" aitken feels that ""nixon, both as a man and as a statesman, has been excessively maligned for his faults and inadequately recognised for his virtues. yet even in a spirit of historical revisionism, no simple verdict is possible.""some historians say nixons southern strategy turned the southern united states into a republican stronghold, while others deem economic factors more important in the change. throughout his career, nixon moved his party away from the control of isolationists, and as a congressman he was a persuasive advocate of containing soviet communism. according to his biographer herbert parmet, ""nixons role was to steer the republican party along a middle course, somewhere between the competitive impulses of the rockefellers, the goldwaters, and the reagans.""nixons stance on domestic affairs has been credited with the passage and enforcement of environmental and regulatory legislation. in a 2011 paper on nixon and the environment, historian paul charles milazzo points to nixons creation of the united states environmental protection agency  nixon himself did not consider the environmental advances he made in office an important part of his legacy; some historians contend that his choices were driven more by political expediency than any strong environmentalism.nixon saw his policies on vietnam, china, and the soviet union as central to his place in history. nixons onetime opponent george mcgovern commented in 1983, ""president nixon probably had a more practical approach to the two superpowers, china and the soviet union, than any other president since world war\x80\x94whether they were breast-fed or bottle-fed. not me. no way.when nixon was told that most americans felt they did not know him even at the end of his career, he replied, ""yeah, its true. and its not necessary for them to know.""",1,0
"north vietnamese and viet cong/prg victory3,000 us advisors were stationed in south vietnam. in the gulf of tonkin incident in august, a u.s. destroyer was alleged to have clashed with north vietnamese fast attack craft. in response, the u.s. congress passed the gulf of tonkin resolution and gave president lyndon b. johnson broad authority to increase american military presence in vietnam. johnson ordered the deployment of combat units for the first time and increased troop levels to 184,000. past this point, the peoples army of vietnam :287 u.s. and south vietnam forces relied on air superiority and overwhelming firepower to conduct search and destroy operations, involving ground forces, artillery, and airstrikes. the u.s. also conducted a large-scale strategic bombing campaign against north vietnam and laos.the tet offensive of 1968 showed the lack of progress with these doctrines. with the vc and pavn mounting large-scale urban offensives throughout 1968, u.s domestic support for the war began fading. the army of the republic of vietnam :481 the cias phoenix program further degraded the vcs membership and capabilities. by the end of the year, the vc insurgents held almost no territory in south vietnam, and their recruitment dropped by over 80% in 1969, signifying a drastic reduction in guerrilla operations, necessitating increased use of pavn regular soldiers from the north. in 1969, north vietnam declared a provisional revolutionary government in south vietnam in an attempt to give the reduced vc a more international stature, but the southern guerrillas from then on were sidelined as pavn forces began more conventional combined arms warfare. by 1970, over 70% of communist troops in the south were northerners, and southern-dominated vc units no longer existed. operations crossed national borders: laos was invaded by north vietnam early on, while cambodia was used by north vietnam as a supply route starting in 1967; the route through cambodia began to be bombed by the u.s. in 1969, while the laos route had been heavily bombed since 1964. the deposing of the monarch norodom sihanouk by the cambodian national assembly resulted in a pavn invasion of the country at the request of the khmer rouge, escalating the cambodian civil war and resulting in a u.s.-arvn counter-invasion.in 1969, following the election of u.s president richard nixon, a policy of ""vietnamization"" began, which saw the conflict fought by an expanded arvn, with u.s. forces sidelined and increasingly demoralized by domestic opposition and reduced recruitment. u.s. ground forces had largely withdrawn by early 1972 and support was limited to air support, artillery support, advisers, and materiel shipments. the arvn, buttressed by said u.s. support, stopped the first and largest mechanized pavn offensive during the easter offensive of 1972. the offensive resulted in heavy casualties on both sides and the failure of the pavn to subdue south vietnam, but the arvn itself failed to recapture all territory, leaving its military situation difficult. the paris peace accords of january 1973 saw all u.s forces withdrawn; the case75,0000,000,000 laotians, and 58,220 u.s. service members also died in the conflict, and a further 1,626 remain missing in action.the sino-soviet split re-emerged following the lull during the vietnam war. conflict between north vietnam and its cambodian allies in the royal government of the national union of kampuchea, and the newly formed democratic kampuchea began almost immediately in a series of border raids by the khmer rouge, eventually escalating into the cambodian0th century. when the japanese invaded during world war ii, the viet minh opposed them with support from the us, the

the 1960 u.s. presidential election, senator john f. kennedy defeated incumbent vice president richard m. nixon. although eisenhower warned kennedy about laos and vietnam, europe and latin america ""loomed larger than asia on his sights."":264 in april 1961, kennedy approved the bay of pigs invasion and that invasion failed. in june 1961, he bitterly disagreed with soviet premier nikita khrushchev when they met in vienna to discuss key u.s.65, the construction of the berlin wall in august, and the cuban missile crisis in october. kennedy believed that yet another failure to gain control and stop communist expansion would irreparably damage u.s. credibility. he was determined to ""draw a line in the sand"" and prevent a communist victory in vietnam. he told james reston of the new york times immediately after his vienna summit meeting with khrushchev, ""now we have a problem making our power credible and vietnam looks like the place.""kennedys policy toward south vietnam assumed that di, john kenneth galbraith warned kennedy of the ""danger we shall replace the french as a colonial force in the area and bleed as the french did."" by november 1963, 16,000 american military personnel were stationed in south vietnam.:131the strategic hamlet program was initiated in late 1961. this joint u.s. and involved some forced relocation, village internment, and segregation of rural south vietnamese into new communities where the peasantry would be isolated from the viet cong. it was hoped these new communities would provide security for the peasants and strengthen the tie between them and the central government. however, by november 1963 the program had waned, and it officially ended in 1964.:1070on 23 july 1962, fourteen nations, including china, south vietnam, the soviet union, north vietnam and the united states, signed an agreement promising to respect the neutrality of laos.the inept performance of the arvn was exemplified by failed actions such as the battle of ap bac on 2 january 1963, in which a small band of viet cong won a battle against a much larger and better-equipped south vietnamese force, many of whose officers seemed reluctant even to engage in combat.:201, which he partly attributed to u.s. encouragement. as robert f. kennedy noted, ""di1 august 1963, the arvn special forces of colonel l43.the cia contacted generals planning to remove di november 1963. when kennedy was informed, maxwell taylor remembered that he ""rushed from the room with a look of shock and dismay on his face."":326 kennedy had not anticipated di7 kennedy wrote lodge a letter congratulating him for ""a fine job"".following the coup, chaos ensued. hanoi took advantage of the situation and increased its support for the guerrillas. south vietnam entered a period of extreme political instability, as one military government toppled another in quick succession. increasingly, each new regime was viewed by the communists as a puppet of the americans; whatever the failings of di8u.s. military advisors were embedded at every level of the south vietnamese armed forces. they were however criticized for ignoring the political nature of the insurgency. the kennedy administration sought to refocus u.s. efforts on pacification- which in this case was defined as countering the growing threat of insurgency-  and ""winning over the hearts and minds"" of the population. the military leadership in washington, however, was hostile to any role for u.s. advisors other than conventional troop training. general paul harkins, the commander of u.s. forces in south vietnam, confidently predicted victory by christmas 1963.:103 the cia was less optimistic, however, warning that ""the viet cong by and large retain de facto control of much of the countryside and have steadily increased the overall intensity of the effort"".paramilitary officers from the cias special activities division trained and led hmong tribesmen in laos and into vietnam. the indigenous forces numbered in the tens of thousands and they conducted direct action missions, led by paramilitary officers, against the communist pathet lao forces and their north vietnamese supporters. the cia also ran the phoenix program and participated in military assistance command, vietnam 2 november 1963. vice president lyndon b. johnson had not been heavily involved with policy toward vietnam; however, upon becoming president, johnson immediately focused on the war. on 24 november 1963, he said, ""the battle against communism members. this council was headed by general d some have argued that the policy of north vietnam was not to topple other non-communist governments in south east asia.:48on 2 august 1964, uss4 a second attack was reported two days later on uss18005 revealed that there was no attack on 4 august.the second ""attack"" led to retaliatory airstrikes, and prompted congress to approve the gulf of tonkin resolution on 7 august 1964.:78 the resolution granted the president power ""to take all necessary measures to repel any armed attack against the forces of the united states and to prevent further aggression"" and johnson would rely on this as giving him authority to expand the war.:221 in the same month, johnson pledged that he was not ""committing american boys to fighting a war that i think ought to be fought by the boys of asia to help protect their own land"".:227the national security council recommended a three-stage escalation of the bombing of north vietnam. following an attack on a u.s. army base in pleiku on 7 february 1965, a series of airstrikes was initiated, operation flaming dart, while soviet premier alexei kosygin was on a state visit to north vietnam. operation rolling thunder and operation arc light expanded aerial bombardment and ground support operations. the bombing campaign, which ultimately lasted three years, was intended to force north vietnam to cease its support for the viet cong by threatening to destroy north vietnamese air defenses and industrial infrastructure. it was additionally aimed at bolstering the morale of the south vietnamese. between march 1965 and november 1968, rolling thunder deluged the north with a million tons of missiles, rockets and bombs.:468bombing was not restricted to north vietnam. other aerial campaigns, such as operation barrel roll, targeted different parts of the viet cong and pavn infrastructure. these included the ho chi minh trail supply route, which ran through laos and cambodia. the ostensibly neutral laos had become the scene of a civil war, pitting the laotian government backed by the us against the pathet lao and its north vietnamese allies.massive aerial bombardment against the pathet lao and pavn forces were carried out by the us to prevent the collapse of the royal central government, and to deny the use of the ho chi minh trail. between 1964 and 1973, the u.s. dropped two million tons of bombs on laos, nearly equal to the 2.18following the gulf of tonkin resolution, hanoi anticipated the arrival of us troops and began expanding the viet cong, as well as sending increasing numbers of north vietnamese personnel southwards. at this phase they were outfitting the viet cong forces and standardising their equipment with ak-47 rifles and other supplies, as well as forming the 9th division.:223 ""from a strength of approximately 5,000 at the start of 1959 the viet congs ranks grew to about 100,000 at the end of 1964,000 in 1961, rising rapidly to 16,500 in 1964. during this phase, the use of captured equipment decreased, while greater numbers of ammunition and supplies were required to maintain regular units. group 559 was tasked with expanding the ho chi minh trail, in light of the near constant bombardment by us warplanes. the war had begun to shift into the final, conventional warfare phase of hanois three-stage protracted warfare model. the viet cong was now tasked with destroying the arvn and capturing and holding areas; however, the viet cong was not yet strong enough to assault major towns and cities.in december 1964, arvn forces had suffered heavy losses at the battle of b4600,000 by december.:349 stratofortress strategic bombers in a tactical support role.:284.15,000 people evacuated and rendered homeless during operation masher alone, which was the largest search and destroy operation in the war up to that point. operation masher would have negligible impact, however, as the pavn/vc returned to the province just four months after the operation ended.:1533%, american ambushes against viet cong/pavn forces for 9%, and american forces attacking viet cong emplacements for only 5% of all engagements.total engagementsare 66.2% of all engagementsengagement a virtual surprise to us commandersor vc/pavn alerted or anticipatedvc/pavn defensive perimetervc/pavn represent 14.3%of all engagementsin late 1967, the pavn lured american forces into the hinterlands at 6 days.:495 during that time, they had executed approximately 2,800 unarmed hu,100 arvn and 14,000 civilians were killed. by the end of the first offensive, after two months, nearly 5,000 arvn and over 4,000 u.s. forces had been killed and 45,820 wounded.  the u.s. claimed 17,000 of the pavn and viet cong had been killed and 15,000 wounded.:104:82 a month later a second offensive known as the may offensive was launched; although less widespread, it demonstrated the viet cong were still capable of carrying out orchestrated nationwide offensives.:48867 killed and 111,179 total casualties. by then it had become the bloodiest year of the war up to that point. the failure to spark a general uprising and the lack of defections among the arvn units meant both war goals of hanoi had fallen flat at enormous costs.:1486 percent."":546 the american public and media began to turn against johnson as the three offensives contradicted claims of progress made by the johnson administration and the military.at one point in 1968, westmoreland considered the use of nuclear weapons in vietnam in a contingency plan codenamed fracture jaw, which was abandoned when it became known to the white house. westmoreland requested 200,000 additional troops, which was leaked to the media, and the subsequent fallout combined with intelligence failures caused him to be removed from command in march 1968, succeeded by his deputy creighton abrams.on 10 may 1968, peace talks began between the united states and north vietnam in paris. negotiations stagnated for five months, until johnson gave orders to halt the bombing of north vietnam. at the same time, hanoi realized it could not achieve a ""total victory"" and employed a strategy known as ""talking while fighting, fighting while talking"", in which military offensives would occur concurrently with negotiations.johnson declined to run for re-election as his approval rating slumped from 48 to 36 percent.:486 his escalation of the war in vietnam divided americans into warring camps, cost 30,000 american lives by that point and was regarded to have destroyed his presidency.:486 refusal to send more u.s. troops to vietnam was also seen as johnsons admission that the war was lost. as secretary of defense robert mcnamara noted, ""the dangerous illusion of victory by the united states was therefore dead."":367vietnam was a major political issue during the united states presidential election in 1968. the election was won by republican party candidate richard nixon who claimed to have a secret plan to end the war.:515u.s. president richard nixon began troop withdrawals in 1969. his plan to build up the arvn so that it could take over the defense of south vietnam became known as ""vietnamization"". as the pavn/vc recovered from their 1968 losses and generally avoided contact, creighton abrams conducted operations aimed at disrupting logistics, with better use of firepower and more cooperation with the arvn.:517 on 27 october 1969, nixon had ordered a squadron of 18 b-52s loaded with nuclear weapons to race to the border of soviet airspace to convince the soviet union, in accord with the madman theory, that he was capable of anything to end the vietnam war. nixon had also sought d7205 large-scale offensives were rolled back in favour of small-unit and sapper attacks as well as targeting the pacification and vietnamization strategy. in the two-year period following tet, the pavn had begun its transformation from a fine light-infantry, limited mobility force into a high-mobile and mechanised combined arms force.:189the anti-war movement was gaining strength in the united states. nixon appealed to the ""silent majority"" of americans who he said supported the war without showing it in public. but revelations of the 1968 my lai massacre,:5181 in which a u.s. army unit raped and killed civilians, and the 1969 ""green beret affair"", where eight special forces soldiers, including the 5th special forces group commander, were arrested for the murder of a suspected double agent, provoked national and international outrage.in 1971, the pentagon papers were leaked to the new york times. the top-secret history of u.s. involvement in vietnam, commissioned by the department of defense, detailed a long series of public deceptions on the part of the u.s. government. the supreme court ruled that its publication was legal.following the tet offensive and the decreasing support among the u.s. public for the war, u.s. forces began a period of morale collapse, disillusionment and disobedience.:349.5% chose infantry combat positions in 1969,459 by 1971, and reached an all-time low of 33,220 in 1974, depriving u.s. forces of much-needed military leadership.open refusal to engage in patrols or carry out orders and disobedience began to emerge during this period, with one notable case of an entire company refusing orders to engage or carry out operations. unit cohesion began to dissipate and focused on minimising contact with viet cong and pavn.: a practice known as ""sand-bagging"" started occurring, where units ordered to go on patrol would go into the country-side, find a site out of view from superiors and rest while radioing in false coordinates and unit reports.:4076 from 1969 on, search-and-destroy operations became referred to as ""search and evade"" or ""search and avoid"" operations, falsifying battle reports while avoiding guerrilla fighters. a total of 900 fragging and suspected fragging incidents were investigated, most occurring between 1969 and 1971.:331:407 in 1969, field-performance of the u.s. forces was characterised by lowered morale, lack of motivation, and poor leadership.:331 the significant decline in u.s. morale was demonstrated by the battle of fsb mary ann in march 1971, in which a sapper attack inflicted serious losses on the u.s. defenders.:357 william westmoreland, no longer in command but tasked with investigation of the failure, cited a clear dereliction of duty, lax defensive postures and lack of officers in charge as its cause.:357on the collapse of u.s. morale, historian shelby stanton wrote:in the last years of the armys retreat, its remaining forces were relegated to static security. the american armys decline was readily apparent in this final stage. racial incidents, drug abuse, combat disobedience, and crime reflected growing idleness, resentment, and frustration... the fatal handicaps of faulty campaign strategy, incomplete wartime preparation, and the tardy, superficial attempts at vietnamization. an entire american army was sacrificed on the battlefield of vietnam.:36665,500. by 1970, viet cong forces were no longer southern-majority, as nearly 70% of units were northerners. between 1969 and 1971 the viet cong and some pavn units had reverted to small unit tactics typical of 1967 and prior instead of nationwide grand offensives.: in 1971, australia and new zealand withdrew their soldiers and u.s. troop count was further reduced to 196,700, with a deadline to remove another 45,000 troops by february 1972. the united states also reduced support troops, and in march 1971 the 5th special forces group, the first american unit deployed to south vietnam, withdrew to fort bragg, north carolina.:240prince norodom sihanouk had proclaimed cambodia neutral since 1955, but permitted the pavn/viet cong to use the port of sihanoukville and the sihanouk trail. in march 1969 nixon launched a massive secret bombing campaign, called operation menu, against communist sanctuaries along the cambodia/vietnam border. only five high-ranking congressional officials were informed of operation menu.in march 1970, prince sihanouk was deposed by his pro-american prime minister lon nol, who demanded that north vietnamese troops leave cambodia or face military action.  lon nol began rounding up vietnamese civilians in cambodia into internment camps and massacring them, provoking harsh reactions from both the north vietnamese and south vietnamese government. north vietnam invaded cambodia at the request of the khmer rouge following negotiations with deputy leader nuon chea. in april8vietnamization was again tested by the easter offensive of 1972, a massive conventional pavn invasion of south vietnam. the pavn quickly overran the northern provinces and in coordination with other forces attacked from cambodia, threatening to cut the country in half. u.s. troop withdrawals continued, but american airpower responded, beginning operation linebacker, and the offensive was halted.:606 u.s. presidential election as nixons opponent, george mcgovern, campaigned on immediate withdrawal. nixons national security advisor, henry kissinger, had continued secret negotiations with north vietnams l reached an agreement. president thieu demanded changes to the peace accord upon its discovery, and when north vietnam went public with the agreements details, the nixon administration claimed they were attempting to embarrass the president. the negotiations became deadlocked when hanoi demanded new changes. to show his support for south vietnam and force hanoi back to the negotiating table, nixon ordered operation linebacker ii, a massive bombing of hanoi and haiphong 189 december 1972.:6497 january 1973.:50800,000 communist troops to remain in the south, and agreed to a pow exchange. there was a sixty-day period for the total withdrawal of u.s. forces. ""this article"", noted peter church, ""proved60in the lead-up to the ceasefire on 28 january, both sides attempted to maximize the land and population under their control in a campaign known as the war of the flags. fighting continued after the ceasefire, this time without us participation, and continued throughout the year.:508pavn/vc leaders expected the ceasefire terms would favor their side, but saigon, bolstered by a surge of u.s. aid received just before the ceasefire went into effect, began to roll back the viet cong. the pavn/vc responded with a new strategy hammered out in a series of meetings in hanoi in march 1973, according to the memoirs of tr5,000 south vietnamese casualties during the ceasefire period.:683the success of the 197375, a limited offensive into the central

northern provinces came to an end.:699n l1 april, he left for taiwan on 25 april.:714 after having appealed unsuccessfully to congress for $7003 april, declaring an end to the vietnam war and all u.s. aid.by the end of april, the arvn had collapsed on all fronts except in the mekong delta. thousands of refugees streamed southward, ahead of the main communist onslaught. on 27 april 100,000 pavn troops encircled saigon. the city was defended by about 30,000 arvn troops. to hasten a collapse and foment panic, the pavn shelled tan son nhut airport and forced its closure. with the air exit closed, large numbers of civilians found that they had no way out.:716chaos, unrest, and panic broke out as hysterical south vietnamese officials and civilians scrambled to leave saigon. martial law was declared. american helicopters began evacuating south vietnamese, u.s. and foreign nationals from various parts of the city and from the u.s. embassy compound. operation frequent wind had been delayed until the last possible moment, because of u.s. ambassador graham martins belief that saigon could be held and that a political settlement could be reached. frequent wind was the largest helicopter evacuation in history. it began on 29 april, in an atmosphere of desperation, as hysterical crowds of vietnamese vied for limited space. frequent wind continued around the clock, as pavn tanks breached defenses near saigon. in the early morning hours of 30 april, the last u.s. marines evacuated the embassy by helicopter, as civilians swamped the perimeter and poured into the grounds.:7180on 30 april 1975, pavn troops entered the city of saigon and quickly overcame all resistance, capturing key buildings and installations. a tank from the 304th division crashed through the gates of the independence palace at 11:300,000 years of chinese-vietnamese enmity and hundreds of years of chinese and russian mutual suspicions were suspended when they united against us in vietnam.in 1950, china extended diplomatic recognition to the democratic republic of vietnam and sent heavy weapons, as well as military advisers led by luo guibo to assist the viet minh in its war with the french. the first draft of the 1954 geneva accords was negotiated by french prime minister pierre mend, mao zedong agreed to supply hanoi with 90,000 rifles and guns free of charge. starting in 1965, china sent anti-aircraft units and engineering battalions to north vietnam to repair the damage caused by american bombing, man anti-aircraft batteries, rebuild roads and railroads, transport supplies, and perform other engineering works. this freed north vietnamese army units for combat in the south. china sent 320,000 troops and annual arms shipments worth $18003"". which intended to find a treatment for malaria to provide the assistance to the pavn who suffered malaria. as a result, chinese scientist youyou tu and her collaborators discovered artemisinin. tu was awarded the nobel prize in 2015 for her contribution on the anti-malaria treatment.the chinese also began financing the khmer rouge as a counterweight to north vietnam at this time. china ""armed and trained"" the khmer rouge during the civil war and continued to aid them for years afterward. the khmer rouge launched ferocious raids into vietnam in 1975 bombers flying from okinawa and guam. their airspeed and direction would be noted and then relayed to cosvn, north vietnams southern headquarters. using airspeed and direction, cosvn analysts would calculate the bombing target and tell any assets to move ""perpendicularly to the attack trajectory."" these advance warnings gave them time to move out of the way of the bombers, and, while the bombing runs caused extensive damage, because of the early warnings from 1968 to 1970 they did not kill a single military or civilian leader in the headquarters complexes.the soviet union supplied north vietnam with medical supplies, arms, tanks, planes, helicopters, artillery, anti-aircraft missiles and other military equipment. soviet crews fired soviet-made surface-to-air missiles at u.s. f-4 phantoms, which were shot down over thanh h,000 tanks, 1,700 apcs, 7,000 artillery guns, over 5,000 anti-aircraft guns, 158 surface-to-air missile launchers, 120 helicopters. during the war, the soviets sent north vietnam annual arms shipments worth $450,mm"" which produced thousands of high-level documents for nearly a decade, including targets of b-52 strikes. in 1975, the sigint services had broken information from western us-allies in saigon, determining that the us would not intervene to save south vietnam from collapse.the czechoslovak socialist republic was a member of the warsaw pact and sent significant aid to north vietnam, both prior to and after the prague spring.:293 the czechoslovakian government created committees which sought to not only promote and establish peace, but also to promote victory for viet cong and pavn forces.: czech-made equipment and military aid would increase significantly following the prague spring. czechoslovakia continued to send tens of thousands of czech-made rifles as well as mortar and artillery throughout the war. in general, czechoslovakia was aligned with european leftist movements,: and there were simultaneous protests demonstrating against the soviet intervention in prague and the us intervention in vietnam.cooperation with czechoslovakia on the development of north vietnamese air capabilities began as early as 1956. czechoslovak instructors and trainers instructed the vpaf in china and helped them develop a modernised air force, with the czech-built aero ae-45 and aero l-29 delf6 aircraft utilised significantly for training, and regarded as preferential to soviet-built yakovlev yak-3 as training aircraft.as a result of a decision of the korean workers party in october 1966, in early 1967, north korea the contributions to north vietnam by the republic of cuba under fidel castro have been recognized several times by representatives of the democratic republic of vietnam. castro mentioned in his discourses the batall008 u.s. presidential candidate and a former vietnam prisoner of war, according to his 1999 book faith of my fathers.the ministry of public security of vietnam  in official vietnamese language histories on the vietnamese ministry of public security, the assistance provided by the soviet and east german intelligence services to vietnam is usually rated as the most important within the socialist bloc. east germany had also provided a substantial amount of aid to help north vietnam duplicate ""green dragon"" identity cards, which were created by saigon in order to identify north vietnamese combatants and were difficult to duplicate.east german authorities had also begun providing material and technical aid to help develop and modernise the north vietnamese economy and military. in addition, east germany had also vigorously denounced the us war effort, and had reaped significant international and diplomatic standing as a result of its anti-war campaigns.romania was also among primary supporters of north vietnam during the war in political, economic and military terms. contemporarily, the eastern bloc country was also known for its role in the mediation activities in the mid-1960s, resulting in what became known as the ""trinh signal"" in january 1967, in which hanoi accepted the possibility of negotiation with washington.bulgaria committed their charge-free military and economic supplies to north vietnam in a bilateral agreement signed in 1972. bulgarian military aid had already been provided to the latter since 1967. similar conducts was undertaken by hungary, which was reaffirmed in mutual visits of hungary and north vietnam in 1972 and 1973. hungary also expressed their support through their representatives at the international commission of control and supervision, a body established to supervise the implementation of the paris peace accords.as south vietnam was formally part of a military alliance with the us, australia, new zealand, france, the uk, pakistan, thailand and the philippines, the alliance was invoked during the war. the uk, france and pakistan declined to participate, and south korea and taiwan were non-treaty participants.on the anti-communist side, south korea  on 1 may 1964, lyndon johnson agreed to permit south korean participation under the many flags program in return for monetary compensation. the first south korean troops began arriving in 1964 and large combat formations began arriving a year later. the rok marine corps dispatched their 2nd marine brigade, while the rok army sent the capital division and later the 9th infantry division. in august 1966, after the arrival of the 9th division, the koreans established a corps command, the republic of korea forces vietnam field command, near i field force at nha trang.:state department reports publicly questioned the usefulness of rok forces in the conflict, as they have ""appeared to have been reluctant to undertake offensive operations, and are only useful in guarding a small sector of the populated area"". state department reports furthermore state that rok forces engaged in systemic, well-organised corruption in diverting us-equipment, and that actual security was often provided by south vietnamese regional forces, which lacked organic firepower and heavy artillery but served as a buffer between korean units and the pavn/vc. in addition, a rand author conducting studies in south vietnam in 1970 alleged that rok forces had a ""deliberate, systematic policy of committing atrocities"", prompting civilians to leave rok-controlled sectors. the conduct of rok forces often emboldened and strengthened the viet cong, adding ranks from an otherwise neutral population and undermining efforts to defeat the insurgency overall.approximately 320,000 south korean soldiers were sent to vietnam, each serving a one-year tour of duty. maximum troop levels peaked at 50,000 in 1968, however all were withdrawn by 1973. about 5,099 south koreans were killed and 10,962 wounded during the war. south korea claimed to have killed 41,000 viet cong. the united states paid south korean soldiers 236, and combat troops were committed in 1965.:555 combat troops and new zealands 552. around 50,190 australian personnel were involved during the war, of which 521 were killed and more than 3,000 wounded. approximately 3,500 new zealanders served in vietnam, with 37 killed and 187 wounded.:539 most australians and new zealanders served in the 1st australian task force in ph, recognised the necessity of a true counter-insurgency, which relied on providing village-level security, establishing civilian trust and economic incentives and improving arvn capabilities. this brought australian commanders into conflict with westmorelands conventional attrition warfare approach, since australian ground forces were required to follow us doctrine. nevertheless, australian forces were generally the most capable at counter-insurgency, and they helped to train regional forces despite being under significant doctrinal constraints.some 10,450 filipino troops were dispatched to south vietnam and primarily supported medical and other civilian pacification projects. these forces operated under the designation a or philippine civic action group-vietnam. the naval base at subic bay was used for the u.s. seventh fleet from 1964 until the end of the war in 1975. subic bay and clark air base achieved maximum functionality during the war, as well as supporting an estimated 80,000 locals in allied tertiary businesses that ranged from shoe making to prostitution.beginning in november 1967, taiwan secretly operated a cargo transport detachment to assist the united states and south vietnam. taiwan also provided military training units for the south vietnamese diving units, later known as the lien doi nguoi nhai :3 c, from a range of between 4,000 and 10,000 killed.: journalism in the ensuing years has documented other overlooked and uninvestigated war crimes involving every army division that was active in vietnam, including the atrocities committed by tiger force.u.s. forces established numerous free-fire zones as a tactic to prevent viet cong fighters from sheltering in south vietnamese villages. such practice, which involved the assumption that any individual appearing in the designated zones was an enemy combatant that could be freely targeted by weapons, is regarded by journalist lewis m. simons as ""a severe violation of the laws of war"". nick turse, in his 2013 book, kill anything that moves, argues that a relentless drive toward higher body counts, a widespread use of free-fire zones, rules of engagement where civilians who ran from soldiers or helicopters could be viewed as viet cong and a widespread disdain for vietnamese civilians led to massive civilian casualties and endemic war crimes inflicted by u.s. troops.:251 one example cited by turse is operation speedy express, an operation by the 9th infantry division, which was described by john paul vann as, in effect, ""many my lais"".:251 a report by newsweek magazine suggested that at least 5,000 civilians may have been killed during six months of the operation, and there were approximately 748 recovered weapons.r.j. rummel estimated that 39,000 were killed by south vietnam during the diem-era in democide from a range of between 16,000 and 167,000 south vietnamese civilians; for 1964 to 1975, rummel estimated 50,000 people were killed in democide, from a range of between 42,000 and 128,000. thus, the total for 1954 to 1975 is 81,000, from a range of between 57,000 and 284,000 deaths caused by south vietnam.: benjamin valentino attributes possibly 110,0006,000 to 41,000 civilian members of the prg/viet cong termed ""vc infrastructure"" were killed during the phoenix program, by us and south vietnamese intelligence and security, with an unknown number being innocent civilians.torture and ill-treatment were frequently applied by the south vietnamese to pows as well as civilian prisoners.:77 during their visit to the con son prison in 1970, u.s. congressmen augustus f. hawkins and william r. anderson witnessed detainees either confined in minute ""tiger cages"" or chained to their cells, and provided with poor-quality food. a group of american doctors inspecting the prison in the same year found many inmates suffering symptoms resulting from forced immobility and torture.:77 during their visits to transit detention facilities under american administration in 1968 and 1969, the international red cross recorded many cases of torture and inhumane treatment before the captives were handed over to south vietnamese authorities.:78 torture was conducted by the south vietnamese government in collusion with the cia.south korean forces were also accused of war crimes. one documented event was the phong nhnd marine brigade reportedly killed between 69 and 79 civilians on 12 february 1968 in phong nha massacre, binh tai massacre and h, c. 1973. statistics for 1968 suggest that ""about 80 percent of the terrorist victims were ordinary civilians and only about 20 percent were government officials, policemen, members of the self-defence forces or pacification cadres."":273 benjamin valentino attributes 45,0007052 civilians during the a in 1975. according to rummel, pavn and viet cong troops killed 164,000 civilians in democide between 1954 and 1975 in south vietnam, from a range of between 106,000 and 227,000 : north vietnam was also known for its abusive treatment of american pows, most notably in h prison :655american women served on active duty performing a variety of jobs. early in 1963, the army nurse corps :7 first lieutenant sharon lane was the only female military nurse to be killed by enemy gunfire during the war, on 8 june 1969.:57 one civilian doctor, eleanor ardel vietti, who was captured by viet cong on 30 may 1962, in bum became renowned after her diary was published following her death. the foreign minister for the viet cong and later the prg was also a woman, nguy6,000 of them were permitted to immigrate to the united states in the 1980s and 1990s.women also played a prominent role as front-line reporters in the conflict, directly reporting on the conflict as it occurred. a number of women volunteered on the north vietnamese side as embedded journalists, including author l3 days of captivity. webb would be the first western journalist to be captured and released, as well as cover the perspective of the viet cong in her memoir on the other side. another french-speaking journalist, catherine leroy, was briefly captured and released by north vietnamese forces during the battle of hu45the experience of american military personnel of african ancestry during the vietnam war had received significant attention. for example, the website ""african-american involvement in the vietnam war"" compiles examples of such coverage, as does the print and broadcast work of journalist wallace terry whose book bloods: an oral history of the vietnam war by black veterans civil rights leaders protested the disproportionate casualties and the overrepresentation in hazardous duty and combat roles experienced by african american servicemen, prompting reforms that were implemented beginning in 1967.5% of us combat deaths, approximately equal to percentage of draft-eligible black men, though still slightly higher than the 10% who served in the military.during the early stages of the war, the viet cong mainly sustained itself with captured arms; these were often of american manufacture or were crude, makeshift weapons used alongside shotguns made of galvanized pipes. most arms were captured from poorly defended arvn militia outposts. in 1967, all viet cong battalions were reequipped with arms of soviet design such as the ak-47 assault rifle, carbines and the rpg-2 anti-tank weapon.: their weapons were principally of chinese or soviet manufacture. in the period up to the conventional phase in 1970, the viet cong and pavn were primarily limited to 81 type 59 tank., btr-60, type 60 artillery, amphibious tanks  the pavn started receiving experimental soviet weapons against arvn forces, including manpads 9k32 strela-2 and anti-tank missiles, 9m14 malyutka. by 1975, they had fully transformed from the strategy of mobile light-infantry and using the peoples war concept used against the united states.the us service rifle was initially the m14. the m14 was a powerful, accurate rifle, but it was heavy, hard-recoiling, and especially unwieldy in jungle fighting, as it was unsuited for the combat conditions, often suffering from feed failure. it was gradually replaced by the m16 rifle, designed by eugene stoner, between 1964 and 1970. when first deployed, the m16 also suffered from a propensity to jam in combat, leaving the soldier defenseless and potentially killing him. according to a congressional report, the jamming was not related to operator error or to an inherent flaw in the rifle, but instead due to a change in the gunpowder to be used in the rifles cartridges, which led to rapid powder fouling of the action and failures to extract or feed cartridges. this decision, made after ""inadequate testing"", proved that ""the safety of soldiers was a secondary consideration."" the issue was solved in early 1968 with the issuance of the m16a1, featuring a chrome-plated bore, which reduced fouling, and the introduction of a cleaner-burning powder.:408 and mg-42, the u.s. replaced their earlier m1919 browning in most roles with the m60 machine gun, including on helicopters where it was used for suppressive fire. while its issues were not as severe as they were in the m14 or m16, the m60 still could fail to fire at crucial times - spent casings could get stuck inside of the chamber, meaning the barrel would have to be replaced before it could fire again.the ac-130 ""spectre"" gunship and the uh-1 ""huey"" gunship were used frequently during the war. the ac-130 was a heavily armed ground-attack aircraft variant of the c-130 hercules transport plane, while the huey is a military helicopter powered by a single, turboshaft engine; approximately 7,000 uh-1 aircraft saw service in vietnam. the u.s. heavily armored, 90 and f-4 phantom ii and other aircraft to launch napalm, white phosphorus, tear gas, chemical weapons, precision-guided munition and cluster bombs.the vietnam war was the first conflict where u.s. forces had secure voice communication equipment available at the tactical level. the national security agency ran a crash program to provide u.s. forces with a family of security equipment, codenamed nestor, fielding 17,000 units initially; eventually 30,000 units were produced. however, limitations of the units, including poor voice quality, reduced range, annoying time delays and logistical support issues, led to only one unit in ten being used. while many in the u.s. military believed that the viet cong and pavn would not be able to exploit insecure communications, interrogation of captured communication intelligence units showed they could understand the jargon and codes used in real time and were often able to warn their side of impending u.s. actions.:4,10the u.s. dropped over 7.1010.former u.s. air force official earl tilford has recounted ""repeated bombing runs of a lake in central cambodia. the b-52s literally dropped their payloads in the lake."" the air force ran many missions of this kind to secure additional funding during budget negotiations, so the tonnage expended does not directly correlate with the resulting damage.on 2 july 1976, north and south vietnam were merged to form the socialist republic of vietnam. despite speculation that the victorious north vietnamese would, in president nixons words, ""massacre the civilians there  by the millions,"" there is a widespread consensus that no mass executions took place. however, in the years following the war, a vast number of south vietnamese were sent to re-education camps where many endured torture, starvation, and disease while being forced to perform hard labor. according to amnesty international report 1979, this figure varied considerably depend on different observers: "" included such figures as ""50,000 to 80,000""  such variations may be because ""some estimates may include not only detainees but also people sent from the cities to the countryside."" according to a native observer, 443,360 people had to register for a period in re-education camps in saigon alone, and while some of them were released after a few days, others stayed there for more than a decade.gabriel garc50,000 people. of all the countries of indochina, laos experienced the largest refugee flight in proportional terms, as 300,000 people out of a total population of 300,000 to 400,000 vietnamese boat people died at sea, according to the united nations high commissioner for refugees.in the post-war era, americans struggled to absorb the lessons of the military intervention. as general maxwell taylor, one of the principal architects of the war, noted, ""first, we didnt know ourselves. we thought that we were going into another korean war, but this was a different country. secondly, we didnt know our south vietnamese allies3 president ronald reagan coined the term ""vietnam syndrome"" to describe the reluctance of the american public and politicians to support further military interventions abroad after vietnam. according to a 2004 gallup poll, 62 percent of americans believed it was an unjust war. us public polling in 1978 revealed that nearly 72% of americans believed the war was ""fundamentally wrong and immoral."" nearly a decade later, the number fell to 66%. in the past three decades, surveys have consistently shown that only around 35% of americans believe that the war was fundamentally wrong and immoral.:10 when surveyed in 2000, one third of americans believed that the war was a noble cause.:10failure of the war is often placed at different institutions and levels. some have suggested that the failure of the war was due to political failures of u.s. leadership. the official history of the united states army noted that ""tactics have often seemed to exist apart from larger issues, strategies, and objectives. yet in vietnam the army experienced tactical success and strategic failure... success rests not only on military progress but on correctly analysing the nature of the particular conflict, understanding the enemys strategy, and assessing the strengths and weaknesses of allies. a new humility and a new sophistication may form the best parts of a complex heritage left to the army by the long, bitter war in vietnam.""others point to a failure of u.s. military doctrine. secretary of defense robert mcnamara stated that ""the achievement of a military victory by u.s. forces in vietnam was indeed a dangerous illusion."":368 the inability to bring hanoi to the bargaining table by bombing also illustrated another u.s. miscalculation, and demonstrated the limitations of u.s. military abilities in achieving political goals.:17 as army chief of staff harold keith johnson noted, ""if anything came out of vietnam, it was that air power couldnt do the job."" even general william westmoreland admitted that the bombing had been ineffective. as he remarked, ""i still doubt that the north vietnamese would have relented."" u.s. secretary of state henry kissinger wrote in a secret memo to president gerald ford that ""in terms of military tactics, we cannot help draw the conclusion that our armed forces are not suited to this kind of war. even the special forces who had been designed for it could not prevail.""hanoi had persistently sought unification of the country since the geneva accords, and the effects of u.s. bombings had negligible impact on the goals of the north vietnamese government.:1the vietnam war pow/mia issue, concerning the fate of u.s. service personnel listed as missing in action, persisted for many years after the wars conclusion. the costs of the war loom large in american popular consciousness; a 1990 poll showed that the public incorrectly believed that more americans lost their lives in vietnam than in world war ii.between 1953 and 1975, the united states was estimated to have spent $168013, the u.s. government is paying vietnam veterans and their families or survivors more than $2220 american soldiers had been killed, more than 150,000 had been wounded, and at least 21,000 had been permanently disabled. the average age of the u.s. troops killed in vietnam was 23.11 years. according to dale kueter, ""of those killed in combat, 86.3 percent were white, 12.5 percent were black and the remainder from other races."" approximately 830,000 vietnam veterans suffered some degree of posttraumatic stress disorder  vietnam veterans suffered from ptsd in unprecedented numbers, as many as 15.2% of vietnam veterans, because the u.s. military had routinely provided heavy psychoactive drugs, including amphetamines, to american servicemen, which left them unable to process adequately their traumas at the time. an estimated 125,000 americans left for canada to avoid the vietnam draft, and approximately 50,000 american servicemen deserted. in 1977, united states president jimmy carter granted a full and unconditional pardon to all vietnam-era draft dodgers with proclamation 4483.as the vietnam war continued inconclusively and became more unpopular with the american public, morale declined and disciplinary problems grew among american enlisted men and junior, non-career officers. drug use, racial tensions, and the growing incidence of fragging although acknowledging serious problems, he questions the alleged ""near mutinous"" conduct of junior officers and enlisted men in combat. investigating one combat refusal incident, a journalist declared, ""a certain sense of independence, a reluctance to behave according to the militarys insistence on obedience, like pawns or puppets...the grunts  were determined to survive...they insisted of having something to say about the making of decisions that determined whether they might live or die."" the morale and discipline problems and resistance to conscription were important factors leading to the creation of an all-volunteer military force by the united states and the termination of conscription. the last conscript was inducted into the army in 1973. the all-volunteer military moderated some of the coercive methods of discipline previously used to maintain order in military ranks.:183one of the most controversial aspects of the u.s. military effort in southeast asia was the widespread use of chemical defoliants between 1961 and 1971. they were used to defoliate large parts of the countryside to prevent the viet cong from being able to hide their weapons and encampments under the foliage. these chemicals continue to change the landscape, cause diseases and birth defects, and poison the food chain.agent orange and similar chemical substances used by the u.s. have also caused a considerable number of deaths and injuries in the intervening years, including among the us air force crews that handled them. scientific reports have concluded that refugees exposed to chemical sprays while in south vietnam continued to experience pain in the eyes and skin as well as gastrointestinal upsets. in one study, ninety-two percent of participants suffered incessant fatigue; others reported monstrous births. meta-analyses of the most current studies on the association between agent orange and birth defects have found a statistically significant correlation such that having a parent who was exposed to agent orange at any point in their life will increase ones likelihood of either possessing or acting as a genetic carrier of birth defects. the most common deformation appears to be spina bifida. there is substantial evidence that the birth defects carry on for three generations or more. in 2012, the united states and vietnam began a cooperative cleaning up of the toxic chemical on part of danang international airport, marking the first time washington has been involved in cleaning up agent orange in vietnam.vietnamese victims affected by agent orange attempted a class action lawsuit against dow chemical and other u.s. chemical manufacturers, but the district court dismissed their case. they appealed, but the dismissal was cemented in february 2008 by the court of appeals for the second circuit. as of 2006, the vietnamese government estimates that there are over 4,000,000 victims of dioxin poisoning in vietnam, although the united states government denies any conclusive scientific links between agent orange and the vietnamese victims of dioxin poisoning. in some areas of southern vietnam, dioxin levels remain at over 100 times the accepted international standard.the u.s. veterans administration has listed prostate cancer, respiratory cancers, multiple myeloma, diabetes mellitus type 2, b-cell lymphomas, soft-tissue sarcoma, chloracne, porphyria cutanea tarda, peripheral neuropathy and spina bifida in children of veterans exposed to agent orange.estimates of the number of casualties vary, with one source suggesting up to 3.8002. a detailed demographic study calculated 791,000,000. a 1974 us senate subcommittee estimates nearly 1.454,256 killed between 1960 and 1974 and additional deaths from 1954 to 1959 and in 1975.:275 other estimates point to higher figures of 313,000 casualties. the official us department of defense figure was 950,765 pavn/vc forces killed in vietnam from 1965 to 1974. defense department officials believed that these body count figures need to be deflated by 30 percent. guenter lewy asserts that one-third of the reported ""enemy"" killed may have been civilians, concluding that the actual number of deaths of pavn/vc military forces was probably closer to 444,000.:45075,000 and 310,000 cambodians were estimated to have died during the war including between 50,000 and 150,000 combatants and civilians from us bombings. 20,000,000 laotians also died, and 58,318 u.s. military personnel were killed, of which 1,587 are still listed as missing as of july 2019.unexploded ordnance, mostly from u.s. bombing, continues to detonate and kill people today. according to the vietnamese government, ordnance has killed some 42,000 people since the war officially ended. according to the government of laos, unexploded ordnance has killed or injured over 20,000 laotians since the end of the war.the vietnam war has been featured extensively in television, film, video games, music and literature in the participant countries. in vietnam, one notable film set during operation linebacker ii was the film girl from hanoi  another vietnamese film produced was the abandoned field: free fire zone :the war also influenced a generation of musicians and songwriters in vietnam and the united states, both anti-war and pro/anti-communist. the band country joe and the fish recorded the ""fish"" cheer/i-feel-like-im-fixin-to-die rag in 1965, and it became one of the most influential anti-vietnam protest anthems.: many songwriters and musicians supported the anti-war movement, including pete seeger, joan baez, bob dylan, peggy seeger, ewan maccoll, barbara dane, the critics group, phil ochs, john lennon, john fogerty, nina simone, neil young, tom paxton, jimmy cliff and arlo guthrie. the modern classical composer george crumb composed a string quartet, a threnody, regarding the war in 1970 titled black angels.the war is also depicted in popular video games, especially in the first-person shooter war genre, such as line of sight: vietnam :373 attacking the previous orthodox and revisionist schools of american historiography of the vietnam war. this scholarship challenges myths about american society and soldiery in the vietnam war.:373kuzmarov in the myth of the addicted army: vietnam and the modern war on drugs challenges the popular and hollywood narrative that us soldiers were heavy drug users, in particular the notion that the my lai massacre was caused by drug use.:373 according to kuzmarov, richard nixon is primarily responsible for creating the drug myth.:374michael allen in until the last man comes home also accuses nixon of myth making, by exploiting the plight of the league of wives of american prisoners in vietnam and the national league of families of american prisoners and missing in southeast asia to allow the government to appear caring as the war was increasingly considered lost.:376 allens analysis ties the position of potential missing or prisoner americans into post-war politics and recent presidential elections, including the swift boat controversy in us electoral politics.:3765 may 2012, president barack obama issued a proclamation of the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the vietnam war. on 10 november 2017, president donald trump issued an additional proclamation commemorating the 50th anniversary of the vietnam war.the references for this article are grouped in three sections.",1,0
"free-range parenting is the concept of raising children in the spirit of encouraging them to function independently and with limited parental supervision, in accordance of their age of development and with a reasonable acceptance of realistic personal risks. seen as the opposite of helicopter parenting, the idea was popularized by pediatrician benjamin spock. a notable text of the movement is lenore skenazys book free-range kids: giving our children the freedom we had without going nuts with worry hoping to enhance psychoanalysis in the pediatric world, spock authored a book called the common sense book of baby and child care.  the book, which was released in 1946 and soon became a best seller, encouraged free-range parenting with the hopes of implementing freudian philosophy into child-rearing. american journalist lenore skenazy has written about the problems of overparenting and overprotection of kids with a particular emphasis on allowing kids to have appropriate levels of freedom and responsibility for their age while still keeping them safe.  her book, free range kids: giving our children the freedom we had without going nuts with worry describe what she sees as the horrors of mainstream schooling, parenting, and organised activities, highlighting the unnecessary protection from risk that limits childrens opportunity to mature properly into independent adults, and the unnecessary training, even in using flash cards for preschoolers, thereby limiting their opportunities for personal growth.in the united states, free-range parenting is limited by laws in many states restricting childrens autonomy, such as how old a child must be to walk to school alone. in massachusetts, such issues are generally addressed on a case-by-case basis. other states, such as delaware, or colorado, based on states child labor laws, will investigate reports of any child under the age of 12 being left alone, whereas other states, like north carolina, have fire laws that stipulate a child under 8 should not be left home alone. only three states specify a minimum age for leaving a child home alone. these include illinois which requires children to be 14 years old, in maryland, the minimum age is 8, and in oregon 10. the perception of what constitutes neglect varies a lot depending on the state law in place, the age of the children and if an injury occurred or not.in 2014 and 2015, parents in maryland were investigated by their local child protective services when their children walked home from a park unsupervised.in december 2015, however, new federal law contained an amendment added by sen. mike lee stating that:a caveat adds, ""...nothing in this section 10 shall be construed to preempt state or local laws.""in 2018, utah became the first state to enact legislation which explicitly protected parents right to ""free range"" their children.there is no legal consensus about when parents can leave their children unsupervised in canada.  however, according to section 218 of the criminal code of canada, a person who ""unlawfully abandons or exposes a child who is under the age of ten years, so that its life is or is likely to be endangered or its health is or is likely to be permanently injured"" commits a criminal offence. each province is responsible for its legal framework. red cross canada is offering a training course for children between the age of 9 and 13 in ontario, the law is very vague concerning the age at which children might be left alone. parents are responsible for their children until they are 16 years old but it does not mean that they should be under constant parental supervision. while a staying home age is not specified, parents are not permitted to leave their children unattended in vehicles.",1,0
"antarctica  is earths southernmost continent. it contains the geographic south pole and is situated in the antarctic region of the southern hemisphere, almost entirely south of the antarctic circle, and is surrounded by the southern ocean. at 14,200,000 square kilometres  which extends to all but the northernmost reaches of the antarctic peninsula.antarctica, on average, is the coldest, driest, and windiest continent, and has the highest average elevation of all the continents. most of antarctica is a polar desert, with annual precipitation of 20089.2nd century ce.  the roman authors hyginus and apuleius  from which derived the old french pole antartike the long-imagined in the nineteenth century, the colonial authorities in sydney removed the dutch name from new holland. instead of inventing a new name to replace it, they took the name australia from the south polar continent, leaving it nameless for some eighty years. during that period, geographers had to make do with clumsy phrases such as ""the antarctic continent"". they searched for a more poetic replacement, suggesting various names such as ultima and antipodea. eventually antarctica was adopted as continental name in the 1890s300: fabian gottlieb von bellingshausen  on 27 january 1820, which became known as the fimbul ice shelf. this happened three days before bransfield sighted the land of the trinity peninsula of antarctica, as opposed to the ice of an ice shelf, and ten months before palmer did so in november 1820. the first documented landing on antarctica was by the american sealer john davis, apparently at hughes bay, near cape charles, in west antarctica on 7 february 1821, although some historians dispute this claim. the first recorded and confirmed landing was at cape adair in 1895 on 22 january 1840, two days after the discovery of the coast west of the balleny islands, some members of the crew of the 18373, depicting the brig jane and the cutter beaufoynimrod expedition south pole party  mercator cooper landed in east antarctica on 26 january 1853.during the nimrod expedition led by ernest shackleton in 1907, parties led by edgeworth david became the first to climb mount erebus and to reach the south magnetic pole. douglas mawson, who assumed the leadership of the magnetic pole party on their perilous return, went on to lead several expeditions until retiring in 1931. in addition, shackleton and three other members of his expedition made several firsts in december 1908 8 november 1979, air new zealand flight 901, a mcdonnell douglas dc-10-30, crashed into mount erebus, killing all 257 people on board.in the southern hemisphere summer of 1996  making it the fifth-largest continent, about 1.3 times as large as europe. the coastline measures 17,9680004, a potentially active underwater volcano was found in the antarctic peninsula by american and canadian researchers.antarctica is home to more than 70 lakes that lie at the base of the continental ice sheet. lake vostok, discovered beneath russias vostok station in 1996, is the largest of these subglacial lakes. it was once believed that the lake had been sealed off for 500,000 to one million years, but a recent survey suggests that, every so often, there are large flows of water from one lake to another.there is some evidence, in the form of ice cores drilled to about 400008, a nasa team embarked on a mission to lake untersee, searching for extremophiles in its highly alkaline waters. if found, these resilient creatures could further bolster the argument for extraterrestrial life in extremely cold, methane-rich environments.in september 2018, researchers at the national geospatial-intelligence agency released a high resolution terrain map more than 170 million years ago, antarctica was part of the supercontinent gondwana. over time, gondwana gradually broke apart, and antarctica as we know it today was formed around 25 million years ago. antarctica was not always cold, dry, and covered in ice sheets. at a number of points in its long history, it was farther north, experienced a tropical or temperate climate, was covered in forests, and inhabited by various ancient life forms.during the cambrian period, gondwana had a mild climate. west antarctica was partially in the northern hemisphere, and during this period large amounts of sandstones, limestones and shales were deposited. east antarctica was at the equator, where sea floor invertebrates and trilobites flourished in the tropical seas. by the start of the devonian period as a result of continued warming, the polar ice caps melted and much of gondwana became a desert. in eastern antarctica, seed ferns or pteridosperms became abundant and large amounts of sandstone and shale were laid down at this time. synapsids, commonly known as ""mammal-like reptiles"", were common in antarctica during the early triassic and included forms such as lystrosaurus. the antarctic peninsula began to form during the jurassic period  and antarctopelta have been described to date. it was during this era that gondwana began to break up.however, there is some evidence of antarctic marine glaciation during the cretaceous period.the cooling of antarctica occurred stepwise, as the continental spread changed the oceanic currents from longitudinal equator-to-pole temperature-equalising currents to latitudinal currents that preserved and accentuated latitude temperature differences.africa separated from antarctica in the jurassic, around 160 ma, followed by the indian subcontinent in the early cretaceous  in the eocene epoch, about 40 ma australia-new guinea separated from antarctica, so that latitudinal currents could isolate antarctica from australia, and the first ice began to appear.  during the eocene levels have been found to be about 760 ppm and had been decreasing from earlier levels in the thousands of ppm.around 23 ma, the drake passage opened between antarctica and south america, resulting in the antarctic circumpolar current that completely isolated the continent. models of the changes suggest that declining co2 levels became more important. the ice began to spread, replacing the forests that until then had covered the continent. since about 15 ma, the continent has been mostly covered with ice.fossil nothofagus leaves in the meyer desert formation of the sirius group show that intermittent warm periods allowed nothofagus shrubs to cling to the dominion range as late as 3048 by the protocol on environmental protection to the antarctic treaty.antarctica is the coldest of earths continents. it used to be ice-free until about 34 million years ago, when it became covered with ice. the lowest natural air temperature ever recorded on earth was 89.294.72 metres antarctica is colder than the arctic for three reasons. first, much of the continent is more than 3,0001; two of his children were born on the island.emilio marcos palma was the first person born south of the 60th parallel south, the first born on the antarctic mainland, and the only living human to be the first born on any continent. he was born in 1978 at esperanza base, on the tip of the antarctic peninsula; his parents were sent there along with seven other families by the argentine government to determine if the continent was suitable for family life. in 1984, juan pablo camacho was born at the frei montalva station, becoming the first chilean born in antarctica. several bases are now home to families with children attending schools at the station. as of 2009, eleven children were born in antarctica  and three at the chilean frei montalva station.the terrestrial and native all year round species appears to be the descendants of ancestors who lived in geothermally warmed environments during the last ice age, when these areas were the only places on the continent not covered by ice.few terrestrial vertebrates live in antarctica, and those that do are limited to the sub-antarctic islands. invertebrate life includes microscopic mites like the alaskozetes antarcticus, lice, nematodes, tardigrades, rotifers, krill and springtails.  the flightless midge belgica antarctica, up to 6010. the research is part of the global census of marine life and has disclosed some remarkable findings. more than 235 marine organisms live in both polar regions, having bridged the gap of 12,0005 species of liverworts, but only three species of flowering plants, all of which are found in the antarctic peninsula: deschampsia antarctica  growth is restricted to a few weeks in the summer.seven hundred species of algae exist, most of which are phytoplankton. multicoloured snow algae and diatoms are especially abundant in the coastal regions during the summer. bacteria have been found living in the cold and dark as deep as 800015 norway formally defined queen maud land as including the unclaimed area between it and the south pole. antarcticas status is regulated by the 1959 antarctic treaty and other related agreements, collectively called the antarctic treaty system. antarctica is defined as all land and ice shelves south of 60012, the british foreign and commonwealth office named a previously unnamed area queen elizabeth land in tribute to queen elizabeth iis diamond jubilee. on 22 december 2012, the uk ambassador to argentina, john freeman, was summoned to the argentine government as protest against the claim. argentine012 due to disputes over the sovereignty of the nearby falkland islands, and the 30th anniversary of the falklands war.the areas shown as australias and new zealands claims were british territory until they were handed over following the countries independence. australia currently claims the largest area. the claims of britain, australia, new zealand, france and norway are all recognised by each other.other countries participating as members of the antarctic treaty have a territorial interest in antarctica, but the provisions of the treaty do not allow them to make their claims while it is in force.there is no economic activity in antarctica at present, except for fishing off the coast and small-scale tourism, both based outside antarctica.although coal, hydrocarbons, iron ore, platinum, copper, chromium, nickel, gold and other minerals have been found, they have not been in large enough quantities to exploit. the 1991 protocol on environmental protection to the antarctic treaty also restricts a struggle for resources. in 1998, a compromise agreement was reached to place an indefinite ban on mining, to be reviewed in 2048, further limiting economic development and exploitation. the primary economic activity is the capture and offshore trading of fish. antarctic fisheries in 2000,934 tonnes.small-scale ""expedition tourism"" has existed since 1957 and is currently subject to antarctic treaty and environmental protocol provisions, but in effect self-regulated by the international association of antarctica tour operators  as of 2015, there are two wells fargo atms in antarctica.there has been some concern over the potential adverse environmental and ecosystem effects caused by the influx of visitors. some environmentalists and scientists have made a call for stricter regulations for ships and a tourism quota. the primary response by antarctic treaty parties has been to develop, through their committee for environmental protection and in partnership with iaato, ""site use guidelines"" setting landing limits and closed or restricted zones on the more frequently visited sites. antarctic sightseeing flights about thirty countries maintain about seventy research stations the iso 3166-1 alpha-2 ""aq"" is assigned to the entire continent regardless of jurisdiction.  different country calling codes and currencies are used for different settlements, depending on the administrating country.  the antarctican dollar, a souvenir item sold in the united states and canada, is not legal tender.each year, scientists from 28 different nations conduct experiments not reproducible in any other place in the world. in the summer more than 4,000 scientists operate research stations; this number decreases to just over 1,000 in the winter. mcmurdo station, which is the largest research station in antarctica, is capable of housing more than 1,000 scientists, visitors, and tourists.researchers include biologists, geologists, oceanographers, physicists, astronomers, glaciologists, and meteorologists. geologists tend to study plate tectonics, meteorites from outer space, and resources from the breakup of the supercontinent gondwana. glaciologists in antarctica are concerned with the study of the history and dynamics of floating ice, seasonal snow, glaciers, and ice sheets. biologists, in addition to examining the wildlife, are interested in how harsh temperatures and the presence of people affect adaptation and survival strategies in a wide variety of organisms. medical physicians have made discoveries concerning the spreading of viruses and the bodys response to extreme seasonal temperatures. astrophysicists at amundsen006 nasa satellite data revealed that the antarctic ozone hole was larger than at any other time on record, at 2,750,000  the impacts of the depleted ozone layer on climate changes occurring in antarctica are not well understood.in 2007 the polar geospatial center was founded.  the polar geospatial center uses geospatial and remote sensing technology to provide mapping services to american federally funded research teams.  currently, the polar geospatial center can image all of antarctica at 500007 belgian-based international polar foundation unveiled the princess elisabeth station, the worlds first zero-emissions polar science station in antarctica to research climate change. costing $16.3 million, the prefabricated station, which is part of the international polar year, was shipped to the south pole from belgium by the end of 2008 to monitor the health of the polar regions. belgian polar explorer alain hubert stated: ""this base will be the first of its kind to produce zero emissions, making it a unique model of how energy should be used in the antarctic."" johan berte is the leader of the station design team and manager of the project which conducts research in climatology, glaciology and microbiology.in january 2008 british antarctic survey a study from 2014 estimated that during the pleistocene, the east antarctic ice sheet meteorites from antarctica are an important area of study of material formed early in the solar system; most are thought to come from asteroids, but some may have originated on larger planets. the first meteorite was found in 1912 and named the adelie land meteorite. in 1969, a japanese expedition discovered nine meteorites. most of these meteorites have fallen onto the ice sheet in the last million years. motion of the ice sheet tends to concentrate the meteorites at blocking locations such as mountain ranges, with wind erosion bringing them to the surface after centuries beneath accumulated snowfall. compared with meteorites collected in more temperate regions on earth, the antarctic meteorites are well-preserved.this large collection of meteorites allows a better understanding of the abundance of meteorite types in the solar system and how meteorites relate to asteroids and comets. new types of meteorites and rare meteorites have been found. among these are pieces blasted off the moon, and probably mars, by impacts. these specimens, particularly alh84001 discovered by ansmet, are at the centre of the controversy about possible evidence of microbial life on mars. because meteorites in space absorb and record cosmic radiation, the time elapsed since the meteorite hit the earth can be determined from laboratory studies. the elapsed time since fall, or terrestrial residence age, of a meteorite represents more information that might be useful in environmental studies of antarctic ice sheets.in 2006, a team of researchers from ohio state university used gravity measurements by nasas grace satellites to discover the 500-kilometre-wide in january 2013, an 18015, reports emerged of a 2-kilometre melting of floating ice shelves on the continent itself, the large volume of ice present stores around 70% of the worlds fresh water. this ice sheet is constantly gaining ice from snowfall and losing ice through outflow to the sea.sheperd et al. 2012, found that different satellite methods for measuring ice mass and change were in good agreement and combining methods leads to more certainty with east antarctica, west antarctica, and the antarctic peninsula changing in mass by +14 65 6, and 20 018 systematic review study estimated that ice loss across the entire continent was 43 gigatonnes per year on average during the period from 1992 to 2002 but has accelerated to an average of 220 gigatonnes per year during the five years from 2012 to 2017. nasas climate change website indicates a compatible overall trend of greater than 100 gigatonnes of ice loss per year since 2002.a single 2015 study by h. jay zwally et al. found instead that the net change in ice mass is slightly positive at approximately 82 gigatonnes per year  however, one critic, eric rignot of nasas jet propulsion laboratory, states that this outlying studys findings ""are at odds with all other independent methods: re-analysis, gravity measurements, mass budget method, and other groups using the same data"" and appears to arrive at more precise values than current technology and mathematical approaches would permit.a satellite record revealed that the overall increase in antarctic sea ice extents reversed in 2014, with rapid rates of decrease in 2014017 reducing the antarctic sea ice extents to their lowest values in the 40-y record.east antarctica is a cold region with a ground base above sea level and occupies most of the continent. this area is dominated by small accumulations of snowfall which becomes ice and thus eventually seaward glacial flows. the mass balance of the east antarctic ice sheet as a whole is thought to be slightly positive  however, increased ice outflow has been suggested in some regions.some of antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the antarctic peninsula. a study by eric steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05002 the antarctic peninsulas larsen-b ice shelf collapsed. between 28 february and 8 march 2008, about 570  prior to its collapse on 5 april 2009. according to nasa, the most widespread antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to california briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5013 identified central west antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on earth. the researchers present a complete temperature record from antarcticas byrd station and assert that it ""reveals a linear increase in annual temperature between 1958 and 2010 by 2.4020, the region recorded the highest temperature of 18.3008, when the longest lasting hole on record remained until the end of december. the hole was detected by scientists in 1985 and has tended to increase over the years of observation. the ozone hole is attributed to the emission of chlorofluorocarbons or cfcs into the atmosphere, which decompose the ozone into other gases. in 2019, the ozone hole was at its smallest in the previous thirty years, due to the warmer polar stratosphere weakening the polar vortex. this reduced the formation of the polar stratospheric clouds that enable the chemistry that leads to rapid ozone loss.some scientific studies suggest that ozone depletion may have a dominant role in governing climatic change in antarctica  ozone absorbs large amounts of ultraviolet radiation in the stratosphere. ozone depletion over antarctica can cause a cooling of around 6\xb0e\xef\xbb\xbf /

"baking is a method of preparing food that uses  dry heat, typically in an oven,but can also be done in hot ashes, or on hot stones. the most common baked item is bread but many other types of foods are baked. heat is gradually transferred ""from the surface of cakes, cookies, and breads to their center. as heat travels through, it transforms batters and doughs into baked goods and more with a firm dry crust and a softer center"". baking can be combined with grilling to produce a hybrid barbecue variant by using both methods simultaneously, or one after the other. baking is related to barbecuing because the concept of the masonry oven is similar to that of a smoke pit.because of historical social and familial roles, baking has traditionally been performed at home by women for day-to-day meals and by men in bakeries and restaurants for local consumption. when production was industrialized, baking was automated by machines in large factories. the art of baking remains a fundamental skill and is important for nutrition, as baked goods, especially breads, are a common and important food, both from an economic and cultural point of view. a person who prepares baked goods as a profession is called a baker. on a related note, a pastry chef is someone who is trained in the art of making pastries, desserts, bread and other baked goods.all types of food can be baked, but some require special care and protection from direct heat. various techniques have been developed to provide this protection.in addition to bread, baking is used to prepare cakes, pastries, pies, tarts, quiches, cookies, scones, crackers, pretzels, and more. these popular items are known collectively as ""baked goods,"" and are often sold at a bakery, which is a store that carries only baked goods, or at markets, grocery stores, farmers markets or through other venues.meat, including cured meats, such as ham can also be baked, but baking is usually reserved for meatloaf, smaller cuts of whole meats, or whole meats that contain stuffing or coating such as bread crumbs or buttermilk batter. some foods are surrounded with moisture during baking by placing a small amount of liquid  the paste was cooked by pouring it onto a flat, hot rock, resulting in a bread-like substance. later, when humans mastered fire, the paste was roasted on hot embers, which made bread-making easier, as it could now be made any time fire was created. the worlds oldest oven was discovered in croatia in 2014 dating back 6500 years ago. the ancient egyptians baked bread using yeast, which they had previously been using to brew beer. bread baking began in ancient greece around 600 bc, leading to the invention of enclosed ovens. ""ovens and worktables have been discovered in archaeological digs from turkey baking flourished during the roman empire. beginning around 300 b.c., the pastry cook became an occupation for romans eventually, the roman art of baking became known throughout europe and eventually spread to eastern parts of asia. by the 13th century in london, commercial trading, including baking, had many regulations attached. in the case of food, they were designed to create a system ""so there was little possibility of false measures, adulterated food or shoddy manufactures."" there were by that time twenty regulations applying to bakers alone, including that every baker had to have ""the impression of his seal"" upon bread.beginning in the 19th century, alternative leavening agents became more common, such as baking soda. bakers often baked goods at home and then sold them in the streets. this scene was so common that rembrandt, among others, painted a pastry chef selling pancakes in the streets of germany, with children clamoring for a sample. in london, pastry chefs sold their goods from handcarts. this developed into a delivery system of baked goods to households and greatly increased demand as a result. in paris, the first open-air caf\xa0... in 1840, she plucked up courage and asked for a tray of tea, bread and butter, and cake to be brought to her room. once she had formed the habit she found she could not break it, so spread it among her friends instead. as the century progressed, afternoon tea became increasingly elaborate.""benedictine sisters of the benedectine monastery of caltanissetta producing the crocette, they used to be prepared for the holy crucifix festivity. this was situated next to the church of the holy cross, from which the sweets take the name.for jews, matzo is a baked product of considerable religious and ritual significance. baked matzah bread can be ground up and used in other dishes, such as gefilte fish, and baked again. for christians, bread has to be baked to be used as an essential component of the sacrament of the eucharist. in the eastern christian tradition, baked bread in the form of birds is given to children to carry to the fields in a spring ceremony that celebrates the forty martyrs of sebaste.",1,0
"coordinates: 4634018484; 6.13349rolex sa  originally founded as wilsdorf and davis by hans wilsdorf and alfred davis in london, england in 1905, the company registered rolex as the brand name of its watches in 1908 and became rolex watch co. ltd. in 1915. after world war i, the company moved its base of operations to geneva due to the unfavorable economic situation in post-war britain, and in 1920 hans wilsdorf registered montres rolex sa in geneva as the new company name which eventually became rolex sa in later years. since 1960, the company has been owned by the hans wilsdorf foundation, a private family trust.rolex sa and its subsidiary montres tudor sa design, manufacture, distribute and service wristwatches sold under the rolex and tudor brands. in 2018, forbes ranked rolex as the worlds 71st most valuable brand. as of june 2019, among the worlds top ten most expensive watches ever sold at auctions, three are rolex watches. in particular, paul newmans rolex daytona currently holds the title of the second most expensive wristwatch and the third most expensive watch ever sold at auction, fetching 17.75 million us dollars in new york on october 26, 2017.   rolex is the largest manufacturer of swiss made certified chronometers.  in 2005, more than half the annual production of watches certified by  contr0 the companys name was officially changed to montres rolex s.a. and later to rolex s.a.with administrative worries attended to, wilsdorf turned the companys attention to a technical challenge: the infiltration of dust and moisture under the dial and crown, which damaged the movement. to address this problem, in 1926 rolex developed and produced a waterproof and dustproof wristwatch, giving it the name ""oyster"". the watch featured a hermetically sealed case which provided optimal protection for the movement.consumers at the time remained skeptical of a fully waterproof watch. as a demonstration, rolex submerged oyster models in aquariums, which it displayed in the windows of its main points of sale. in 1927, british swimmer mercedes gleitze swam across the english channel with an oyster on her wrist, becoming the first rolex ambassador. to celebrate the feat, rolex published a full-page advertisement on the front page of the daily mail proclaiming the watchs success during the ten hour plus swim.in 1931, rolex patented a self-winding mechanism called a perpetual rotor, a semi-circular plate that relies on gravity to move freely. its system was the first wristwatch to use a 360008, following the abrupt departure of chief executive patrick heiniger for ""personal reasons"", rolex sa denied that it had lost 1013.rolex sa is owned by the private hans wilsdorf foundation, which is registered as a charity and does not pay corporate income taxes. in 2011, a spokesman for rolex declined to provide evidence regarding the amount of charitable donations made by the wilsdorf foundation. in geneva where the company is based, it is said to have gifted, among many things, two housing buildings to social institutions of geneva.according to the 2017 brand z report, the brand value is estimated $8.053 billion. rolex watches continue to have a reputation as status symbols. it produces more than 800,000 timepieces each year. it is said that ""the power of the crown is never more felt than when trying to negotiate space in a retail environment for the product of another brand"".rolex sa offers products under the rolex and tudor brands. montres tudor  rolex founder hans wilsdorf conceived of the tudor watch company to create a product for authorized rolex dealers to sell that offered the reliability and dependability of a rolex, but at a lower price. the number of rolex watches was limited by the rate that they could produce in-house rolex movements, thus tudor watches were originally equipped with off-the-shelf movements while using similar quality cases and bracelets.historically, tudor watches have been manufactured by montres tudor sa using movements supplied by eta sa. since 2015 tudor has begun to manufacture watches with in-house movements. the first model introduced with a in-house movement was the tudor north flag. following this, updated versions of the tudor pelagos and tudor heritage black bay have also been fitted with an in-house caliber.tudor watches are marketed and sold in most countries around the world. montres tudor sa discontinued sales of tudor-branded watches in the united states in 2004, but tudor returned to the united states market in the summer of 2013 and to the uk in 2014.one of rolexs company slogans is ""a crown for every achievement"".rolex mostly produced mechanical watches, but it has also participated in the development of the original quartz watch movements. although rolex has made very few quartz models for its oyster line, the companys engineers were instrumental in design and implementation of the technology during the late 1960s and early 1970s. in 1968, rolex collaborated with a consortium of 16 swiss watch manufacturers to develop the beta 21 quartz movement used in their rolex quartz date 5100 alongside other manufactures including the omega electroquartz watches. within about five years of research, design, and development, rolex created the ""clean-slate"" 5035/5055 movement that would eventually power the rolex oysterquartz.material-wise, rolex first used its ""cerachrom"" ceramic bezel on the gmt-master ii in 2005, and has since then implemented ceramic bezel inserts across the range of professional sports watches. they are available on the submariner, sea dweller, deepsea, gmt master ii and daytona models. in contrast to the aluminum bezel which it replaced, the ceramic bezel color does not wear out from exposure to uv-light and is very scratch resistant.rolex also uses 904l grade stainless-steel. most swiss watches are made with 316l grade steel.  rolex uses the higher grade, as it is more resistant to corrosion and when polished, leaves a beautiful luster.among the companys innovations are:rolex watches are frequently counterfeited, and these are often illegally sold on the street and online. counterfeit rolex watches vary in quality: some use the cheapest of movements, while others use automatic movements, and some use an eta movement. however, the majority of these counterfeit watches are easily identifiable by jewellers and other experts. o. j. simpson wore a counterfeit rolex during his 1994 murder trial.in december 2018, world wide fund for nature rolex founder hans wilsdorf created the air-king line to honor raf pilots of the battle of britain, releasing the first model in 1958. by 2007, the 1142xx iteration of the air-king featured a cosc-certified movement in a 34mm case, considered by some a miniaturized variant of the 39mm rolex explorer as both watches featured very similar styling cues; the 34mm air-king lineup was the least expensive series of oyster perpetual. in 2014 the air-king was dropped, making the oyster perpetual 26/31/34/36/39 the entry-level rolex line. in 2016 rolex reintroduced the air-king, available as a single model the name of the watch line in catalogs is often ""rolex oyster  ______"" or ""rolex oyster perpetual ______""; rolex oyster and oyster perpetual are generic names and not specific product lines, except for the oyster perpetual 26/31/34/36/39/41 and oyster perpetual date 34.the rolex oyster perpetual watch is a direct descendant of the original watertight rolex oyster watch created in 1926. within the oyster perpetual  lineup, there are three different movements; the 39 features the caliber 3132 movement with the parachrom hairspring and paraflex shock absorbers  the oyster perpetual date 34  in 2016, rolex released the datejust 41, which has the same 41mm diameter case as the datejust ii, however the datejust 41 has smaller indexes and a thinner bezel compared to the datejust ii.rolex produced specific models suitable for the extremes of deep-sea diving, caving, mountain climbing, polar exploration, and aviation. early professional models included the rolex submariner   the 42mm rolex explorer ii has some significant differences from the 39mm explorer; the explorer ii adds a date function, and an orange 24-hour hand which is paired with the fixed bezels black 24-hour markers for situations underground or around the poles where day cannot be distinguished from night.another iconic model is the rolex gmt master by the start of world war ii royal air force pilots were buying rolex watches to replace their inferior standard-issue watches. however, when captured and sent to prisoner of war  when hans wilsdorf heard of this, he offered to replace all watches that had been confiscated and not require payment until the end of the war, if the officers would write to rolex and explain the circumstances of their loss and where they were being held. wilsdorf was in personal charge of the scheme. as a result of this, an estimated 3,000 rolex watches were ordered by british officers in the officer camp oflag vii-b in bavaria alone. this had the effect of raising the morale among the allied pows because it indicated that wilsdorf did not believe that the axis powers would win the war. american servicemen heard about this when stationed in europe during wwii and this helped open up the american market to rolex after the war.on 10 march 1943, while still a prisoner of war, corporal clive james nutting, one of the organizers of the great escape, ordered a stainless steel rolex oyster 3525 chronograph  the watch  was delivered to stalag luft iii on 10 july that year along with a note from wilsdorf apologising for any delay in processing the order and explaining that an english gentleman such as corporal nutting ""should not even think"" about paying for the watch before the end of the war. wilsdorf is reported to have been impressed with nutting because, although not an officer, he had ordered the expensive rolex 3525 oyster chronograph while most other prisoners ordered the much cheaper rolex speed king model which was popular because of its small size. the watch is believed to have been ordered specifically to be used in the great escape when, as a chronograph, it could have been used to time patrols of prison guards or time the 76 ill-fated escapees through tunnel harry on 24 march 1944. eventually, after the war, nutting was sent an invoice of only 007, while at an earlier auction in september 2006 the same watch fetched a$54,000. nutting served as a consultant for both the 1950 film the wooden horse and the 1963 film the great escape. both films were based on actual escapes which took place at stalag luft iii. it was also reported that in november 2013 the rolex speed king owned by flight lieutenant gerald imeson during the great escape was sold for 4 hours of daytona, from which the daytona model takes its name.  in 2013, rolex became the official timekeeper to the fia formula 1 motor racing championship.  rolex has also been the official timekeeper to the le mans 24 hours motor race since 2001. ex-formula 1 driver sir jackie stewart has advertised rolex since 1968. others who have done so for some years include arnold palmer, roger penske, jean claude killy, and dame kiri te kanawa. it is also the sponsor of the rolex international jumping riders club top 10 final competition.members of the hunt expedition wore rolex oysters in 1953 on mount everest but the only watch that hillary wore to the summit was a smiths ""de luxe"" rolex is currently partnered with the academy of motion picture arts & sciences as a founding supporter of the upcoming academy museum of motion pictures in los angeles, which will explore the history of film. the brand has also partnered with four oscar-winning film directors - kathryn bigelow, james cameron, alejandro g. inarritu and martin scorsese - in a campaign aimed to inspire the next generation of filmmakers to pursue their craft.mercedes gleitze was the first british woman to swim the english channel on 7 october 1927. however, as john e. brozek the rolex institute was created by the brand to help support specific people and events in line with the brands values, through two distinct programs.the first is the rolex awards for enterprise. founded in 1976 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the oyster watch, the awards recognise and support enterprising individuals from around the globe who initiate projects aimed at making the world a better place. winners receive a cash grant to advance their projects, along with international media coverage. the second is the rolex mentor and prot002 that brings together gifted young artists with globally recognised masters in the fields of architecture, dance, film, literature, music, theatre and visual arts, for a year of creative collaboration and one-to-one. rolex.org is the website for the brands philanthropic arm, whose goal is to positively impact future generations within the fields of science, the arts and the environment. the website, in complement to but entirely separate from the brands commercial site, aims to be a source of inspiration and education, presenting rolexs past and present initiatives in support of individuals and organisations from around the world. the keyword ""perpetual"" is regularly repeated throughout the website, evoking rolexs oyster perpetual watch collection while underlying the brands commitment to preserving humanitarian domains.",1,0
"mexican cuisine consists of the cooking cuisines and traditions of the modern state of mexico. its roots lie in a combination of mesoamerican and spanish cuisine. many of its ingredients and methods have their roots in the first agricultural communities such as the maya who domesticated maize, created the standard process of maize nixtamalization, and established their foodways mexican cuisine is an important aspect of the culture, social structure and popular traditions of mexico. the most important example of this connection is the use of mole for special occasions and holidays, particularly in the south and central regions of the country. for this reason and others, traditional mexican cuisine was inscribed in 2010 on the representative list of the intangible cultural heritage of humanity by unesco.mexican cuisine is a complex and ancient cuisine, with techniques and skills developed over thousands of years of history. it is created mostly with ingredients native to mexico, as well as those brought over by the spanish conquistadors, with some new influences since then. mexican cuisine has been influenced by its proximity to the us-mexican border. for example, burritos were thought to have been invented for easier transportation of beans by wrapping them in tortillas for field labor. modifications like these brought mexican cuisine to the united states, where states like arizona further adapted burritos by deep frying them, creating the modern chimichanga.in addition to staples, such as corn and chile peppers, native ingredients include tomatoes, squashes, avocados, cocoa and vanilla, as well as ingredients not generally used in other cuisines, such as edible flowers, vegetables like huauzontle and papaloquelite, or small criollo avocados, whose skin is edible. chocolate originated in mexico and was prized by the aztecs. it remains an important ingredient in mexican cookery.vegetables play an important role in mexican cuisine. common vegetables include zucchini, cauliflower, corn, potatoes, spinach, swiss chard, mushrooms, jitomate edible insects have been enjoyed in mexico for millennia. entemophagy or insect-eating is becoming increasingly popular outside of poor and rural areas for its unique flavors, sustainability, and connection to pre-hispanic heritage. popular species include chapulines despite the introduction of wheat and rice to mexico, corn is the most commonly consumed starch in almost all areas of the country and serves as the main ingredient in many local recipes  this dough is used both fresh and fermented to make a wide variety of dishes from drinks the other basic ingredient in all parts of mexico is the chile pepper. mexican food has a reputation for being very spicy, but it has a wide range of flavors and while many spices are used for cooking, not all are spicy. many dishes also have subtle flavors. chiles are indigenous to mexico and their use dates back thousands of years. they are used for their flavors and not just their heat, with mexico using the widest variety. if a savory dish or snack does not contain chile pepper, hot sauce is usually added, and chile pepper is often added to fresh fruit and sweets.the importance of the chile goes back to the mesoamerican period, where it was considered to be as much of a staple as corn and beans. in the 16th century, bartolom0th century. one example of this is the invention of the sonoran hot dog in the late 1980s. the frankfurters are usually boiled then wrapped in bacon and fried. they are served in a bolillo-style bun, typically topped by a combination of pinto beans, diced tomatoes, onions and jalape0th century, there has been an interchange of food influences between mexico and the united states. mexican cooking was of course still practiced in what is now the southwest united states after the mexican0th century. from north to south, much of the influence has been related to food industrialization, as well as the greater availability overall of food, especially after the mexican revolution. one other very visible sign of influence from the united states is the appearance of fast foods, such as hamburgers, hot dogs and pizza.in the latter 20th century, international influence in mexico has led to interest and development of haute cuisine. in mexico, many professional chefs are trained in french or international cuisine, but the use of mexican staples and flavors is still favored, including the simple foods of traditional markets. it is not unusual to see some quesadillas or small tacos among the other hors doeuvres at fancy dinner parties in mexico.professional cookery in mexico is growing and includes an emphasis on traditional methods and ingredients. in the cities, there is interest in publishing and preserving what is authentic mexican food. this movement is traceable to 1982 with the mexican culinary circle of mexico city. it was created by a group of women chefs and other culinary experts as a reaction to the fear of traditions being lost with the increasing introduction of foreign techniques and foods. in 2010, mexicos cuisine was recognized by unesco as an intangible cultural heritage of humanity.in contemporary times, various world cuisines have become popular in mexico, thus adopting a mexican fusion. for example, sushi in mexico is often made by using a variety of sauces based on mango and tamarind, and very often served with serrano-chili blended soy sauce, or complemented with vinegar, habanero peppers, and chipotle peppers.corn in mexico is not only eaten, but also drunk as a beverage. corn is the base of a hot drink called atole, which is then flavored with fruit, chocolate, rice or other flavors. fermented corn is the base of a cold drink, which goes by different names and varieties, such as tejuino, pozol and others. aguas frescas are flavored drinks usually made from fruit, water and sugar. beverages also include hibiscus iced tea, one made from tamarind and one from rice called ""horchata"". one variant of coffee is caf019, topolobampo has 1 michelin star.",1,0
"dating is a stage of romantic relationships in humans whereby two people meet socially with the aim of each assessing the others suitability as a prospective partner in an intimate relationship. it is a form of courtship, consisting of social activities done by the couple, either alone or with others. the protocols and practices of dating, and the terms used to describe it, vary considerably from country to country and over time. while the term has several meanings, the most frequent usage refers to two people exploring whether they are romantically or sexually compatible by participating in dates with the other. with the use of modern technology, people can date via telephone or computer or arrange to meet in person.dating may also involve two or more people who have already decided that they share romantic or sexual feelings toward each other. these people will have dates on a regular basis, and they may or may not be having sexual relations. this period of courtship is sometimes seen as a precursor to engagement. some cultures require people to wait until a certain age to begin dating, which has been a source of controversy.dating as an institution is a relatively recent phenomenon which has mainly emerged in the last few centuries. from the standpoint of anthropology and sociology, dating is linked with other institutions such as marriage and the family which have also been changing rapidly and which have been subject to many forces, including advances in technology and medicine. as humans societies have evolved from hunter-gatherers into civilized societies, there have been substantial changes in relations between people, with perhaps one of a few remaining biological constants being that both adult women and men must have sexual intercourse for human procreation to happen.humans have been compared to other species in terms of sexual behavior. neurobiologist robert sapolsky constructed a reproductive spectrum with opposite poles being tournament species, in which males compete fiercely for reproductive privileges with females, and pair bond arrangements, in which a male and female will bond for life. according to sapolsky, humans are somewhat in the middle of this spectrum, in the sense that humans form pair bonds, but there is the possibility of cheating or changing partners. these species-particular behavior patterns provide a context for aspects of human reproduction, including dating. however, one particularity of the human species is that pair bonds are often formed without necessarily having the intention of reproduction. in modern times, emphasis on the institution of marriage, traditionally described as a male-female bond, has obscured pair bonds formed by same-sex and transgender couples, and that many heterosexual couples also bond for life without offspring, or that often pairs that do have offspring separate. thus, the concept of marriage is changing widely in many countries.historically, marriages in most societies were arranged by parents and older relatives with the goal not being love but legacy and ""economic stability and political alliances"", according to anthropologists. accordingly, there was little need for a temporary trial period such as dating before a permanent community-recognized union was formed between a man and a woman. while pair-bonds of varying forms were recognized by most societies as acceptable social arrangements, marriage was reserved for heterosexual pairings and had a transactional nature, where wives were in many cases a form of property being exchanged between father and husband, and who would have to serve the function of reproduction. communities exerted pressure on people to form pair-bonds in places such as europe; in china, society ""demanded people get married before having a sexual relationship"" and many societies found that some formally recognized bond between a man and a woman was the best way of rearing and educating children as well as helping to avoid conflicts and misunderstandings regarding competition for mates.generally, during much of recorded history of humans in civilization, and into the middle ages in europe, weddings were seen as business arrangements between families, while romance was something that happened outside of marriage discreetly, such as covert meetings. the 12th-century book the art of courtly love advised that ""true love can have no place between husband and wife."" according to one view, clandestine meetings between men and women, generally outside of marriage or before marriage, were the precursors to todays dating.from about 1700 a worldwide movement perhaps described as the ""empowerment of the individual"" took hold, leading towards greater emancipation of women and equality of individuals. men and women became more equal politically, financially, and socially in many nations. women eventually won the right to vote in many countries and own property and receive equal treatment by the law, and these changes had profound impacts on the relationships between men and women. parental influence declined. in many societies, individuals could decide010.while the term dating has many meanings, the most common refers to a trial period in which two people explore whether to take the relationship further towards a more permanent relationship; in this sense, dating refers to the time when people are physically together in public as opposed to the earlier time period in which people are arranging the date, perhaps by corresponding by email or text or phone. another meaning of the term dating is to describe a stage in a persons life when he or she is actively pursuing romantic relationships with different people. if two unmarried celebrities are seen in public together, they are often described as ""dating"" which means they were seen in public together, and it is not clear whether they are merely friends, exploring a more intimate relationship, or are romantically involved. a related sense of the term is when two people have been out in public only a few times but have not yet committed to a relationship; in this sense, dating describes an initial trial period and can be contrasted with ""being in a committed relationship"".one of the main purposes of dating is for two or more people to evaluate one anothers suitability as a long term companion or spouse. often physical characteristics, personality, financial status, and other aspects of the involved persons are judged and, as a result, feelings can be hurt and confidence shaken. because of the uncertainty of the whole situation, the desire to be acceptable to the other person, and the possibility of rejection, dating can be very stressful for all parties involved. some studies have shown that dating tends to be extremely difficult for people with social anxiety disorder.while some of what happens on a date is guided by an understanding of basic, unspoken rules, there is considerable room to experiment, and there are numerous sources of advice available. sources of advice include magazine articles, self-help books, dating coaches, friends, and many other sources. and the advice given can pertain to all facets of dating, including such aspects as where to go, what to say, what not to say, what to wear, how to end a date, how to flirt, and differing approaches regarding first dates versus subsequent dates. in addition, advice can apply to periods before a date, such as how to meet prospective partners, as well as after a date, such as how to break off a relationship.there are now more than 500 businesses worldwide that offer dating coach services005 frequency of dating varies by person and situation; among singles actively seeking partners, 36% had been on no dates in the past three months, 13% had one date, 22% had two to four dates and 25% had five or more dates, according to a 2005 u.s. survey.the copulatory gaze, looking lengthily at a new possible partner, brings you straight into a sparring scenario; you will stare for two to three seconds when you first spy each other, then look down or away before bringing your eyes in sync again. this may be combined with displacement gestures, small repetitive fiddles that signal a desire to speed things up and make contact. when approaching a stranger you want to impress, exude confidence in your stance, even if youre on edge. pull up to your full height in a subtle chest-thrust pose, which arches your back, puffs out your upper body and pushes out your buttocks. roll your shoulders back and down and relax your facial expression.there are numerous ways to meet potential dates, including blind dates, classified ads, dating websites, hobbies, holidays, office romance, social networking, speed dating, or simply talking in public places, vehicles or houses. a pew study in 2005 which examined internet users in long-term relationships including marriage, found that many met by contacts at work or at school. the survey found that 55% of relationship-seeking singles agreed that it was ""difficult to meet people where they live.""  work is a common place to meet potential spouses, although there are some indications that the internet is overtaking the workplace as an introduction venue.  in britain, one in five marry a co-worker, but half of all workplace romances end within three months.  one drawback of office dating is that a bad date can lead to ""workplace awkwardness.""there is a general perception that men and women approach dating differently, hence the reason why advice for each sex varies greatly, particularly when dispensed by popular magazines. for example, it is a common belief that heterosexual men often seek women based on beauty and youth. psychology researchers at the university of michigan suggested that men prefer women who seem to be ""malleable and awed"", and prefer younger women with subordinate jobs such as secretaries and assistants and fact-checkers rather than executive-type women. online dating patterns suggest that men are more likely to initiate online exchanges  in a similar vein, the stereotype for heterosexual women is that they seek well-educated men who are their age or older with high-paying jobs. evolutionary psychology suggests that ""women are the choosier of the genders"" since ""reproduction is a much larger investment for women"" who have ""more to lose by making bad choices.""all of these are examples of gender stereotypes which plague dating discourse and shape individuals and societies expectations of how heterosexual relationships should be navigated. in addition to the detrimental effects of upholding limited views of relationships and sexual and romantic desires, stereotypes also lead to framing social problems in a problematic way. for example, some have noted that educated women in many countries including italy and russia, and the united states find it difficult to have a career as well as raise a family, prompting a number of writers to suggest how women should approach dating and how to time their careers and personal life. the advice comes with the assumption that the work-life balance is inherently a ""womans problem."" in many societies, there is a view that women should fulfill the role of primary caregivers, with little to no spousal support and with few services by employers or government such as parental leave or child care. accordingly, an issue regarding dating is the subject of career timing which generates controversy. some views reflect a traditional notion of gender roles. for example, danielle crittenden in what our mothers didnt tell us argued that having both a career and family at the same time was taxing and stressful for a woman; as a result, she suggested that women should date in their early twenties with a seriousness of purpose, marry when their relative beauty permitted them to find a reliable partner, have children, then return to work in their early thirties with kids in school; crittenden acknowledged that splitting a career path with a ten-year baby-raising hiatus posed difficulties. there are contrasting views which suggest that women should focus on careers in their twenties and thirties. columnist maureen dowd quoted comedian bill maher on the subject of differing dating agendas between men and women: ""women get in relationships because they want somebody to talk to -- men want women to shut up.""in studies comparing children with heterosexual families and children with homosexual families, there have been no major differences noted; though some claims suggest that kids with homosexual parents end up more well adjusted than their peers with heterosexual parents, purportedly due to the lack of marginalizing gender roles in same-sex families.it is increasingly common today, however, with new generations and in a growing number of countries, to frame the work-life balance issue as a social problem rather than a gender problem. with the advent of a changing workplace, the increased participation of women in the labor force, an increasing number of men who are picking up their share of parenting and housework, and more governments and industries committing themselves to achieving gender equality, the question of whether or not, or when to start a family is slowly being recognized as an issue that touches  and a fear of intimacy for persons of both sexes. one woman said ""being really intimate with someone in a committed sense is kind of threatening"" and described love as ""the most terrifying thing."" in her psychology today column, research scientist, columnist, and author debby herbenick compared it to a roller coaster:theres something wonderful, i think, about taking chances on love and sex. ... going out on a limb can be roller-coaster scary because none of us want to be rejected or to have our heart broken. but so what if that happens? i, for one, would rather fall flat on my face as i serenade my partner what happens in the dating world can reflect larger currents within popular culture. for example, when the 1995 book the rules appeared, it touched off media controversy about how men and women should relate to each other, with different positions taken by columnist maureen dowd of the new york times and british writer kira cochrane of the guardian and others. it has even caused anthropologists such as helen fisher to suggest that dating is a game designed to ""impress and capture"" which is not about ""honesty"" but ""novelty"", ""excitement"" and even ""danger"", which can boost dopamine levels in the brain. the subject of dating has spun off popular culture terms such as the friend zone which refers to a situation in which a dating relation evolves into a platonic non-sexual union.since people dating often do not know each other well, there is the risk of violence, including date rape. according to one report, there was a 10% chance of violence between students happening between a boyfriend and girlfriend, sometimes described as ""intimate partner violence"", over a 12004 estimate was that 20% of u.s. high school girls aged 14015 to 2018 suggest that the majority of chinese respondents  with also increasing acceptance towards evenly splitting bills or going dutch.there have been conflicting reports on expatriate dating in chinas capital city. one account in 2006 suggested the dating scene in beijing to be ""sad"" with particular difficulties for foreign women hoping to find romance. it was reportedly due to the cold, uninterested, or unappealing attitudes of the male expats and the shyness and cultural differences of the chinese men, and another account in 2010 documented similar, if slightly improved results. a different report in 2010, though, suggested that some chinese men preferred western women, viewing them as less girlish and materialistic, and also more independent and straightforward than chinese women. a 2016 survey of chinese students abroad, however, imply there have been significant barriers to foreign dating, and the intermarriage rate of chinese women in shanghai has been decreasing.a new format of internet ""qq"" chat rooms is gaining ground against so-called ""traditional dating agencies"" in changsha  internet dating, with computer-assisted matchmaking, is becoming more prevalent; one site supposedly has 23 million registered users. speed dating has come to shanghai and other cities. worldwide online matchmakers have explored entering the chinese market via partnerships or acquisitions.each year, november 11 has become an unofficial holiday known as chinas singles day when singles are encouraged to make an extra effort to find a partner. worried parents of unmarried children often arrange dates for their offspring on this day as well as others. before the day approaches, thousands of college students and young workers post messages describing their plans for this day. in arabic numerals, the day looks like ""1111"", that is, ""like four single people standing together"", and there was speculation that it originated in the late 1990s when college students celebrated being single with ""a little self-mockery"" but a differing explanation dates it back to events in the roman empire. for many, singles day offers people a way to ""demonstrate their stance on love and marriage. in 2005, a government-sponsored agency called shanghai womens activities centre there has been concern that young peoples views of marriage have changed because of economic opportunities, with many choosing deliberately not to get married, as well as young marrieds who have decided not to have children, or to postpone having them. cohabiting relationships are tolerated more often. communities where people live but do not know each other well are becoming more common in china like elsewhere, leading to fewer opportunities to meet somebody locally without assistance. divorce rates are rising in cities such as shanghai, which recorded 27,376 divorces in 2004, an increase of 30% from 2003.relationships between students preparing for college are frowned upon by many parents in china. there was a report that sexual relations among middle schoolers in guangzhou sometimes resulted in abortions. there have been reports of scams involving get-rich-quick schemes; a forty-year-old migrant worker was one of a thousand seduced by an advertisement which read ""rich woman willing to pay 3 million yuan for sperm donor"" but the worker was cheated out of his savings of 190,000 yuan the dating game show if you are the one, titled after chinese personal ads, featured some provocative contestants making sexual allusions and the show reportedly ran afoul of authorities and had to change its approach. the two-host format involves a panel of 24 single women questioning a man to decide if hell remain on the show; if he survives, he can choose a girl to date; the show gained notoriety for controversial remarks and opinions such as model ma nuo saying shed prefer to ""weep in a bmw than laugh on a bike"", who was later banned from making appearances.indian dating is heavily influenced by the custom of arranged marriages which require little dating, although there are strong indications that the institution is undergoing change, and that love marriages are becoming more accepted as india becomes more intertwined with the rest of the world. in the cities at least, it is becoming more accepted for two people to meet and try to find if there is compatibility.the majority of indian marriages are arranged by parents and relatives, and one estimate is that 7 of every 10 marriages are arranged. sometimes the bride and groom dont meet until the wedding, and there is no courtship or wooing before the joining. in the past, it meant that couples were chosen from the same caste and religion and economic status. there is widespread support for arranged marriages generally. writer lavina melwani described a happy marriage which had been arranged by the brides father, and noted that during the engagement, the woman was allowed to go out with him before they were married on only one occasion; the couple married and found happiness. supporters of arranged marriage suggest that there is a risk of having the marriage fall apart whether it was arranged by relatives or by the couple themselves, and that whats important is not how the marriage came to be but what the couple does after being married. parents and relatives exert considerable influence, sometimes posting matrimonial ads in newspapers and online. customs encourage families to put people together, and discourage sexual experimentation as well as so-called serial courtship in which a prospective bride or groom dates but continually rejects possible partners, since the interests of the family are seen as more important than the romantic needs of the people marrying. indian writers, such as mistry in his book family matters, sometimes depict arranged marriages as unhappy. writer sarita sarvate of india currents thinks people calculate their ""value"" on the ""indian marriage market"" according to measures such as family status, and that arranged marriages typically united spouses who often didnt love each other. she suggested love was out of place in this world because it risked passion and ""sordid"" sexual liaisons. love, as she sees it, is ""waking up in the morning and thinking about someone."" writer jennifer marshall described the wife in an arranged marriage as living in a world of solitude without much happiness, and feeling pressured by relatives to conceive a son so she wouldnt be considered as ""barren"" by her husbands family; in this sense, the arranged marriage didnt bring ""love, happiness, and companionship."" writer vijaysree venkatraman believes arranged marriages are unlikely to disappear soon, commenting in his book review of shoba narayans monsoon diary, which has a detailed description of the steps involved in a present-day arranged marriage. there are indications that even the institution of arranged marriages is changing, with marriages increasingly being arranged by ""unknown, unfamiliar sources"" and less based on local families who know each other. writer lavina melwani in little india compared indian marriages to business deals:until recently, indian marriages had all the trappings of a business transaction involving two deal-making families, a hardboiled matchmaker and a vocal board of shareholders 0-30 are ""emotional stability,"" ""marriage,"" ""someone to spend time with,"" etc. an interesting feature in the reasons for dating in korea is that many koreans are somewhat motivated to find a date due to the societal pressure that often views single persons as incompetent.present korean dating shows a changing attitude due to the influence of tradition and modernization. there are a lot of confucian ideas and practices that still saturate south korean culture and daily life as traditional values. patriarchy in korea has been grounded on confucian culture that postulated hierarchical social orders according to age and sex. patriarchy and women patriarchy is ""a system of social structure and practices in which men dominate, oppress and exploit women6-44, 85.7% of respondents replied as 0s to 30s. but the late trend is leaning towards the separation between dating and marriage unlike the conservative ways of the past. in the survey conducted by a marriage agency, of 300 single males and females who were asked of their opinions on marrying their lovers, about only 42% of the males and 39% of the females said yes. there are also cases of dating without the premise of marriage. however, the majority still takes getting into a relationship seriously.dating in korea is also considered a necessary activity supported by society. korean adults are constantly questioned whether or not they are dating by the people around them. during family gatherings on holidays one of the questions that people hate getting asked the most is related to marriage. according to a survey it was the highest ranked by 47.3 percent.college students in their sophomore to junior year who have not been in a relationship feel anxious that they are falling behind amongst their peers. most of them try ""sogaeting"", going out on a blind date, for the first time to get into a relationship. dating is a duty that most people feel they must take on to not seem incompetent.in recent trends, even dramas such as % of men and 71.0% of women stated that how deep their physical relation in dating is concerned in the decision of whether to marry.marriages and courtship in pakistan are influenced by traditional cultural practices similar to those elsewhere in the indian subcontinent as well as muslim norms and manners. illegitimate relationships before marriage are considered a social taboo and social interaction between unmarried men and women is encouraged at a modest and healthy level. couples are usually wedded through either an arranged marriage or love marriage. love marriages are those in which the individuals have chosen a partner whom they like by their own choice prior to marriage, and usually occur with the consent of parents and family. arranged marriages on the other hand are marriages which are set and agreed by the families or guardians of the two individuals where the couple may not have met before. in either cases and in consistency with traditional marital practices, individuals who marry are persuaded to meet and talk to each other for some time before considering marrying so that they can check their compatibility.singapores largest dating service, sdu, social development unit, is a government-run dating system. the original sdu, which controversially promoted marriages among university graduate singles, no longer exists today. on 28 january 2009, it was merged with sds , which just as controversially promoted marriages among non-graduate singles. the merged unit, sdn social development network seeks to promote meaningful relationships, with marriage touted as a top life goal, among all resident  singles within a conducive network environment of singles, relevant commercial and public entities.one report suggested that in southern taiwan, ""traditional rules of courtship"" still apply despite the influence of popular culture; for example, men continue to take the initiative in forming relationships. a poll in 2009 of students at high schools and vocational schools found that over 90% admitted that they had ""no clear idea of how to approach someone of the opposite sex who interested them"". what caused relationships to break up? 60% said ""changes of heart"" or ""cheating"". dating more than one person at a time was not permissible, agreed 70%.in britain, the term dating bears similarity to the american sense of the tentative exploratory part of a relationship. if two people are going out together, it may mean theyre dating but that their relationship has advanced to a relatively long-standing and sexual boyfriend-girlfriend relationship although theyre not cohabiting. although britons are familiar with the term dating, the rituals surrounding courtship are somewhat different from those commonly found in north america. writer kira cochrane advises daters to ""get out there and meet people"" while noting a trend of temporary suspension of marriage until an individual reaches his or her thirties. she sees a trend for developing new ways of meeting people. in contrast, writer bibi van der zee found dating etiquette rules to be helpful, and found that supposedly liberated advice such as ""just be yourself"" to be the ""most useless advice in history."" she expresses frustration following fruitless sexual relationships, and that her mid twenties saw dating relationships with partners who were less willing to return phone calls or display interest in long-term commitment. she felt ""clueless and unwanted"", she wrote, and found advice books such as the rules helpful. british writer henry castiglione signed up for a ""weekend flirting course"" and found the experience helpful; he was advised to talk to and smile at everyone he met. emailing back-and-forth, after meeting on a dating website, is one way to get to know people in britain, and elsewhere. in the uk, one estimate from 2009 is that 15 million people are single, and half of these are seeking a long-term relationship; three-quarters of them have not been in a relationship for more than 18 months. in a twelve-month period, the average number of dates that a single person will have is four. when dating, 43% of people google their dates ahead of time. almost five million britons visited a dating website in the past twelve months. a third admitting to lying on their profile. a fifth of married individuals between 19 and 25 met their spouse online. one poll in 2009 of 3,000 couples suggested that the average duration of their courtship period, between first meeting to the acceptance of a marriage proposal, was three years. in 2017 britain online dating fraud victim numbers at record high. according to the national fraud intelligence bureau, there were 3,889 victims of so-called romance fraud last year who handed over a record 016 wrote that while ""social mores had changed to accept a wider range of sexual practices"", there was still much ""loneliness and anxiety"". she traveled to san francisco and began dating a lot, using internet dating services and apps, and sometimes going to singles bars alone, only to find that the ""romantic-comedy concept of love"" with a ""perfect, permanent, tea-for-two ending"" was not going to happen to her.there is evidence that couples differ in the pace and timing with which they initiate sex in their relationships. studies show that approximately 50% of premarital young adult couples become sexually involved within the first month of dating, while 25% initiate sex one to three months after beginning to date and a small proportion of couples wait until marriage before initiating sexual relations.teenagers and college-aged students tend to avoid the more formal activity of dating, and prefer casual no-strings-attached experiments sometimes described as hookups. it permits young women to ""go out and fit into the social scene, get attention from young men, and learn about sexuality"", according to one report by sociologists. the term hookup can describe a wide variety of behavior ranging from kissing to non-genital touching; according to one report, only about one third of people had sexual intercourse. a contrary report, however, suggested there has been no ""sea change"" in sexual behavior regarding college students from 1988 onwards, and that the term hookup itself continued to be used to describe a variety of relationships, including merely socializing or passionate kissing as well as sexual intercourse.muslims living in the united states can choose whether to use traditional islamic methods, or date american-style; muslims choosing to stick to islamic tradition can ""only marry another muslim"", according to one malaysian account. mosques have been known to try to bring people together009, and the only rule is to make sure the people involved want to be set up. one matchmaker advised it was good to match ""brains as well as beauty"" and try to find people with similar religious and political viewpoints and thinks that like-minded people result in more matches, although acknowledging that opposites sometimes attract. it is easier to put several people together at the same time, so there are other candidates possible if one doesnt work out. and, after introducing people, dont meddle.friends remain a common way for people to meet. however, the internet promises to overtake friends in the future, if present trends continue. a friend can introduce two people who do not know each other, and the friend may play matchmaker and send them on a blind date. in the guardian, british writer hannah pool was cynical about being set up on a blind date; she was told ""basically hes you but in a male form"" by the mutual friend. she googled her blind dates name along with the words ""wife"" and ""girlfriend"" and ""partner"" and ""boyfriend"" to see whether her prospective date was in any kind of relationship or gay; he wasnt any of these things. she met him for coffee in london and she now lives with him, sharing a home and business. when friends introduce two people who do not know each other, it is often called a blind date.parents, via their contacts with associates or neighbors or friends, can introduce their children to each other. in india, parents often place matrimonial ads in newspapers or online, and may post the resumes of the prospective bride or groom.dating systems can be systematic and organized ways to improve matchmaking by using rules or technology. the meeting can be in-person or live as well as separated by time or space such as by telephone or email or chat-based. the purpose of the meeting is for the two persons to decide whether to go on a date in the future.the first large-scale computer dating system, the scientific marriage foundation, was established in 1957 by dr. george w. crane. in this system, forms that applicants filled out were processed by an ibm card sorting machine. the earliest commercially successfully computerized dating service in either the us or uk was com-pat, started by joan ball in 1964. operation match, started by harvard university students a year later is often erroneously claimed to be the ""first computerized dating service."" in actuality, both com-pat and operation match were preceded by other computerized dating services in europe billion per year industry, as of 2014, with an annual growth rate of 5%. the industry is dominated by a few large companies, such as eharmony, zoosk and interactivecorp, or iac, which owns several brands including match.com and okcupid, and new entrants continue to emerge. in 2019, taimi, previously targeted to gay men, was re-introduced as a dating service for all lgbtqi+ people.online dating businesses are thriving financially, with growth in members, service offerings, and membership fees and with many users renewing their accounts, although the overall share of internet traffic using online dating services in the u.s. has declined from 2003  after controversies such as the 2015 hacking of ashley madison user data, dating sites must work to convince users that theyre safe places having quality members.there is widespread evidence that online dating has increased rapidly and is becoming ""mainstream"" with new websites appearing regularly. one study suggested that 18% of single persons had used the internet for dating purposes.reports vary about the effectiveness of dating web sites to result in marriages or long005 survey of 3,215 adults, estimated that three million americans had entered into long-term relationships or marriage as a result of meeting on a dating web site. while sites have touted marriage rates from 10% to 25%, sociologists and marriage researchers are highly skeptical that valid statistics underlie any such claims.the pew study  and some concerns about stigmas. the report suggested most people had positive experiences with online dating websites and felt they were excellent ways to meet more people. the report also said that online daters tend to have more liberal social attitudes compared to the general population.in india, parents sometimes participate in websites designed to match couples. some online dating sites can organize double dates or group dates.research from berkeley suggests theres a dropoff in interest after online daters meet face005, whose object is to be ready for a date by acquiring three matching color-coded cards to assemble an outfit. the outfit must then match the outfit of the date at the ""mystery door"". if the players outfit does not match the date behind the door, the door is closed and play continues. the game has been mentioned, featured, or parodied in several popular films and television shows.numerous television reality and game shows, past and current, address dating. for example, the dating game shows the dating game first aired in 1965, while more modern shows in that genre include the manhattan dating project  a 2018 study in the journal of youth and adolescence found that serious dating among teenagers can have negative affects on a teenagers mood. this is most likely due to the incomplete cognitive and emotional development of teenagers that cause a lack of ability to handle the challenging aspects of romantic relationships.young persons are exposed to many in their high schools or secondary schools or college or universities. there is anecdotal evidence that traditional dating001 study was published, and conservative groups have promoted ""traditional"" dating. when young people are in school, they have a lot of access to people their own age, and do not need tools such as online websites or dating services. chinese writer lao wai, writing to homeland chinese about america, considered that the college years were the ""golden age of dating"" for americans, when americans dated more than at any other time in their life. there are indications people in their twenties are less focused on marriage but on careers.people over thirty, lacking the recency of a college experience, have better luck online finding partners. economist sylvia ann hewlett in 2002 found that 55% of 35-year-old career women were childless, while 19% of male corporate executives were, and concluded that ""the rule of thumb seems to be that the more successful the woman, the less likely it is she will find a husband or bear a child.""while people tend to date others close to their own age, its possible for older men to date younger women. in many countries, the older-man-younger-woman arrangement is seen as permissible, sometimes with benefits. its looked on more positively in the u.s. than in china; older men are described as more knowledgeable sexually and intellectually, supportive, skilled in the ways of women, and financially more secure so theres ""no more going dutch."" in china, older men with younger women are more likely to be described as ""weird uncles"" rather than ""silver foxes."" one beijing professor reportedly advised his male students to delay dating:research shows that successful men are, on average, older than their spouses by 12 years; exceptional men, by 17 years; and nobel laureates, well, they can be 54 years older than their mates. why date now when your ideal wives are still in kindergarten!a notable example of the older-woman-younger-man is demi moore pairing with 15-years-her-junior ashton kutcher. older women in such relations have recently been described as ""cougars"", and formerly such relationships were often kept secret or discreet, but there is a report that such relationships are becoming more accepted and increasing.since divorce is increasing in many areas, sometimes celebrated with ""divorce parties"", there is dating advice for the freshly divorced as well, which includes not talking about your ex or your divorce, but focusing on ""activities that bring joy to your life."" adviser claire rayner in the guardian suggests calling people from your address book with whom you havent been in touch for years and say ""id love to get back in contact."" do activities you like doing with like-minded people; if someone seems interesting to you, tell them. its more acceptable for this group for women to ask men out.",1,0
"tobacco is the common name of several plants in the nicotiana genus and the solanaceae  dried tobacco leaves are mainly used for smoking in cigarettes and cigars, as well as pipes and shishas. they can also be consumed as snuff, chewing tobacco, dipping tobacco and snus.tobacco use is a cause or risk factor for many diseases; especially those affecting the heart, liver, and lungs, as well as many cancers. in 2008, the world health organization named tobacco use as the worlds single greatest preventable cause of death.the english word tobacco originates from the spanish and portuguese word ""tabaco"". the precise origin of this word is disputed, but it is generally thought to have derived at least in part, from ta0th century.following the scientific revelations of the mid-20th century, tobacco was condemned as a health hazard, and eventually became recognized as a cause of cancer, as well as other respiratory and circulatory diseases. in the united states, this led to the tobacco master settlement agreement, which settled the many lawsuits by the u.s. states in exchange for a combination of yearly payments to the states and voluntary restrictions on advertising and marketing of tobacco products.in the 1970s, brown & williamson cross-bred a strain of tobacco to produce y1, a strain containing an unusually high nicotine content, nearly doubling from 3.2-3.5% to 6.5%. in the 1990s, this prompted the food and drug administration to allege that tobacco companies were intentionally manipulating the nicotine content of cigarettes.in 2003, in response to growth of tobacco use in developing countries, the world health organization successfully rallied 168 countries to sign the framework convention on tobacco control. the convention is designed to push for effective legislation and enforcement in all countries to reduce the harmful effects of tobacco. the desire of many addicted smokers to quit has led to the development of tobacco cessation products.many species of tobacco are in the genus of herbs nicotiana. it is part of the nightshade family most nightshades contain varying amounts of nicotine, a powerful neurotoxin to insects. however, tobaccos tend to contain a much higher concentration of nicotine than the others. unlike many other solanaceae species, they do not contain tropane alkaloids, which are often poisonous to humans and other animals.despite containing enough nicotine and other compounds such as germacrene and anabasine and other piperidine alkaloids  a number of such animals have evolved the ability to feed on nicotiana species without being harmed. nonetheless, tobacco is unpalatable to many species due to its other attributes. for example, although the cabbage looper is a generalist pest, tobaccos gummosis and trichomes can harm early larvae survival. as a result, some tobacco plants  in the united states, tobacco is often fertilized with the mineral apatite, which partially starves the plant of nitrogen, to produce a more desired flavor.after the plants are about 8 inches tobacco is cultivated annually, and can be harvested in several ways. in the oldest method, still used today, the entire plant is harvested at once by cutting off the stalk at the ground with a tobacco knife; it is then speared onto sticks, four to six plants a stick, and hung in a curing barn. in the 19th century, bright tobacco began to be harvested by pulling individual leaves off the stalk as they ripened. the leaves ripen from the ground upwards, so a field of tobacco harvested in this manner entails the serial harvest of a number of ""primings"", beginning with the volado leaves near the ground, working to the seco leaves in the middle of the plant, and finishing with the potent ligero leaves at the top. before harvesting, the crop must be topped when the pink flowers develop. topping always refers to the removal of the tobacco flower before the leaves are systematically harvested. as the industrial revolution took hold, the harvesting wagons which were used to transport leaves were equipped with man-powered stringers, an apparatus that used twine to attach leaves to a pole. in modern times, large fields are harvested mechanically, although topping the flower and in some cases the plucking of immature leaves is still done by hand.in the u.s., north carolina and kentucky are the leaders in tobacco production, followed by tennessee, virginia, georgia, south carolina and pennsylvania.curing and subsequent aging allow for the slow oxidation and degradation of carotenoids in tobacco leaf. this produces certain compounds in the tobacco leaves and gives a sweet hay, tea, rose oil, or fruity aromatic flavor that contributes to the ""smoothness"" of the smoke. starch is converted to sugar, which glycates protein, and is oxidized into advanced glycation endproducts  levels of ages are dependent on the curing method used.tobacco can be cured through several methods, including:some tobaccos go through a second stage of curing, known as fermenting or sweating. cavendish undergoes fermentation pressed in a casing solution containing sugar and/or flavoring.production of tobacco leaf increased by 40% between 1971, when 4.2 million tons of leaf were produced, and 1997, when 5.9 million tons of leaf were produced. according to the food and agriculture organization of the un, tobacco leaf production was expected to hit 7.1 million tons by 2010. this number is a bit lower than the record-high production of 1992, when 7.5 million tons of leaf were produced. the production growth was almost entirely due to increased productivity by developing nations, where production increased by 128%. during that same time, production in developed countries actually decreased. chinas increase in tobacco production was the single biggest factor in the increase in world production. chinas share of the world market increased from 17% in 1971 to 47% in 1997. this growth can be partially explained by the existence of a high import tariff on foreign tobacco entering china. while this tariff has been reduced from 64% in 1999 to 10% in 2004, it still has led to local, chinese cigarettes being preferred over foreign cigarettes because of their lower cost.every year, about 6.7 million tons of tobacco are produced throughout the world. the top producers of tobacco are china around the peak of global tobacco production, 20 million rural chinese households were producing tobacco on 2.1 million hectares of land. while it is the major crop for millions of chinese farmers, growing tobacco is not as profitable as cotton or sugarcane, because the chinese government sets the market price. while this price is guaranteed, it is lower than the natural market price, because of the lack of market risk. to further control tobacco in their borders, china founded a state tobacco monopoly administration  as noted above, despite the income generated for the state by profits from state-owned tobacco companies and the taxes paid by companies and retailers, chinas government has acted to reduce tobacco use.indias tobacco board is headquartered in guntur in the state of andhra pradesh. india has 96,865 registered tobacco farmers and many more who are not registered. in 2010, 3,120 tobacco product manufacturing facilities were operating in all of india. around 0.25% of indias cultivated land is used for tobacco production.since 1947, the indian government has supported growth in the tobacco industry. india has seven tobacco research centers, located in tamil nadu, andhra pradesh, punjab, bihar, mysore, and west bengal houses the core research institute.in brazil, around 135,000 family farmers cite tobacco production as their main economic activity. tobacco has never exceeded 0.7% of the countrys total cultivated area. in the southern regions of brazil, virginia, and amarelinho, flue-cured tobacco, as well as burley and galp009, reports were released by the london-based human-rights group plan international, claiming that child labor was common on malawi  tobacco farms. the organization interviewed 44 teens, who worked full-time on farms during the 2007-8 growing season. the child-laborers complained of low pay and long hours, as well as physical and sexual abuse by their supervisors. they also reported suffering from green tobacco sickness, a form of nicotine poisoning. when wet leaves are handled, nicotine from the leaves gets absorbed in the skin and causes nausea, vomiting, and dizziness. children were exposed to levels of nicotine equivalent to smoking 50 cigarettes, just through direct contact with tobacco leaves. this level of nicotine in children can permanently alter brain structure and function.major tobacco companies have encouraged global tobacco production. philip morris, british american tobacco, and japan tobacco each own or lease tobacco-manufacturing facilities in at least 50 countries and buy crude tobacco leaf from at least 12 more countries. this encouragement, along with government subsidies, has led to a glut in the tobacco market. this surplus has resulted in lower prices, which are devastating to small-scale tobacco farmers. according to the world bank, between 1985 and 2000, the inflation-adjusted price of tobacco dropped 37%. tobacco is the most widely smuggled legal product.tobacco production requires the use of large amounts of pesticides. tobacco companies recommend up to 16 separate applications of pesticides just in the period between planting the seeds in greenhouses and transplanting the young plants to the field. pesticide use has been worsened by the desire to produce larger crops in less time because of the decreasing market value of tobacco. pesticides often harm tobacco farmers because they are unaware of the health effects and the proper safety protocol for working with pesticides. these pesticides, as well as fertilizers, end up in the soil, waterways, and the food chain. coupled with child labor, pesticides pose an even greater threat. early exposure to pesticides may increase a childs lifelong cancer risk, as well as harm his or her nervous and immune systems.as with all crops, tobacco crops extract nutrients furthermore, the wood used to cure tobacco in some places leads to deforestation. while some big tobacco producers such as china and the united states have access to petroleum, coal, and natural gas, which can be used as alternatives to wood, most developing countries still rely on wood in the curing process. brazil alone uses the wood of 60 million trees per year for curing, packaging, and rolling cigarettes.in 2017 who released a study on the environmental effects of tobacco.several tobacco plants have been used as model organisms in genetics. tobacco by-2 cells, derived from n. tabacum cultivar bright yellow-2, are among the most important research tools in plant cytology. tobacco has played a pioneering role in callus culture research and the elucidation of the mechanism by which kinetin works, laying the groundwork for modern agricultural biotechnology. the first genetically modified plant was produced in 1982, using agrobacterium tumefaciens to create an antibiotic-resistant tobacco plant. this research laid the groundwork for all genetically modified crops.because of its importance as a research tool, transgenic tobacco was the first gm crop to be tested in field trials, in the united states and france in 1986; china became the first country in the world to approve commercial planting of a gm crop in 1993, which was tobacco.many varieties of transgenic tobacco have been intensively tested in field trials. agronomic traits such as resistance to pathogens currently, only the us is producing gm tobacco. the chinese virus-resistant tobacco was withdrawn from the market in china in 1997.:3 from 2002 to 2010, cigarettes made with gm tobacco with reduced nicotine content were available in the us under the market name quest.tobacco is consumed in many forms and through a number of different methods. some examples are:smoking in public was, for a long time, reserved for men, and when done by women was sometimes associated with promiscuity; in japan, during the edo period, prostitutes and their clients often approached one another under the guise of offering a smoke. the same was true in 19th-century europe.following the american civil war, the use of tobacco, primarily in cigars, became associated with masculinity and power. today, tobacco use is often stigmatized; this has spawned quitting associations and antismoking campaigns. bhutan is the only country in the world where tobacco sales are illegal. due to its propensity for causing detumescence and erectile dysfunction, some studies have described tobacco as an anaphrodisiacal substance.in christian denominations of the conservative holiness movement, such as the allegheny wesleyan methodist connection and evangelical wesleyan church, the use of tobacco and other drugs is prohibited;  of the 2014 book of discipline of the allegheny wesleyan methodist connection states:in the judgment of the allegheny wesleyan methodist connection sikhism, a monotheistic religion from india considers tobbaco consumption as a taboo and very bad for health and spirituality. initiated sikhs are never to consume tobacco in any form.research on tobacco use is limited mainly to smoking, which has been studied more extensively than any other form of consumption. an estimated 1.1019 approximately one in four youths rates of smoking continue to rise in developing countries, but have leveled off or declined in developed countries. smoking rates in the united states have dropped by half from 1965 to 2006, falling from 42% to 20.8% in adults. in the developing world, tobacco consumption is rising by 3.4% per year.tobacco smoking endangers health due to the inhalation of poisonous chemicals in tobacco smoke, such as carbon monoxide, cyanide, and carcinogens, which have been proven to cause heart and lung diseases and cancer.thousands of different substances in cigarette smoke, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons according to the world health organization  the who estimates that tobacco caused 5.4 million deaths in 2004 and 100 million deaths over the course of the 20th century. similarly, the united states centers for disease control and prevention describe tobacco use as ""the single most important preventable risk to human health in developed countries and an important cause of premature death worldwide."" due to these health consequences, it is estimated that a 10 hectare the harms caused by inhalation of tobacco smoke include diseases of the heart and lungs, with smoking being a major risk factor for heart attacks, strokes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease the addictive alkaloid nicotine is a stimulant, and popularly known as the most characteristic constituent of tobacco. in drug effect preference questionnaires, a rough indicator of addictive potential, nicotine scores almost as highly as opioids. users typically develop tolerance and dependence. nicotine is known to produce conditioned place preference, a sign of psychological enforcement value. in one medical study, tobaccos overall harm to user and self was determined at 3 percent below cocaine, and 13 percent above amphetamines, ranking 6th most harmful of the 20 drugs assessed.polonium-210 is a radioactive trace contaminant of tobacco, providing additional explanation for the link between smoking and bronchial cancer. a 1968 study found 0.33-0.36 picocurie polonium-210  a tiny fraction of the lethal dose of 1 microgram.tobacco has a significant economic impact. the global tobacco market in 2010 was estimated at us$760 billion, excluding china. statistica estimates that in the u.s. alone, the tobacco industry has a market of us$121 billion, despite the fact the cdc reports that us smoking rates are declining steadily. in the us, the decline in the number of smokers, the end of the tobacco transition payment program in 2014, and competition from growers in other countries, made tobacco farming economics more challenging.of the 1.22 billion smokers worldwide, 1 billion of them live in developing or transitional economies, and much of the disease burden and premature mortality attributable to tobacco use disproportionately affect the poor. while smoking prevalence has declined in many developed countries, it remains high in others, and is increasing among women and in developing countries. between one-fifth and two-thirds of men in most populations smoke. womens smoking rates vary more widely but rarely equal male rates.in indonesia, the lowest income group spends 15% of its total expenditures on tobacco. in egypt, more than 10% of low-income household expenditure is on tobacco. the poorest 20% of households in mexico spend 11% of their income on tobacco.the tobacco industry advertises its products through a variety of media, including sponsorship, particularly of sporting events. because of the health risks of these products, this is now one of the most highly regulated forms of marketing. some or all forms of tobacco advertising are banned in many countries.",1,0
"redneck is a derogatory term chiefly, but not exclusively, applied to white americans perceived to be crass and unsophisticated, closely associated with rural whites of the southern united states. its usage is similar in meaning to cracker  and white trash  in britain the cambridge dictionary definition states: ""a poor, white person without education, esp. one living in the countryside in the southern us, who is believed to have prejudiced ideas and beliefs. this word is usually considered offensive."" people from the white south sometimes jocularly call themselves ""rednecks"" as insider humor.by the 1970s, the term had become offensive slang, its meaning expanded to include racism, loutishness, and opposition to modern ways.patrick huber, in his monograph a short history of redneck: the fashioning of a southern white masculine identity, emphasized the theme of masculinity in the 20th-century expansion of the term, noting, ""the redneck has been stereotyped in the media and popular culture as a poor, dirty, uneducated, and racist southern white man.""the term characterized farmers having a red neck caused by sunburn from hours working in the fields. a citation from 1893 provides a definition as ""poorer inhabitants of the rural districts ... men who work in the field, as a matter of course, generally have their skin stained red and burnt by the sun, and especially is this true of the back of their necks"". hats were usually worn and they protected that wearers head from the sun, but also provided psychological protection by shading the face from close scrutiny. the back of the neck however was more exposed to the sun and allowed closer scrutiny about the persons background in the same way callused working hands could not be easily covered.by 1900, ""rednecks"" was in common use to designate the political factions inside the democratic party comprising poor white farmers in the south. the same group was also often called the ""wool hat boys"" primary on the 25th.and the ""rednecks"" will be there.and the ""yaller-heels"" will be there, also.and the ""hayseeds"" and ""gray dillers"", theyll be there, too.and the ""subordinates"" and ""subalterns"" will be there to rebuke their slanderers and traducers.and the men who pay ten, twenty, thirty, etc. etc. per cent on borrowed money will be on hand, and theyll remember it, too.by 1910, the political supporters of the mississippi democratic party politician james k. vardaman0th century was occasionally used in reference to american coal miner union members who wore red bandanas for solidarity.  the sense of ""a union man"" dates at least to the 1910s and was especially popular during the 1920s and 1930s in the coal-producing regions of west virginia, kentucky, and pennsylvania. it was also used by union strikers to describe poor white strikebreakers.writers edward abbey and dave foreman also use ""redneck"" as a political call to mobilize poor rural white southerners. ""in defense of the redneck"" was a popular essay by ed abbey. one popular early earth first! bumper sticker was ""rednecks for wilderness"". murray bookchin, an urban leftist and social ecologist, objected strongly to earth first!s use of the term as ""at the very least, insensitive"". however, many southerners have proudly embraced the term as a self-identifier. similarly to earth first!s use, the self-described ""anti-racist, pro-gun, pro-labor"" group redneck revolt have used the term to signal its roots in the rural white working-class and celebration of what member max neely described as ""redneck culture"".according to chapman and kipfer in their ""dictionary of american slang"", by 1975 the term had expanded in meaning beyond the poor southerner to refer to ""a bigoted and conventional person, a loutish ultra-conservative"". for example, in 1960 john bartlow martin expressed senator john f. kennedy should not enter the indiana democratic presidential primary because the state was ""redneck conservative country"".  indiana, he told kennedy, was a state ""suspicious of foreign entanglements, conservative in fiscal policy, and with a strong overlay of southern segregationist sentiment"".  writer william safire observes it is often used to attack white southern conservatives, and more broadly to degrade working class and rural whites that are perceived by urban progressives to be insufficiently progressive. at the same time, some white southerners have reclaimed the word, using it with pride and defiance as a self-identifier.in scotland in the 1640s, the covenanters rejected rule by bishops, often signing manifestos using their own blood. some wore red cloth around their neck to signify their position, and were called rednecks by the scottish ruling class to denote that they were the rebels in what came to be known as the bishops war that preceded the rise of cromwell. eventually, the term began to mean simply ""presbyterian"", especially in communities along the scottish border. because of the large number of scottish immigrants in the pre-revolutionary american south, some historians have suggested that this may be the origin of the term in the united states.dictionaries document the earliest american citation of the terms use for presbyterians in 1830, as ""a name bestowed upon the presbyterians of fayetteville "".in northern england during the 19th and 20th centuries, roman catholics were known as rednecks.the exact afrikaans equivalent, rooinek, is used as a disparaging term for english people and south africans of english descent, in reference to their supposed na\xc3\xafvet\xc3\xa9 as later arrivals in the region in failing to protect themselves from the sun.",1,0
"the amazon rainforest, alternatively, the amazon jungle, also known in english as amazonia, is a moist broadleaf tropical rainforest in the amazon biome that covers most of the amazon basin of south america. this basin encompasses 7,000,000  and comprises the largest and most biodiverse tract of tropical rainforest in the world, with an estimated 390 billion individual trees divided into 16,000 species.more than 30 million people of 350 different ethnic groups live in the amazon, which are subdivided into 9 different national political systems. indigenous peoples make up 9% of the total population with 60 of the groups remaining largely isolated.the name amazon is said to arise from a war francisco de orellana fought with the tapuyas and other tribes. the women of the tribe fought alongside the men, as was their custom. orellana derived the name amazonas from the amazons of greek mythology, described by herodotus and diodorus.tribal societies are well capable of escalation to all-out wars between tribes. thus, in the amazonas, there was perpetual animosity between the neighboring tribes of the jivaro. several tribes of the jivaroan group, including the shuar, practised headhunting for trophies and headshrinking. the accounts of missionaries to the area in the borderlands between brazil and venezuela have recounted constant infighting in the yanomami tribes. more than a third of the yanomamo males, on average, died from warfare.during the amazon rubber boom it is estimated that diseases brought by immigrants, such as typhus and malaria, killed 40,000 native amazonians.nine countries share the amazon basin.8%, bolivia with 7.7%, colombia with 7.1%, venezuela with 6.1%, guyana with 3.1%, suriname with 2.5%, french guyana with 1.4%, and ecuador with 1%.the rainforest likely formed during the eocene era following the cretaceous1,000 years through the last glacial maximum  there is a debate, however, over how extensive this reduction was. some scientists argue that the rainforest was reduced to small, isolated refugia separated by open forest and grassland; other scientists argue that the rainforest remained largely intact but extended less far to the north, south, and east than is seen today. this debate has proved difficult to resolve because the practical limitations of working in the rainforest mean that data sampling is biased away from the center of the amazon basin, and both explanations are reasonably well supported by the available data.more than 56% of the dust fertilizing the amazon rainforest comes from the bod million tons of dust are windblown out of the sahara each year, at 15 degrees west longitude, across 2,600007 and the lowest in 2011.a possibility causing the variation is the sahel, a strip of semi-arid land on the southern border of the sahara. when rain amounts in the sahel are higher, the volume of dust is lower. the higher rainfall could make more vegetation grow in the sahel, leaving less sand exposed to winds to blow away.amazon phosphorus also comes as smoke due to biomass burning in africa.based on archaeological evidence from an excavation at caverna da pedra pintada, human inhabitants first settled in the amazon region at least 11,200 years ago. subsequent development led to late-prehistoric settlements along the periphery of the forest by ad 1250, which induced alterations in the forest cover.for a long time, it was thought that the amazon rainforest was never more than sparsely populated, as it was impossible to sustain a large population through agriculture given the poor soil. archeologist betty meggers was a prominent proponent of this idea, as described in her book amazonia: man and culture in a counterfeit paradise. she claimed that a population density of 0.2 inhabitants per square kilometre  however, recent anthropological findings have suggested that the region was actually densely populated. some 5 million people may have lived in the amazon region in ad 1500, divided between dense coastal settlements, such as that at maraj00,000.the first european to travel the length of the amazon river was francisco de orellana in 1542. the bbcs unnatural histories presents evidence that orellana, rather than exaggerating his claims as previously thought, was correct in his observations that a complex civilization was flourishing along the amazon in the 1540s. it is believed that civilization was later devastated by the spread of diseases from europe, such as smallpox. this civilization was investigated by the british explorer percy fawcett in the early twentieth century.  the results of his expeditions were inconclusive and he disappeared mysteriously on his last trip.  his name for this lost civilization was the city of z.since the 1970s, numerous geoglyphs have been discovered on deforested land dating between ad 150, furthering claims about pre-columbian civilizations. ondemar dias is accredited with first discovering the geoglyphs in 1977, and alceu ranzi is credited with furthering their discovery after flying over acre. the bbcs unnatural histories presented evidence that the amazon rainforest, rather than being a pristine wilderness, has been shaped by man for at least 11,000 years through practices such as forest gardening and terra preta. terra preta is found over large areas in the amazon forest; and is now widely accepted as a product of indigenous soil management. the development of this fertile soil allowed agriculture and silviculture in the previously hostile environment; meaning that large portions of the amazon rainforest are probably the result of centuries of human management, rather than naturally occurring as has previously been supposed. in the region of the xingu tribe, remains of some of these large settlements in the middle of the amazon forest were found in 2003 by michael heckenberger and colleagues of the university of florida. among those were evidence of roads, bridges and large plazas.wet tropical forests are the most species-rich biome, and tropical forests in the americas are consistently more species rich than the wet forests in africa and asia. as the largest tract of tropical rainforest in the americas, the amazonian rainforests have unparalleled biodiversity. one in ten known species in the world lives in the amazon rainforest. this constitutes the largest collection of living plants and animal species in the world.the region is home to about 2.5 million insect species, tens of thousands of plants, and some 2,000 birds and mammals. to date, at least 40,000 plant species, 2,200 fishes, 1,294 birds, 427 mammals, 428 amphibians, and 378 reptiles have been scientifically classified in the region. one in five of all bird species are found in the amazon rainforest, and one in five of the fish species live in amazonian rivers and streams. scientists have described between 96,660 and 128,843 invertebrate species in brazil alone.the biodiversity of plant species is the highest on earth with one 2001 study finding a quarter square kilometer  a study in 1999 found one square kilometer  to date, an estimated 438,000 species of plants of economic and social interest have been registered in the region with many more remaining to be discovered or catalogued. the total number of tree species in the region is estimated at 16,000.the green leaf area of plants and trees in the rainforest varies by about 25% as a result of seasonal changes. leaves expand during the dry season when sunlight is at a maximum, then undergo abscission in the cloudy wet season. these changes provide a balance of carbon between photosynthesis and respiration.the rainforest contains several species that can pose a hazard. among the largest predatory creatures are the black caiman, jaguar, cougar, and anaconda. in the river, electric eels can produce an electric shock that can stun or kill, while piranha are known to bite and injure humans. various species of poison dart frogs secrete lipophilic alkaloid toxins through their flesh. there are also numerous parasites and disease vectors. vampire bats dwell in the rainforest and can spread the rabies virus. malaria, yellow fever and dengue fever can also be contracted in the amazon region.hoatzinmygalomorphaehowler monkeyheliconiabrown-throated slothemperor tamarinblue poison dart frogsouth american

sources of deforestation in the amazon are human settlement and development of the land. in 2018, about 17% of the amazon rainforest was already destroyed. research suggests that upon reaching about 205% prior to the early 1960s, access to the forests interior was highly restricted, and the forest remained basically intact. farms established during the 1960s were based on crop cultivation and the slash and burn method. however, the colonists were unable to manage their fields and the crops because of the loss of soil fertility and weed invasion. the soils in the amazon are productive for just a short period of time, so farmers are constantly moving to new areas and clearing more land. these farming practices led to deforestation and caused extensive environmental damage. deforestation is considerable, and areas cleared of forest are visible to the naked eye from outer space.in the 1970s, construction began on the trans-amazonian highway. this highway represented a major threat to the amazon rainforest. the highway still has not been completed, limiting the environmental damage.between 1991 and 2000, the total area of forest lost in the amazon rose from 415,000 to 587,000  seventy percent of formerly forested land in the amazon, and 91% of land deforested since 1970, have been used for livestock pasture. currently, brazil is the second-largest global producer of soybeans after the united states. new research however, conducted by leydimere oliveira et al., has shown that the more rainforest is logged in the amazon, the less precipitation reaches the area and so the lower the yield per hectare becomes. so despite the popular perception, there has been no economical advantage for brazil from logging rainforest zones and converting these to pastoral fields.the needs of soy farmers have been used to justify many of the controversial transportation projects that are currently developing in the amazon. the first two highways successfully opened up the rainforest and led to increased settlement and deforestation. the mean annual deforestation rate from 2000 to 2005  although deforestation declined significantly in the brazilian amazon between 2004 and 2014, there has been an increase to the present day.since the discovery of fossil fuel reservoirs in the amazon rainforest, oil drilling activity has steadily increased, peaking in the western amazon in the 1970s and ushering another drilling boom in the 2000s. as oil companies have to set up their operations by opening roads through forests, which often contributes to deforestation in the region.the european union,843 fires in brazil in 2019, with more than half within the amazon region.  in august 2019 there were a record number of fires. deforestation in the brazilian amazon rose more than 88% in june 2019 compared with the same month in 2018.nasa satellite observation of deforestation in the mato grosso state of brazil. the transformation from forest to farm is evident by the paler square shaped areas under development.fires and deforestation in the state of rond 100. however, simulations of amazon basin climate change across many different models are not consistent in their estimation of any rainfall response, ranging from weak increases to strong decreases. the result indicates that the rainforest could be threatened though the 21st century by climate change in addition to deforestation.in 1989, environmentalist c.m. peters and two colleagues stated there is economic as well as biological incentive to protecting the rainforest. one hectare in the peruvian amazon has been calculated to have a value of $6820 if intact forest is sustainably harvested for fruits, latex, and timber; $1000 if clear-cut for commercial timber as indigenous territories continue to be destroyed by deforestation and ecocide, such as in the peruvian amazon indigenous peoples rainforest communities continue to disappear, while others, like the urarina continue to struggle to fight for their cultural survival and the fate of their forested territories. meanwhile, the relationship between non-human primates in the subsistence and symbolism of indigenous lowland south american peoples has gained increased attention, as have ethno-biology and community-based conservation efforts.from 2002 to 2006, the conserved land in the amazon rainforest almost tripled and deforestation rates dropped up to 60%. about 1,000,000 in april 2019, the ecuadorian court stopped oil exploration activities in 180,000 hectares in july 2019, the ecuadorian court forbade the government to sell territory with forests to oil companies. in september 2019, the us and brazil agreed to promote private-sector development in the amazon. they also pledged a $100m  biodiversity conservation fund for the amazon led by the private sector. brazils foreign minister stated that opening the rain-forest to economic development was the only way to protect it.anthropogenic emission of greenhouse gases broken down by sector for the year 2000.aerosols over the amazon each september for four burning seasons a new study by an international team of environmental scientists in the brazilian amazon shows that protection of freshwater biodiversity can be increased by up to 600% through integrated freshwater-terrestrial planning .deforestation in the amazon rainforest region has a negative impact on local climate. it was one of the main causes of the severe drought  of 2014015 in brazil. this is because the moisture from the forests is important to the rainfall in brazil, paraguay and argentina. half of the rainfall in the amazon area is produced by the forests.the use of remotely sensed data is dramatically improving conservationists knowledge of the amazon basin. given the objectivity and lowered costs of satellite-based land cover analysis, it appears likely that remote sensing technology will be an integral part of assessing the extent and damage of deforestation in the basin. furthermore, remote sensing is the best and perhaps only possible way to study the amazon on a large scale.the use of remote sensing for the conservation of the amazon is also being used by the indigenous tribes of the basin to protect their tribal lands from commercial interests. using handheld gps devices and programs like google earth, members of the trio tribe, who live in the rainforests of southern suriname, map out their ancestral lands to help strengthen their territorial claims. currently, most tribes in the amazon do not have clearly defined boundaries, making it easier for commercial ventures to target their territories.to accurately map the amazons biomass and subsequent carbon related emissions, the classification of tree growth stages within different parts of the forest is crucial. in 2006, tatiana kuplich organized the trees of the amazon into four categories: mature forest, regenerating forest , regenerating forest , and regenerating forest . the researcher used a combination of synthetic aperture radar  and there were indications that 2006 may have been a second successive year of drought. a 2006 article in the uk newspaper the independent reported the woods hole research center results, showing that the forest in its present form could survive only three years of drought. scientists at the brazilian national institute of amazonian research argued in the article that this drought response, coupled with the effects of deforestation on regional climate, are pushing the rainforest towards a ""tipping point"" where it would irreversibly start to die. it concluded that the forest is on the brink of being turned into savanna or desert, with catastrophic consequences for the worlds climate. a study published in nature communications in october 2020 found that about 40% of the amazon rainforest is at risk of becoming a savanna-like ecosystem due to reduced rainfall.according to the world wide fund for nature, the combination of climate change and deforestation increases the drying effect of dead trees that fuels forest fires.in 2010, the amazon rainforest experienced another severe drought, in some ways more extreme than the 2005 drought. the affected region was approximately 3,000,000  additional severe droughts occurred in 2010, 2015, and 2016.in 2019 brazils protections of the amazon rainforest were slashed, resulting in a severe loss of trees. according to brazils national institute for space research in 2020, a 17 per cent rise was noted in the amazon wildfires, marking the worst start to the

"beirut  arabic: 014, greater beirut has a population of 2.2, beirut began its revival.by the second half of the nineteenth century, beirut was developing close commercial and political ties with european imperial powers, particularly france. european interests in lebanese silk and other export products transformed the city into a major port and commercial centre. this boom in cross-regional trade allowed certain groups, such as the sursock family, to establish trade and manufacturing empires that further strengthened beiruts position as a key partner in the interests of imperial dynasties. meanwhile, ottoman power in the region continued to decline. sectarian and religious conflicts, power vacuums, and changes in the political dynamics of the region culminated in the 1860 lebanon conflict. beirut became a destination for maronite christian refugees fleeing from the worst areas of the fighting on mount lebanon and in damascus. this in turn altered the religious composition of beirut itself, sowing the seeds of future sectarian and religious troubles there and in greater lebanon. however, beirut was able to prosper in the meantime. this was again a product of european intervention, and also a general realisation amongst the citys residents that commerce, trade, and prosperity depended on domestic stability. after petitions by the local bourgeois, the governor of syria vilayet mehmed rashid pasha authorized the establishment of the beirut municipal council, the first municipality established in the arab provinces of the empire. the council was elected by an assembly of city notables and played an instrumental role governing the city through the following decades.in 1888, beirut was made capital of a vilayet  including the sanjaks  by this time, beirut had grown into a cosmopolitan city and had close links with europe and the united states. it also became a centre of missionary activity that spawned educational institutions, such as the american university of beirut. provided with water from a british company and gas from a french one, silk exports to europe came to dominate the local economy. after french engineers established a modern harbour in 1894 and a rail link across lebanon to damascus and aleppo in 1907, much of the trade was carried by french ships to marseille. french influence in the area soon exceeded that of any other european power. the 1911 encyclop,500 jews, 400 druze and 4,100 foreigners. at the start of the 20th century, salim ali salam was one of the most prominent figures in beirut, holding numerous public positions including deputy from beirut to the ottoman parliament and president of the municipality of beirut. given his modern way of life, the emergence of salim ali salam as a public figure constituted a transformation in terms of the social development of the city.in his 2003 book entitled beirut and its seven families, dr. yussef bin ahmad bin ali al husseini says:the seven families of beirut are the families who bonded among each other and made the famous historical agreement with the governor of the syrian coast in 1351 to protect and defend the city of beirut and its shores, and chase the invaders and stop their progress towards it.after world war i and the collapse of the ottoman empire, beirut, along with the rest of lebanon, was placed under the french mandate. lebanon achieved independence in 1943, and beirut became the capital city. the city remained a regional intellectual capital, becoming a major tourist destination and a banking haven, especially for the persian gulf oil boom.this era of relative prosperity ended in 1975 when the lebanese civil war broke out throughout the country, during most of the war, beirut was divided between the muslim west part and the christian east. the downtown area, previously the home of much of the citys commercial and cultural activity, became a no mans land known as the green line. many inhabitants fled to other countries. about 60,000 people died in the first two years of the war  but christian militias defeated multiple attempts by syrias elite forces to capture the strategic area in a three-month campaign later known as the hundred days war.another destructive chapter was the 1982 lebanon war, during which most of west beirut was under siege by israeli troops. in 1983, french and us barracks were bombed, killing 241 american servicemen, 58 french servicemen, six civilians and the two suicide bombers.since the end of the war in 1990, the people of lebanon have been rebuilding beirut, whose urban agglomeration was mainly constituted during war time through an anarchic urban development stretching along the littoral corridor and its nearby heights. by the start of the 2006 israel-lebanon conflict the city had somewhat regained its status as a tourist, cultural and intellectual centre in the middle east and as a centre for commerce, fashion, and media. the reconstruction of downtown beirut has been largely driven by solidere, a development company established in 1994 by prime minister rafic hariri. the city has hosted both the asian club basketball championship and the asian football cup, and has hosted the miss europe pageant nine times: 1960001002, and 2016.rafic hariri was assassinated in 2005 near the saint george hotel in beirut. a month later about one million people gathered for an opposition rally in beirut. the cedar revolution was the largest rally in lebanons history at that time. the last syrian troops withdrew from beirut on 26 april 2005, and the two countries established diplomatic relations on 15 october 2008.during the 2006 lebanon war, israeli bombardment caused damage in many parts of beirut, especially the predominantly shiite southern suburbs of beirut. on 12 july 2006, the ""operation truthful promise"" carried out by hezbollah ended with 8 israeli deaths and 6 injuries. in response, the idf targeted hezbollahs main media outlets. there were then artillery raids against targets in southern lebanon, and the israeli cabinet held beirut responsible for the attacks. then on 13 july 2006 israel began implementing a naval and air blockade over lebanon; during this blockade israel bombed the runways at beirut international airport and the major beirut-damascus highway in eastern lebanon.in may 2008, after the government decided to disband hezbollahs communications network  after this a national dialogue conference was held in doha at the invitation of the prince of qatar. the conference agreed to appoint a new president of lebanon and to establish a new national government involving all the political adversaries. as a result of the doha agreement, the oppositions barricades were dismantled and so were the oppositions protest camps in martyrs square. on 19 october 2012, a car bomb killed eight people in the beiruts neighbourhood of achrafiyeh, including brigadier general wissam al-hassan, chief of the intelligence bureau of the internal security forces. in addition, 78 others were wounded in the bombing. it was the largest attack in the capital since 2008. on 27 december 2013, a car bomb exploded in the central district killing at least five people, including the former lebanese ambassador to the u.s. mohamad chatah, and wounding 71 others.in the 12 november 2015 beirut bombings, two suicide bombers detonated explosives outside a mosque and inside a bakery, killing 43 people and injuring 200. the islamic state of iraq and the levant immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks.on 4 august 2020, a massive explosion in the port of beirut resulted in the death of at least 203 people  and the wounding of more than 6,500. foreigners from at least 22 countries were among the casualties. furthermore, at least 108 bangladeshis were injured in the blasts, making them the most affected foreign community. the cause of the blast is believed to be from government-confiscated and stored ammonium nitrate. as many as 300,000 people have been left homeless by the explosion. protesters in lebanon called on the government on 8 august 2020 for the end of the alleged negligence that resulted in the 4 august explosion. on 10 august 2020, as a result of the protests, prime minister hassan diab announced his resignation. weeks later, a huge fire erupted in an oil and tyre warehouse in the ports duty-free zone, on 10 september 2020.beirut sits on a peninsula extending westward into the mediterranean sea. it is flanked by the lebanon mountains and has taken on a triangular shape, largely influenced by its situation between and atop two hills: al-ashrafieh and al-musaytibah. the beirut governorate occupies 18 square kilometres  the coast is rather diverse, with rocky beaches, sandy shores and cliffs situated beside one another.beirut has a hot-summer mediterranean climate beirut is divided into 12 quarters these quarters are divided into 59 sectors badaro is an edgy, bohemian style neighbourhood, within the green district of beirut two of the twelve official palestinian refugee camps in lebanon are located in the southern suburbs of beirut: bourj el-barajneh and shatila. there is also one within its municipal boundaries: mar elias. of the 15 unregistered or unofficial refugee camps, sabra, which lies adjacent to shatila, is also located in southern beirut and was the scene of a massacre during the civil warpeople in lebanon often use different names for the same geographic locations, and few people rely on official, government-provided street numbers. instead, historic and commercial landmarks are more common.no population census has been taken in lebanon since 1932, but estimates of beiruts population range from as low as 938,940 through 1,303,129 to as high as 2,200,000 as part of greater beirut.beirut is one of the most cosmopolitan and religiously diverse cities of lebanon and all of the middle east. the city boasts significant muslim and christian communities. in beirut there are 18 recognised religious groups. at the end of the civil war the copts became another recognised confession, bringing the total number to eighteen. the original seventeen included three muslim sects: shia, sunni, and alawi; one druze sect; twelve christian sects: maronite catholics, greek orthodox, melkite catholics, protestant evangelicals, and other christian denominations non-native to lebanon like armenian orthodox, armenian catholics, assyrians  briefly, christians are 42% of beirut, muslims 52%, 5% druze,1% others.church of saint george

mainly christian population with a small muslim minority, while west beirut has a sunni muslim majority with small minorities of shia, christians and druze. since the end of the civil war, east and west beirut have begun to see an increase in muslims and christians moving into each half. the southern suburbs are populated largely by shia muslims, while the eastern and northern suburbs are largely christian.the city is also home to a small number of latin rite roman catholics in the form of an apostolic vicariate with archbishop paul dahdah, ocd, as the apostolic vicar.the beirut central district  it is an area thousands of years old, traditionally a focus of business, finance, culture and leisure. its reconstruction constitutes one of the most ambitious contemporary urban developments. due to the devastation incurred on the city centre from the lebanese civil war, the beirut central district underwent a thorough reconstruction and development plan that gave it back its cultural and economic position in the region. ever since, beirut central district has evolved into an integrated business and commercial environment and the focus of the financial activity in the region. that evolution was accompanied with the relocation of international organisations, reoccupation of civic and government buildings, expansion of financial activities, and establishment of regional headquarters and global firms in the city centre.assessment of the demand for build-up space in the bcd has been done in reference to a number of macro-economic, demographic, and urban planning considerations at a time of marked need for new activity poles in the city, such as souks, financial, cultural and recreational centres. the districts total area is 4,690,000 square metres  the beirut central district contains over 60 gardens, squares and open spaces. these spaces comprise landscaped streets, gardens, historical squares, pedestrian areas and sea promenades thus totalling to an area of 96 acres  solidere, the company responsible for the reconstruction and renovation of the district, organises music and entertainment events all throughout the year like the beirut marathon, f. much of the damage had been done through unapproved demolitions in the 1980s and early 1990s, bringing down  ""some of the capitals most significant buildings and structures,"" wrote ucla professor saree makdisi in the journal, critical inquiry, in 1997."". moreover, many of the traditional privately owned shops in the beirut downtown were replaced by luxury outlets and high-end restaurants that only few people could afford. and most of public spaces promised by solidere since the start of the reconstruction, such as ""the garden of forgiveness"", a central park, and an archaeological museum, remain unfinished until today, putting into question the actual benefit of the project to the population.finally, the actual success of the project has recently been in doubt, given that large quarters of the bcd are today empty, due to strong military presence, the nejmeh square where the parliament is located is most frequently completely deserted, and the business located there have mostly moved.beiruts economy is service-oriented with the main growth sectors being banking and tourism.in an area dominated by authoritarian or militarist regimes, the lebanese capital was generally regarded as a haven of libertarianism, though a precarious one. with its seaport and airport012, nearing 3.5 times the gdp estimated at $43012 by 8% to 125 percent of the sectors

""banks are still attracting deposits because the interest rates offered are higher than the ones in europe and the united states"", says marwan mikhael, head of research at blom bank.beiruts foreign reserves were still close to an all-time high when they reached $32.5011 and analysts say that the central bank can cover nearly 80 percent of the lebanese currency in the market. this means that the central bank can easily cope with any unforeseen crisis in the future thanks to the massive foreign currency reserves.the lebanese banking system is endowed with several characteristics that promote the role of beirut as a regional financial centre, in terms of ensuring protection for foreign capital and earnings. the lebanese currency is fully convertible and can be exchanged freely with any other currency. moreover, no restrictions are put on the free flow of capital and earnings into and out of the lebanese economy. the passing of the banking secrecy law on 3 september 1956, subjected all banks established in lebanon as well as foreign banks branches to the ""secret of the profession"". both article 16 of law no. 282 dated 30 december 1993 and article 12 of decree no. 5451 dated 26 august 1994, offer exemptions from income tax on all interest and revenues earned on all types of accounts opened in lebanese banks. on the first of april 1975, decree no. 29 established a free banking zone by granting the lebanese government the right to exempt non-residents deposits and liabilities in foreign currency from: the income tax on interest earned, the required reserves imposed by the banque du liban by virtue of article 76 of the code of money and credit, the premium of deposit guarantee imposed on bank deposits to the profit of the national deposit guarantee institution.the tourism industry in beirut has been historically important to the local economy and remains to this day to be a major source of revenue for the city, and lebanon in general. before the lebanese civil war, beirut was widely regarded as the ""paris of the middle east,"" often cited as a financial and business hub where visitors could experience the levantine mediterranean culture. beiruts diverse atmosphere and ancient history make it an important destination which is slowly rebuilding itself after continued turmoil. however, in recent times, certain countries, such as the united states, have frequently placed lebanon, and beirut in particular, on their travel warnings lists due to the many car bombings and orchestrated acts of political violence.according to the 2012 tourist statistics, 34% of the tourists in beirut came from states within the arab league, 33% came from european countries the largely pedestrianised beirut central district is the core of the beirut tourism scene. the district is a cluster of stone-fa006, it was ranked 9th best city in the world. that list was voted upon shortly before the 2006 lebanon war broke out, but in 2008 the guardian listed beirut as one of its top ten cities in the world. the new york times ranked it at number one on its ""44 places to go"" list of 2009. 2011 mastercard index revealed that beirut had the second-highest visitor spending levels in the middle east and africa, totalling $6.5012 by cond010;

applied pressure increases the volume.the keyboard touch is not expressive and does not affect dynamics: all expression is effected through the bellows. bellows effects include:the accordions body consists of two wooden boxes joined together by the bellows. these boxes house reed chambers for the right- and left-hand manuals. each side has grilles in order to facilitate the transmission of air in and out of the instrument, and to allow the sound to project better. the grille for the right-hand manual is usually larger and is often shaped for decorative purposes. the right-hand manual is normally used for playing the melody and the left-hand manual for playing the accompaniment; however, skilled players can reverse these roles and play melodies with the left hand.the size and weight of an accordion varies depending on its type, layout and playing range, which can be as small as to have only one or two rows of basses and a single octave on the right-hand manual, to the standard 120-bass accordion and through to large and heavy 160-bass free-bass converter models.the accordion is an aerophone. the manual mechanism of the instrument either enables the air flow, or disables it:the term accordion covers a wide range of instruments, with varying components. all instruments have reed ranks of some format, apart from reedless digital accordions. not all have switches to change registers or ranks, as some have only one treble register and one bass register. the most typical accordion is the piano accordion, which is used for many musical genres. another type of accordion is the button accordion, which is used in musical traditions including cajun, conjunto and tejano music, swiss and slovenian-austro-german alpine music, and argentinian tango music. the helikon-style accordion has multiple flared horns projecting out of the left side to strengthen the bass tone. the word ""helikon"" refers to a deep-pitched tuba.different systems exist for the right-hand manual of an accordion, which is normally used for playing the melody  by those who prefer it. they are also used to define one accordion or another as a different ""type"":a button key

harmonikawerkedifferent systems are also in use for the left-hand manual, which is normally used for playing the accompaniment. these almost always use distinct bass buttons and often have buttons with concavities or studs to help the player navigate the layout despite not being able to see the buttons while playing. there are three general categories:inside the accordion are the reeds that generate the instrument tones. these are organized in different sounding banks, which can be further combined into registers producing differing timbres. all but the smaller accordions are equipped with switches that control which combination of reed banks operate, organized from high to low registers. each register stop produces a separate sound timbre, many of which also differ in octaves or in how different octaves are combined. see the accordion reed ranks and switches article for further explanation and audio samples. all but the smallest accordions usually have treble switches. the larger and more expensive accordions often also have bass switches to give options for the reed bank on the bass side.in describing or pricing an accordion, the first factor is size, expressed in number of keys on either side. for a piano type, this could for one example be 37/96, meaning 37 treble keys  although one instrument has been recently discovered that appears to have been built earlier.the earliest history of the accordion in russia is poorly documented. nevertheless, according to russian researchers, the earliest known simple accordions were made in tula, russia, by ivan sizov and timofey vorontsov around 1830, after they received an early accordion from germany. by the late 1840s, the instrument was already very widespread; together the factories of the two masters were producing 10,000 instruments a year. by 1866, over 50,000 instruments were being produced yearly by tula and neighbouring villages, and by 1874 the yearly production was over 700,000. by the 1860s, novgorod, vyatka and saratov governorates also had significant accordion production. by the 1880s, the list included oryol, ryazan, moscow, tver, vologda, kostroma, nizhny novgorod and simbirsk, and many of these places created their own varieties of the instrument.the accordion is one of several european inventions of the early 19th century that use free reeds driven by a bellows. an instrument called accordion was first patented in 1829 by cyrill demian, of armenian origin, in vienna. demians instrument bore little resemblance to modern instruments. it only had a left hand buttonboard, with the right hand simply operating the bellows. one key feature for which demian sought the patent was the sounding of an entire chord by depressing one key. his instrument also could sound two different chords with the same key, one for each bellows direction the accordion was introduced from germany into britain in about the year 1828. the instrument was noted in the times in 1831 as one new to british audiences and was not favourably reviewed, but nevertheless it soon became popular. it had also become popular with new yorkers by the mid-1840s.after demians invention, other accordions appeared, some featuring only the right-handed keyboard for playing melodies. it took english inventor charles wheatstone to bring both chords and keyboard together in one squeezebox. his 1844 patent for what he called a concertina also featured the ability to easily tune the reeds from the outside with a simple tool.the musician adolph m2, the austrian alban berg included an accordion in wozzeck, op. 7. in 1937 the first accordion concerto was composed in russia. other notable composers have written for the accordion during the first half of the 20th century. included among this group was the italian-american john serry sr., whose concerto for free bass accordion was completed in 1964. in addition, the american accordionist robert davine composed his divertimento for flute, clarinet, bassoon and accordion as a work for chamber orchestra. american composer william p. perry featured the accordion in his orchestral suite six title themes in search of a movie  accordionists like mogens ellegaard, joseph macerollo, friedrich lips, hugo noth, stefan hussong, italo salizzato, teodoro anzellotti, mie miki, and geir draugsvoll, encouraged composers to write new music for the accordion the accordion initially competed against cheaper and more convenient reed instruments such as mouth organ, concertina and melodeon.frank fracchia was an australian accordion composer and copies of his works ""my dear, can you come out tonight"" and ""dancing with you"" are preserved in australian libraries.other australian composers who arranged music for accordion include reginald stoneham.the popularity of the accordion peaked in the late 1930s and continued until the 1950s.the accordion was particularly favoured by buskers.the accordion is a traditional

instrument of the rio grande do sul state, where was voted by unanimity in the deputy chamber.during the boom of accordions there were around 65 factories in brazil, where most of them  the most notable musicians of button accordions are renato borghetti, adelar bertussi, albino manique and edson dutra.compared to many other countries, the instrument is very popular in mainstream pop music. in some parts of the country, such as the northeast it is the most popular melodic instrument. as opposed to most european folk accordions, a very dry tuning is usually used in brazil. outside the south, the accordion every year in april, colombia holds one of the most important musical festivals in the country: the vallenato legend festival. the festival holds contests for best accordion player. once every decade, the ""king of kings"" accordion competition takes place, where winners of the previous festivals compete for the highest possible award for a vallenato accordion player: the pilonera mayor prize. this is the worlds largest competitive accordion festival.norte6, the accordion has rose to popularity in china throughout the years, thanks to russian teachers and being a popular instrument in the peoples liberation army, and remains very popular. the most expensive accordions are typically fully hand-made, particularly the reeds; completely hand-made reeds have a better tonal quality than even the best automatically manufactured ones. some accordions have been modified by individuals striving to bring a more pure sound out of low-end instruments, such as the ones improved by yutaka usui, a japanese craftsman.the manufacture of an accordion is only a partly automated process. in a sense, all accordions are handmade, since there is always some hand assembly of the small parts required. the general process involves making the individual parts, assembling the subsections, assembling the entire instrument, and final decorating and packaging.famous centres of production are the italian cities of stradella and castelfidardo, with many small and medium size manufacturers especially at the latter. castelfidardo honours the memory of paolo soprani who was one of the first large-scale producers. maugein freres has built accordions in the french town of tulle since 1919, and the company is now the last complete-process manufacturer of accordions in france. german companies such as hohner and weltmeister made large numbers of accordions, but production diminished by the end of the 20th century.  hohner still manufactures its top-end models in germany, and weltmeister instruments are still handmade by harmona akkordeon gmbh in klingenthal.",1,0
"nude swimming, or skinny dipping, is the practice of bathing naked, whether in natural bodies of water, in swimming pools, or in hot tubs. the term skinny-dip was first recorded in english in 1947.in 1449, the bishop of bath and wells, thomas beckynton, issued the following ""injunction and order to the archdeacon of bath and his official, and all the rectors, vicars and chaplains of the city and archdeaconry of bath"":on a report which has reached the ears of the bishop that the heavenly gift of warm and healing waters with which the city of bath has been endowed from of old is turned into an abuse by the shamelessness and uncleanness of the people of that city, insomuch that, when any persons, whether male or female, go to the said waters to bathe and recover their health, and through modesty and shame try to cover their privy parts, the men with drawers the woodcut illustrations in everard digbys 1587 book the art of swimming thomas guidott set up a medical practice in the english town of bath in 1668. he became interested in the curative properties of the waters. in 1676, he wrote a discourse of bathe, and the hot waters there. also, some enquiries into the nature of the water. this brought the health-giving properties of the hot mineral waters to the attention of the aristocracy. doctors and quacks set up spa towns such as harrogate, bath, matlock and buxton soon after taking advantage of mineral water from chalybeate springs.by 1709, working people had been visiting the coast to be dipped for health or to bathe for leisure for some time. in 1709, a man from crosby had his daughters dipped in the sea to cure a skin complaint. the bath corporation official bathing dress code of 1737, prohibited men and women to swim nude either in the day or in the night. baths specific rules were prescribed as follows:it is ordered established and decreed by this corporation that no male person above the age of ten years shall at any time hereafter go into any bath or baths within this city by day or by night without a pair of drawers and a waistcoat on their bodies. and that no female person shall at any time hereafter go into a bath or baths within this city by day or by night without a decent shift on their bodies. and that no man guide shall at any time hereafter go into any bath or baths within this city by day or by night without a pair of drawers and a waistcoat on their bodies and that each guide shall wear a cap with a tassel to it to distinguish them from the people upon pain that every one offending therein to forfeit and loose for each offence the sum of 3s. 4d. of current money of great britain to be paid to the chamberlain of the said city for the time being within three days next after each offence shall be committed to and for the use of the poor of the said city.in the early 1730s, fashionable sea bathing initially followed the inland health seeking tradition. sea bathing resorts modelled themselves on bath, and provided promenades, circulating libraries and assembly rooms. while sea bathing or dipping, men and boys were naked. women and girls were encouraged to dip wearing loose clothing. scarborough was the first resort to provide bathing machines for changing. some men extended this to swimming in the sea and by 1736 it was seen at brighton and margate, and later at deal, eastbourne and portsmouth.in england, bathing in the sea by the lower classes was noted in southampton by thomas gray in 1764, and in exmouth in 1779. in lancashire, working women and men bathed naked in the sea together in 1795: ""lower classes of people of both sexes made an annual pilgrimage to liverpool where they dabbled in the salt water for hours at each tide in promiscuous numbers and not much embarrassing themselves about appearance.""at the beginning of the victorian period in england, men and boys typically swam naked in the sea near bathing machines that were used by women. there were some efforts to designate separate beach sections for males and females. on the river cherwell near the university of oxford, an area for male nude bathing was known as parsons pleasure; a nearby area for female nude bathing which closed in 1970 was known as dames delight.in the latter half of the 19th century, the rise of the influence of christian evangelicals caused arrangements for mixed bathing to be reassessed. moral pressures led some town councils to establish zones for the women and men to bathe separately. these areas were not policed; mixed bathing was a popular activity. resorts attempted to placate the evangelicals without upsetting traditional bathers. there are very few records of magistrates enforcing the bylaws. in 1895 cosmopolitan reported: ""at most english resorts, buff bathing is available before eight oclock in the morning"" while brighton, worthing, hastings, bexhill, bognor and folkestone still tolerated nude bathing at any time of the day, in areas away from the central bathing areas.drawers, or cale3, 1891 in the syracuse sunday herald suggests naked boys of up to 15 years in age were problematic for american parents with daughters, and read:a bewildered american writes to the london standard that he cant take his little girl to play in the sand at a british seaside resort without her being surrounded by crowds of naked boys. an english friend told him that they let their daughters play with naked boys of ten years of age, but draw the line at fifteen.from 1873, the east london, eastern cape town council promulgated measures to control swimming hours, apparel and especially separate swimming areas for men and women. these regulations were too conservative and constraining for the taste of the residents of this coastal town and for several decades they were the subject of legal battles, or were simply ignored. the dispute was finally settled in 1906 when mixed bathing was permitted with the proviso that both men and women should wear suitable swimming costumes.u.s. president john quincy adams was known to skinny-dip.in the united states, skinny dipping by boys was common. the dixon, illinois evening telegraph 1890 published a request: ""for boys swimming in the mill race to be more modest as women felt they cant go down water street for fear of seeing them.""swim class for boys, england, c. 1914naked boys, clothed girls in trafalgar square, c. 1912two nude boys walking down road to swimming hole . according to the dawn, in the early 1900s, ""women were expected to wear cumbersome dress and pantaloon combinations when swimming. in 1907, at the height of her popularity, australian swimmer annette kellermann was arrested on revere beach, massachusetts, for indecency for wearing one of her ""fitted one-piece costumes"". in a 1909 new york elementary schools swimming competition, boys in the 800s, schools and ymcas built swimming pools for purposes of physical fitness and swimming instruction. pool chlorination was not available, and there were concerns about disease. in addition, fibers from cotton and wool swimsuits could clog pool filters. nude swimming allowed for swimmers to be visually inspected to check for open wounds or other signs of infectious disease. in 1926, the american public health association  swimming policies at american high schools and junior high schools were influenced by apha guidelines. from 1926 until 1962, every edition of the guidelines recommended nude swimming for males. school swimming classes were sex-segregated. for a time, swimming trunks were not permitted in ymca pools. the october 16, 1950 life magazine had a large illustration of boys swimming together in the indoor pool of new trier high school in winnetka, illinois; the caption did not mention they were naked.nude female swimming was not allowed in most schools, both for modesty reasons and because it would be awkward to accommodate menstruating girls. the detroit public schools briefly allowed nude female swimming in 1947; this policy was revoked after three weeks due to protests from parents.new developments like pool chlorination, improved pool filtration, and nylon swimsuits led the apha to abandon its recommendation of nude pool swimming for males in 1962. however, the custom of enforced nude swimming for males did not immediately cease. in 1961, parents and students in menasha, wisconsin asked the school board to give boys permission to wear swim trunks to swimming practice. the board voted down the petition on the grounds that buying swim trunks would be expensive and that nude swimming built mens character; one board member asserted that ""this experience is a good one for later life, for example the armed services, where the disregard for privacy is real and serious"".during the 1970s, cultural and legal changes led to the gradual abandonment of enforced nude male swimming in schools. federal title ix rules mandating equality in physical education classes led most schools to switch to co-educational gym classes by 1980, making nude swimming culturally unacceptable.since the early 20th century, the naturist movement has developed in western countries. the naturist movement seeks a return to non-sexual nudity when swimming and during other appropriate activities.in many countries in the 21st century, nude swimming mostly takes place at nude beaches, naturist facilities, private swimming pools, or secluded or segregated public swimming areas. some western countries, such as canada and the united kingdom, have no laws prohibiting nude swimming in public areas, but some countries around the world strictly enforce various laws against public nudity, including nude swimming. some jurisdictions which maintain laws against public nudity may turn a blind eye to incidents of skinny dipping depending on the circumstances, as police officers on the spot decline to make arrests.a 2006 roper poll showed that 25% of all american adults had been skinny dipping at least once, and that 74% believed nude swimming should be tolerated at accepted locations. nude swimming is fairly common in rural areas of the united states, where unexpected visitors are less likely. however, in some places, even that type of swimming is prohibited by law. there is no federal law against nudity. nude beaches such as baker beach in san francisco operate within federal park lands in california. however, under a provision called concurrent jurisdiction, federal park rangers may enforce state and local laws against nudity or invite local authorities to do so. skinny-dippers generally deal with this by keeping an eye out for local patrols, who generally do not go out of their way to find violators. many swimmers in the united states confine nude swimming to private locations due to concerns about attitudes to public nudity.in germany, nude bathing is more widespread than in many other countries. a 2014 study revealed germans the world record for the largest skinny dip--2,505 persons--was set on 9 june 2018 at meaghermore beach in county wicklow, ireland. the record was set at an annual all-womens event known as strip and dip, which was created by cancer survivor deirdre featherstone. the 2018 event raised money for a national childrens cancer charity.nude swimming was a common subject of old masters 1 edition had norman rockwells painting no swimming, depicting boys in various states of undress escaping from the local authorities.notesbibliography",1,0
"social work is an academic discipline and practice-based profession that concerns itself with individuals, families, groups, communities and society as a whole in an effort to meet basic needs and enhance social functioning, self-determination, collective responsibility, and overall well-being. social functioning is defined as the ability of an individual to perform their social roles within their own self, their immediate social environment, and the society at large. social work applies social sciences, such as sociology, psychology, political science, public health, community development, law, and economics, to engage with client systems, conduct assessments, and develop interventions to solve social and personal problems; and to bring about social change. social work practice is often divided into micro-work, which involves working directly with individuals or small groups; and macro-work, which involves working with communities, and 000s focus was on managed care movement which aimed at a health care delivery system to eliminate unnecessary and inappropriate care to reduce costs & recovery movement in which by principle acknowledges that many people with serious mental illness spontaneously recover and others recover and improve with proper treatment.role of social workers made an impact with 2003 invasion of iraq and war in afghanistan  in 2009, a high level of suicides was reached among active-duty soldiers: 160 confirmed or suspected army suicides. in 2008, the marine corps had a record 52 suicides. the stress of long and repeated deployments to war zones, the dangerous and confusing nature of both wars, wavering public support for the wars, and reduced troop morale have all contributed to the escalating mental health issues. military and civilian social workers are primary service providers in the veterans00 bc describes various factors of mental stability. it also has instructions regarding how to set up a care delivery system. in the same era, siddha was a medical system in south india. the great sage agastya was one of the 18 siddhas contributing to a system of medicine. this system has included the agastiyar kirigai nool, a compendium of psychiatric disorders and their recommended treatments. in atharva veda too there are descriptions and resolutions about mental health afflictions. in the mughal period unani system of medicine was introduced by an indian physician unhammad in 1222. the existing form of psychotherapy was known then as ilaj-i-nafsani in unani medicine.the 18th century was a very unstable period in indian history, which contributed to psychological and social chaos in the indian subcontinent. in 1745, lunatic asylums were developed in bombay  the first lunacy act  techniques similar to the current token-economy were first started in 1920 and called by the name habit formation chart at the cip, ranchi. in 1937, the first post of psychiatric social worker was created in the child guidance clinic run by the dhorabji tata school of social work after independence in 1947, general hospital psychiatry units in various parts of the country, in mental health service settings, social workers were employed at the ram manohar lohia hospital. in 1960, the madras mental hospital in 1966 by the recommendation mental health advisory committee, ministry of health, government of india, nimhans commenced department of psychiatric social work started and a two-year postgraduate diploma in psychiatric social work was introduced in 1968. in 1978, the nomenclature of the course was changed to mphil in psychiatric social work. subsequently, a phd programme was introduced. by the recommendations mudaliar committee in 1962, diploma in psychiatric social work was started in 1970 at the european mental hospital at ranchi a new initiative to integrate mental health with general health services started in 1975 in india. the ministry of health, government of india formulated the national mental health programme  this model has been implemented in all the states and currently there are 125 dmhp sites in india.national human rights commission  in 2016 mental health care bill was passed which ensures and legally entitles access to treatments with coverage from insurance, safeguarding dignity of the afflicted person, improving legal and healthcare access and allows for free medications. in december 2016, disabilities act 1995 was repealed with rights of persons with disabilities act mental health in india is in its developing stages. there arent enough professionals to support the demand. according to the indian psychiatric society, there are around 9000 psychiatrists only in the country as of january 2019. going by this figure, india has 0.75 psychiatrists per 100,000 population, while the desirable number is anything above 3 psychiatrists per 100,000. while the number of psychiatrists has increased since 2010, it is still far from a healthy ratio.lack of any universally accepted single licensing authority compared to foreign countries puts social workers at general in risk. but general bodies/councils accepts automatically a university-qualified social worker as a professional licensed to practice or as a qualified clinician. lack of a centralized council in tie-up with schools of social work also makes a decline in promotion for the scope of social workers as mental health professionals. though in this midst the service of social workers has given a facelift to the mental health sector in the country with other allied professionals.social work is an interdisciplinary profession, meaning it draws from a number of areas, such as abraham flexner in a 1915 lecture, ""is social work a profession?"", delivered at the national conference on charities and corrections, examined the characteristics of a profession concerning social work. it is not a single model, such as that of health, followed by medical professions such as nurses and doctors, but an integrated profession, and the likeness with medical profession is that social work requires a continued study for professional development to retain knowledge and skills that are evidence-based by practice standards. a social work professionals services lead toward the aim of providing beneficial services to individuals, dyads, families, groups, organizations, and communities to achieve optimum psychosocial functioning.its seven core functions are described by popple and leighninger as:six other core values identified by the national association of social workers  code of ethics are:a historic and defining feature of social work is the professions focus on individual well-being in a social context and the well-being of society. social workers promote social justice and social change with and on behalf of clients. a ""client"" can be an individual, family, group, organization, or community. in the broadening scope of the modern social workers role, some practitioners have in recent years traveled to war-torn countries to provide psychosocial assistance to families and survivors.newer areas of social work practice involve management science. the growth of ""social work administration"" for transforming social policies into services and directing activities of an organization toward achievement of goals is a related field. helping clients with accessing benefits such as unemployment insurance and disability benefits, to assist individuals and families in building savings and acquiring assets to improve their financial security over the long-term, to manage large operations, etc. requires social workers to know financial management skills to help clients and organizations to be financially self-sufficient.financial social work also helps clients with low-income or low to middle-income, people who are either unbanked  another area that social workers are focusing is risk management, risk in social work is taken as knight in 1921 defined ""if you dont even know for sure what will happen, but you know the odds, that is risk and if you dont even know the odds, that is uncertainty."" risk management in social work means minimizing the risks while increasing potential benefits for clients by analyzing the risks and benefits in the duty of care or decisions.in the united states, according to the substance abuse and mental health services administration examples of fields a social worker may be employed in are poverty relief, life skills education, community organizing, community organization, community development, rural development, forensics and corrections, legislation, industrial relations, project management, child protection, elder protection, womens rights, human rights, systems optimization, finance, addictions rehabilitation, child development, cross-cultural mediation, occupational safety and health, disaster management, mental health, psychosocial therapy, disabilities, etc.social workers play many roles in mental health settings, including those of case manager, advocate, administrator, and therapist. the major functions of a psychiatric social worker are promotion and prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation. social workers may also practice:psychiatric social workers conduct psychosocial assessments of the patients and work to enhance patient and family communications with the medical team members and ensure the inter-professional cordiality in the team to secure patients with the best possible care and to be active partners in their care planning. depending upon the requirement, social workers are often involved in illness education, counseling and psychotherapy. in all areas, they are pivotal to the aftercare process to facilitate a careful transition back to family and community.the education of social workers begins with a bachelors degree  the cswe even accredits online masters in social work programs in traditional and advanced standing options. in 1898, the new york charity organization society, which was the columbia university school of social works earliest entity, began offering formal ""social philanthropy"" courses, marking both the beginning date for social work education in the united states, as well as the launching of professional social work.several countries and jurisdictions require registration or licensure of people working as social workers, and there are mandated qualifications. in other places, a professional association sets academic requirements for admission to the profession. the success of these professional bodies efforts is demonstrated in that these same requirements are recognized by employers as necessary for employment.social workers have several professional associations that provide ethical guidance and other forms of support for their members and social work in general. these associations may be international, continental, semi-continental, national, or regional. the main international associations are the international federation of social workers  is a professional organization for social workers who practice within the community organizing, policy, and political spheres.in the uk, the professional association is the british association of social workers  service, social justice, dignity and worth of the person, importance of human relationships, integrity, and competence.in the united kingdom, just over half of social workers are employed by local authorities, and many of these are represented by unison, the public sector employee union. smaller numbers are members of the unite the union and the gmb  and as recently as 2004, another critic claimed to have difficulty finding novels featuring a main character holding a master of social work degree.however, social workers have been the subject of many novels, including:",1,0
"gunpowder, also known as the retronym black powder to distinguish it from modern smokeless powder, is the earliest known chemical explosive. it consists of a mixture of sulfur  gunpowder has been widely used as a propellant in firearms, artillery, rocketry, and pyrotechnics, including use as a blasting agent for explosives in quarrying, mining, and road building.gunpowder was invented in 9th-century china as one of the four great inventions, and spread throughout most parts of eurasia by the end of the 13th century. originally developed by the taoists for medicinal purposes, gunpowder was first used for warfare around 904 ad.gunpowder is classified as a low explosive because of its relatively slow decomposition rate and consequently low brisance. low explosives deflagrate  today gunpowder firearms are limited primarily to hunting, target shooting, and bulletless historical reenactments.a simple, commonly cited, chemical equation for the combustion of black powder is:a balanced, but still simplified, equation is:gunpowder does not burn as a single reaction, so the byproducts are not easily predicted. one study showed that it produced gunpowder is a low explosive: it does not detonate, but rather deflagrates  or monumental stone such as granite and marble. black powder is well suited for blank rounds, signal flares, burst charges, and rescue-line launches. black powder is also used in fireworks for lifting shells, in rockets as fuel, and in certain special effects.combustion converts less than half the mass of black powder to gas, most of it turns into particulate matter. some of it is ejected, wasting propelling power, fouling the air, and generally being a nuisance the first confirmed reference to what can be considered gunpowder in china occurred in the 9th century ad during the tang dynasty, first in a formula contained in the taishang shengzu jindan mijue  the taishang shengzu jindan mijue mentions a gunpowder formula composed of six parts sulfur to six parts saltpeter to one part birthwort herb. according to the zhenyuan miaodao yaol noted saltpeter burnt with a purple flame, providing a practical and reliable means of distinguishing it from other inorganic salts, thus enabling alchemists to evaluate and compare purification techniques; the earliest latin accounts of saltpeter purification are dated after 1200.the earliest chemical formula for gunpowder appeared in the 11th century song dynasty text, wujing zongyao  the wujing zongyao provides encyclopedia references to a variety of mixtures that included petrochemicals81, during the mongol invasions of japan.by 1083 the song court was producing hundreds of thousands of fire arrows for their garrisons. bombs and the first proto-guns, known as ""fire lances"", became prominent during the 12th century and were used by the song during the jin-song wars. fire lances were first recorded to have been used at the siege of dean in 1132 by song forces against the jin. in the early 13th century the jin utilized iron-casing bombs. projectiles were added to fire lances, and re-usable fire lance barrels were developed, first out of hardened paper, and then metal. by 1257 some fire lances were firing wads of bullets. in the late 13th century metal fire lances became eruptors, proto-cannons firing co-viative projectiles the muslims acquired knowledge of gunpowder some time between 1240 and 1280, by which point the syrian hasan al-rammah had written, in arabic, recipes for gunpowder, instructions for the purification of saltpeter, and descriptions of gunpowder incendiaries. it is implied by al-rammahs usage of ""terms that suggested he derived his knowledge from chinese sources"" and his references to saltpeter as ""chinese snow""  however, because al-rammah attributes his material to ""his father and forefathers"", al-hassan argues that gunpowder became prevalent in syria and egypt by ""the end of the twelfth century or the beginning of the thirteenth"". in persia saltpeter was known as ""chinese salt""  or ""salt from chinese salt marshes"" hasan al-rammah included 107 gunpowder recipes in his text al-furusiyyah wa al-manasib al-harbiyya al-hassan claims that in the battle of ain jalut of 1260, the mamluks used against the mongols in ""the first cannon in history"" gunpowder formula with near-identical ideal composition ratios for explosive gunpowder. other historians urge caution regarding claims of islamic firearms use in the 12044 period as late medieval arabic texts used the same word for gunpowder, naft, that they used for an earlier incendiary, naphtha.khan claims that it was invading mongols who introduced gunpowder to the islamic world and cites mamluk antagonism towards early musketeers in their infantry as an example of how gunpowder weapons were not always met with open acceptance in the middle east. similarly, the refusal of their qizilbash forces to use firearms contributed to the safavid rout at chaldiran in 1514.the musket appeared in the ottoman empire by 1465. in 1598, chinese writer zhao shizhen described turkish muskets as being superior to european muskets. the chinese military book wu pei chih the state-controlled manufacture of gunpowder by the ottoman empire through early supply chains to obtain nitre, sulfur and high-quality charcoal from oaks in anatolia contributed significantly to its expansion between the 15th and 18th century. it was not until later in the 19th century when the syndicalist production of turkish gunpowder was greatly reduced, which coincided with the decline of its military might.some sources mention possible gunpowder weapons being deployed by the mongols against european forces at the battle of mohi in 1241. professor kenneth warren chase credits the mongols for introducing into europe gunpowder and its associated weaponry. however, there is no clear route of transmission, and while the mongols are often pointed to as the likeliest vector, timothy may points out that ""there is no concrete evidence that the mongols used gunpowder weapons on a regular basis outside of china."" however, timothy may also points out ""however... the mongols used the gunpowder weapon in their wars against the jin, the song and in their invasions of japan.""the earliest western accounts of gunpowder appears in texts written by english philosopher roger bacon in 1267 called opus majus and opus tertium. the oldest written recipes for gunpowder in europe were recorded under the name marcus graecus or mark the greek between 1280 and 1300 in the liber ignium, or book of fires.records show that, in england, gunpowder was being made in 1346 at the tower of london; a powder house existed at the tower in 1461; and in 1515 three kings gunpowder makers worked there. gunpowder was also being made or stored at other royal castles, such as portchester. the english civil war in late 14th century europe, gunpowder was improved by corning, the practice of drying gunpowder into small clumps to improve combustion and consistency. during this time, european manufacturers also began regularly purifying saltpeter, using wood ashes containing potassium carbonate to precipitate calcium from their dung liquor, and using ox blood, alum, and slices of turnip to clarify the solution.during the renaissance, two european schools of pyrotechnic thought emerged, one in italy and the other at nuremberg, germany. in italy, vannoccio biringuccio, born in 1480, was a member of the guild fraternita di santa barbara but broke with the tradition of secrecy by setting down everything he knew in a book titled de la pirotechnia, written in vernacular.  it was published posthumously in 1540, with 9 editions over 138 years, and also reprinted by mit press in 1966.by the mid-17th century fireworks were used for entertainment on an unprecedented scale in europe, being popular even at resorts and public gardens. with the publication of deutliche anweisung zur feuerwerkerey  in 1774 louis xvi ascended to the throne of france at age 20.  after he discovered that france was not self-sufficient in gunpowder, a gunpowder administration was established; to head it, the lawyer antoine lavoisier was appointed. although from a bourgeois family, after his degree in law lavoisier became wealthy from a company set up to collect taxes for the crown; this allowed him to pursue experimental natural science as a hobby.without access to cheap saltpeter  this caused farmers, the wealthy, or entire villages to bribe the petermen and the associated bureaucracy to leave their buildings alone and the saltpeter uncollected.  lavoisier instituted a crash program to increase saltpeter production, revised two british physicists, andrew noble and frederick abel, worked to improve the properties of black powder during the late 19th century. this formed the basis for the noble-abel gas equation for internal ballistics.the introduction of smokeless powder in the late 19th century led to a contraction of the gunpowder industry. after the end of world war i, the majority of the united kingdom gunpowder manufacturers merged into a single company, ""explosives trades limited""; and a number of sites were closed down, including those in ireland. this company became nobel industries limited; and in 1926 became a founding member of imperial chemical industries. the home office removed gunpowder from its list of permitted explosives; and shortly afterwards, on 31 december 1931, the former curtis & harveys glynneath gunpowder factory at pontneddfechan, in wales, closed down, and it was demolished by fire in 1932. the last remaining gunpowder mill at the royal gunpowder factory, waltham abbey was damaged by a german parachute mine in 1941 and it never reopened. this was followed by the closure of the gunpowder section at the royal ordnance factory, rof chorley, the section was closed and demolished at the end of world war ii; and ici nobels roslin gunpowder factory, which closed in 1954. this left the sole united kingdom gunpowder factory at ici nobels ardeer site in scotland; it too closed in october 1976.gunpowder and gunpowder weapons were transmitted to india through the mongol invasions of india. the mongols were defeated by alauddin khalji of the delhi sultanate, and some of the mongol soldiers remained in northern india after their conversion to islam. it was written in the tarikh-i firishta  firearms known as top-o-tufak also existed in many muslim kingdoms in india by as early as 1366. from then on the employment of gunpowder warfare in india was prevalent, with events such as the ""siege of belgaum"" in 1473 by sultan muhammad shah bahmani.the shipwrecked ottoman admiral seydi ali reis is known to have introduced the earliest type of matchlock weapons, which the ottomans used against the portuguese during the siege of diu  guns made of bronze were recovered from calicut the mughal emperor akbar mass-produced matchlocks for the mughal army. akbar is personally known to have shot a leading rajput commander during the siege of chittorgarh. the mughals began to use bamboo rockets  bengal and m.cannons were introduced to majapahit when kublai khans chinese army under the leadership of ike mese sought to invade java in 1293. history of yuan mentioned that the mongol used cannons  cannons were used by the ayutthaya kingdom in 1352 during its invasion of the khmer empire. within a decade large quantities of gunpowder could be found in the khmer empire. by the end of the century firearms were also used by the tr45 the knowledge of making ""true"" firearms came much later, after the middle of the 15th century. it was brought by the islamic nations of west asia, most probably the arabs. the precise year of introduction is unknown, but it may be safely concluded to be no earlier than 1460.:23 before the arrival of the portuguese in southeast asia, the natives already possessed primitive firearms, the java arquebus. portuguese influence to local weaponry, particularly after the capture of malacca portuguese and spanish invaders were unpleasantly surprised and even outgunned on occasion. circa 1540, the javanese, always alert for new weapons found the newly arrived portuguese weaponry superior to that of the locally made variants. majapahit-era cetbang cannons were further improved and used in the demak sultanate period during the demak invasion of portuguese malacca. during this period, the iron for manufacturing javanese cannons was imported from khorasan in northern persia. the material was known by javanese as wesi kurasani  when the portuguese came to the archipelago, they referred to it as ber60-pounders, weighing anywhere between 3 hours. this formed a graphite coating on each grain that reduced its ability to absorb moisture.neither the use of graphite nor sodium nitrate was new. glossing gunpowder corns with graphite was already an accepted technique in 1839, and sodium nitrate-based blasting powder had been made in peru for many years using the sodium nitrate mined at tarapac.5% charcoal, 12.5% sulfur. english war powder in 1879 used the ratio 75% saltpeter, 15% charcoal, 10% sulfur. the british congreve rockets used 62.4% saltpeter, 23.2% charcoal and 14.4% sulfur, but the british mark vii gunpowder was changed to 65% saltpeter, 20% charcoal and 15% sulfur. the explanation for the wide variety in formulation relates to usage. powder used for rocketry can use a slower burn rate since it accelerates the projectile for a much longer time% moisture. prismatic brown powder is a large-grained product the rottweil company introduced in 1884 in germany, which was adopted by the british royal navy shortly thereafter. the french navy adopted a fine, 3.1 millimeter, not prismatic grained product called slow burning cocoa lesmok powder was a product developed by dupont in 1911, one of several semi-smokeless products in the industry containing a mixture of black and nitrocellulose powder. it was sold to winchester and others primarily for .22 and .32 small calibers. its advantage was that it was believed at the time to be less corrosive than smokeless powders then in use.  it was not understood in the u.s. until the 1920s that the actual source of corrosion was the potassium chloride residue from potassium chlorate sensitized primers.  the bulkier black powder fouling better disperses primer residue.  failure to mitigate primer corrosion by dispersion caused the false impression that nitrocellulose-based powder caused corrosion. lesmok had some of the bulk of black powder for dispersing primer residue, but somewhat less total bulk than straight black powder, thus requiring less frequent bore cleaning. it was last sold by winchester in 1947.the development of smokeless powders, such as cordite, in the late 19th century created the need for a spark-sensitive priming charge, such as gunpowder. however, the sulfur content of traditional gunpowders caused corrosion problems with cordite mk i and this led to the introduction of a range of sulfur-free gunpowders, of varying grain sizes. they typically contain 70.5 parts of saltpeter and 29.5 parts of charcoal. like black powder, they were produced in different grain sizes. in the united kingdom, the finest grain was known as sulfur-free mealed powder the original dry-compounded powder used in 15th-century europe was known as ""serpentine"", either a reference to satan or to a common artillery piece that used it. the ingredients were groundtogether with a mortar and pestle, perhaps for 24 hours, resulting in a fine flour.  vibration during transportation could cause the components to separate again, requiring remixing in the field. also if the quality of the saltpeter was low the advent of much more powerful and easy to use corned powder changed this procedure, but serpentine was used with older guns into the 17th century.for propellants to oxidize and burn rapidly and effectively, the combustible ingredients must be reduced to the smallest possible particle sizes, and be as thoroughly mixed as possible. once mixed, however, for better results in a gun, makers discovered that the final product should be in the form of individual dense grains that spread the fire quickly from grain to grain, much as straw or twigs catch fire more quickly than a pile of sawdust.in late 14th century europe and china, gunpowder was improved by wet grinding; liquid, such as distilled spirits was added during the grinding-together of the ingredients and the moist paste dried afterwards. the principle of wet mixing to prevent the separation of dry ingredients, invented for gunpowder, is used today in the pharmaceutical industry. it was discovered that if the paste was rolled into balls before drying the resulting gunpowder absorbed less water from the air during storage and traveled better. the balls were then crushed in a mortar by the gunner immediately before use, with the old problem of uneven particle size and packing causing unpredictable results. if the right size particles were chosen, however, the result was a great improvement in power.  forming the damp paste into corn-sized clumps by hand or with the use of a sieve instead of larger balls produced a product after drying that loaded much better, as each tiny piece provided its own surrounding air space that allowed much more rapid combustion than a fine powder.  this ""corned"" gunpowder was from 30% to 300% more powerful. an example is cited where 34 pounds of serpentine was needed to shoot a 47-pound ball, but only 18 pounds of corned powder.because the dry powdered ingredients must be mixed and bonded together for extrusion and cut into grains to maintain the blend, size reduction and mixing is done while the ingredients are damp, usually with water. after 1800, instead of forming grains by hand or with sieves, the damp mill-cake was pressed in molds to increase its density and extract the liquid, forming press-cake. the pressing took varying amounts of time, depending on conditions such as atmospheric humidity.  the hard, dense product was broken again into tiny pieces, which were separated with sieves to produce a uniform product for each purpose: coarse powders for cannons, finer grained powders for muskets, and the finest for small hand guns and priming. inappropriately fine-grained powder often caused cannons to burst before the projectile could move down the barrel, due to the high initial spike in pressure. mammoth powder with large grains, made for rodmans 15-inch cannon, reduced the pressure to only 20 percent as high as ordinary cannon powder would have produced.in the mid-19th century, measurements were made determining that the burning rate within a grain of black powder modern corning first compresses the fine black powder meal into blocks with a fixed density  in the united states, gunpowder grains were designated f  other versions had grains the size of golf and tennis balls for use in 20-inch  in 1875 dupont introduced hexagonal powder for large artillery, which was pressed using shaped plates with a small center core german makers also produced hexagonal grained powders of a similar size for artillery.by the late 19th century manufacturing focused on standard grades of black powder from fg used in large bore rifles and shotguns, through ffg  a coarser grade for use in military artillery blanks was designated a-1. these grades were sorted on a system of screens with oversize retained on a mesh of 6 wires per inch, a-1 retained on 10 wires per inch, fg retained on 14, ffg on 24, fffg on 46, and ffffg on 60. fines designated fffffg were usually reprocessed to minimize explosive dust hazards. in the united kingdom, the main service gunpowders were classified rfg  gunpowder grains can alternatively be categorized by mesh size: the bss sieve mesh size, being the smallest mesh size, which retains no grains. recognized grain sizes are gunpowder g 7, g 20, g 40, and g 90.owing to the large market of antique and replica black-powder firearms in the us, modern  black powder substitutes like pyrodex, triple seven and black mag3 pellets have been developed since the 1970s. these products, which should not be confused with smokeless powders, aim to produce less fouling for the most powerful black powder, meal powder, a wood charcoal, is used. the best wood for the purpose is pacific willow, but others such as alder or buckthorn can be used. in great britain between the 15th and 19th centuries charcoal from alder buckthorn was greatly prized for gunpowder manufacture; cottonwood was used by the american confederate states. the ingredients are reduced in particle size and mixed as intimately as possible. originally, this was with a mortar-and-pestle or a similarly operating stamping-mill, using copper, bronze or other non-sparking materials, until supplanted by the rotating ball mill principle with non-sparking bronze or lead. historically, a marble or limestone edge runner mill, running on a limestone bed, was used in great britain; however, by the mid 19th century this had changed to either an iron-shod stone wheel or a cast iron wheel running on an iron bed. the mix was dampened with alcohol or water during grinding to prevent accidental ignition. this also helps the extremely soluble saltpeter to mix into the microscopic pores of the very high surface-area charcoal.around the late 14th century, european powdermakers first began adding liquid during grinding to improve mixing, reduce dust, and with it the risk of explosion. the powder-makers would then shape the resulting paste of dampened gunpowder, known as mill cake, into corns, or grains, to dry. not only did corned powder keep better because of its reduced surface area, gunners also found that it was more powerful and easier to load into guns. before long, powder-makers standardized the process by forcing mill cake through sieves instead of corning powder by hand.the improvement was based on reducing the surface area of a higher density composition. at the beginning of the 19th century, makers increased density further by static pressing. they shoveled damp mill cake into a two-foot square box, placed this beneath a screw press and reduced it to  its volume. ""press cake"" had the hardness of slate. they broke the dried slabs with hammers or rollers, and sorted the granules with sieves into different grades.  in the united states, eleuthere irenee du pont, who had learned the trade from lavoisier, tumbled the dried grains in rotating barrels to round the edges and increase durability during shipping and handling. the following year  this is nowadays called the wakefield process, after the owners of the company. it would have used potassium chloride from the sta\xc3\x9ffurt mines, near magdeburg, germany, which had recently become available in industrial quantities.during the 18th century, gunpowder factories became increasingly dependent on mechanical energy. despite mechanization, production difficulties related to humidity control, especially during the pressing, were still present in the late 19th century. a paper from 1885 laments that ""gunpowder is such a nervous and sensitive spirit, that in almost every process of manufacture it changes under our hands as the weather changes."" pressing times to the desired density could vary by a factor of three depending on the atmospheric humidity.the united nations model regulations on the transportation of dangerous goods and national transportation authorities, such as united states department of transportation, have classified gunpowder  the ""stud gun"" drove nails or screws into solid concrete, a function not possible with hydraulic tools. today powder-actuated tools are still an important part of various industries, but the cartridges usually use smokeless powders. industrial shotguns have been used to eliminate persistent material rings in operating rotary kilns gunpowder has occasionally been employed for other purposes besides weapons, mining, fireworks and construction:",1,0
"the cat  it is the only domesticated species in the family felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family. a cat can either be a house cat, a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human contact. domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to hunt rodents. about 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries.the cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable claws adapted to killing small prey. its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. cat communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting as well as cat-specific body language. a predator that is most active at dawn and dusk, the cat is a solitary hunter but a social species. it can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by mice and other small mammals. it secretes and perceives pheromones.female domestic cats can have kittens from spring to late autumn, with litter sizes often ranging from two to five kittens. domestic cats are bred and shown at events as registered pedigreed cats, a hobby known as cat fancy. failure to control breeding of pet cats by spaying and neutering, as well as abandonment of pets, resulted in large numbers of feral cats worldwide, contributing to the extinction of entire bird, mammal, and reptile species, and evoking population control.cats were first domesticated in the near east around 7500017, the domestic cat was the second-most popular pet in the united states, with 95 million cats owned. in the united kingdom, around 7.3 million cats lived in more than 4.8 million households as of 2019.the origin of the english word cat, old english catt, is thought to be the late latin word cattus, which was first used at the beginning of the 6th century. it was suggested that the word cattus is derived from an egyptian precursor of coptic 003, the international commission on zoological nomenclature ruled that the domestic cat is a distinct species, namely felis catus.in 2007, it was considered a subspecies, f. silvestris catus, of the european wildcat   in 2017, the iucn cat classification taskforce followed the recommendation of the iczn in regarding the domestic cat as a distinct species, felis catus.the domestic cat is a member of the felidae, a family that had a common ancestor about 100,0000008 hectares  the timing of cats activity is quite flexible and varied, which means house cats may be more active in the morning and evening, as a response to greater human activity at these times.cats conserve energy by sleeping more than most animals, especially as they grow older. the daily duration of sleep varies, usually between 12 and 16 hours, with 13 and 14 being the average. some cats can sleep as much as 20 hours. the term ""cat nap"" for a short rest refers to the cats tendency to fall asleep the social behavior of the domestic cat ranges from widely dispersed individuals to feral cat colonies that gather around a food source, based on groups of co-operating females. within such groups, one cat is usually dominant over the others. each cat in a colony holds a distinct territory, with sexually active males having the largest territories, which are about 10 times larger than those of female cats and may overlap with several females territories. these territories are marked by urine spraying, by rubbing objects at head height with secretions from facial glands, and by defecation. between these territories are neutral areas where cats watch and greet one another without territorial conflicts. outside these neutral areas, territory holders usually chase away stranger cats, at first by staring, hissing, and growling and, if that does not work, by short but noisy and violent attacks. despite this colonial organization, cats do not have a social survival strategy or a pack mentality, and always hunt alone.life in proximity to humans and other domestic animals has led to a symbiotic social adaptation in cats, and cats may express great affection toward humans or other animals. ethologically, the human keeper of a cat functions as a sort of surrogate for the cats mother. adult cats live their lives in a kind of extended kittenhood, a form of behavioral neoteny. their high-pitched sounds may mimic the cries of a hungry human infant, making them particularly difficult for humans to ignore. however, some pet cats are poorly socialized. in particular, older cats show aggressiveness towards newly arrived kittens, which include biting and scratching; this type of behavior is known as feline asocial aggression.domestic cats scent rubbing behavior towards humans or other cats is thought to be a feline means for social bonding.domestic cats use many vocalizations for communication, including purring, trilling, hissing, growling/snarling, grunting, and several different forms of meowing. their body language, including position of ears and tail, relaxation of the whole body, and kneading of the paws, are all indicators of mood. the tail and ears are particularly important social signal mechanisms in cats. a raised tail indicates a friendly greeting, and flattened ears indicates hostility. tail-raising also indicates the cats position in the groups social hierarchy, with dominant individuals raising their tails less often than subordinate ones. feral cats are generally silent.:208 nose-to-nose touching is also a common greeting and may be followed by social grooming, which is solicited by one of the cats raising and tilting its head.purring may have developed as an evolutionary advantage as a signalling mechanism of reassurance between mother cats and nursing kittens. post-nursing cats often purr as a sign of contentment: when being petted, becoming relaxed, or eating. the mechanism by which cats purr is elusive. the cat has no unique anatomical feature that is clearly responsible for the sound.cats are known for spending considerable amounts of time licking their coats to keep them clean. the cats tongue has backwards-facing spines about 5000.7 new zealand lesser short-tailed bats in seven days. in the us, feral and free-ranging domestic cats kill an estimated 6.3 2.3 billion mammals annually.in australia, the impact of cats on mammal populations is even greater than the impact of habitat loss. more than one million reptiles are killed by feral cats each day, representing 258 species. cats have contributed to the extinction of the navassa curly-tailed lizard and chioninia coctei.domestic cats, especially young kittens, are known for their love of play. this behavior mimics hunting and is important in helping kittens learn to stalk, capture, and kill prey. cats also engage in play fighting, with each other and with humans. this behavior may be a way for cats to practice the skills needed for real combat, and might also reduce any fear they associate with launching attacks on other animals.cats also tend to play with toys more when they are hungry. owing to the close similarity between play and hunting, cats prefer to play with objects that resemble prey, such as small furry toys that move rapidly, but rapidly lose interest. they become habituated to a toy they have played with before. string is often used as a toy, but if it is eaten, it can become caught at the base of the cats tongue and then move into the intestines, a medical emergency which can cause serious illness, even death. owing to the risks posed by cats eating string, it is sometimes replaced with a laser pointers dot, which cats may chase.female cats called queens are polyestrous with several estrus cycles during a year, lasting usually 21 days. they are usually ready to mate between early february and august.several males, called tomcats, are attracted to a female in heat. they fight over her, and the victor wins the right to mate. at first, the female rejects the male, but eventually, the female allows the male to mate. the female utters a loud yowl as the male pulls out of her because a male cats penis has a band of about 1200 to 30 minutes, once the female is finished grooming, the cycle will repeat.because ovulation is not always triggered by a single mating, females may not be impregnated by the first male with which they mate. furthermore, cats are superfecund; that is, a female may mate with more than one male when she is in heat, with the result that different kittens in a litter may have different fathers.the morula forms 124 hours after conception. at 148 hours, early blastocysts form. at 10 days, implantation occurs.the gestation of queens lasts between 64 and 67 days, with an average of 65 days.data on the reproductive capacity of more than 2,300 free-ranging queens were collected during a study between may 1998 and october 2000. they had one to six kittens per litter, with an average of three kittens. they produced a mean of 1.4 litters per year, but a maximum of three litters in a year. of 169 kittens, 127 died before they were six months old due to a trauma caused in most cases by dog attacks and road accidents.the first litter is usually smaller than subsequent litters. kittens are weaned between six and seven weeks of age. queens normally reach sexual maturity at 5 weeks of age, when they are ready to leave their mother. they can be surgically sterilized  this surgery also prevents undesirable sex-related behavior, such as aggression, territory marking  in the united states, about 80% of household cats are neutered.the average lifespan of pet cats has risen in recent decades. in the early 1980s, it was about seven years,:33 rising to 9.4 years in 1995:33 and 15.1 years in 2018. some cats have been reported as surviving into their 30s, with the oldest known cat, creme puff, dying at a verified age of 38.spaying or neutering increases life expectancy: one study found neutered male cats live twice as long as intact males, while spayed female cats live 62% longer than intact females.:35 having a cat neutered confers health benefits, because castrated males cannot develop testicular cancer, spayed females cannot develop uterine or ovarian cancer, and both have a reduced risk of mammary cancer.despite widespread concern about the welfare of free-roaming cats, the lifespans of neutered feral cats in managed colonies compare favorably with those of pet cats.:45:1358about two hundred fifty heritable genetic disorders have been identified in cats, many similar to human inborn errors of metabolism. the high level of similarity among the metabolism of mammals allows many of these feline diseases to be diagnosed using genetic tests that were originally developed for use in humans, as well as the use of cats as animal models in the study of the human diseases.diseases affecting domestic cats include acute infections, parasitic infestations, injuries, and chronic diseases such as kidney disease, thyroid disease, and arthritis. vaccinations are available for many infectious diseases, as are treatments to eliminate parasites such as worms and fleas.the domestic cat is a cosmopolitan species and occurs across much of the world. it is adaptable and now present on all continents except antarctica, and on 118 of the 131 main groups of islands007 exceeded 500007. cat pelts have been used for superstitious purposes as part of the practise of witchcraft, and are still made into blankets in switzerland as folk remedies believed to help rheumatism. in the western intellectual tradition, the idea of cats as everyday objects have served to illustrate problems of quantum mechanics in the schr00 million to 60025,000 images that he drew from for publications during his lifetime.a cat show is a judged event in which the owners of cats compete to win titles in various cat-registering organizations by entering their cats to be judged after a breed standard. both pedigreed and non-purebred companion  and assessed for temperament and apparent health; the owners of those judged to be most ideal awarded a prize. moggies are judged based on their temperament and healthy appearance. some events also include activity judging, such as trained navigation of obstacle course. often, at the end of the year, all of the points accrued at various shows are added up and more national and regional titles are awarded to champion cats.cats can be infected or infested with viruses, bacteria, fungus, protozoans, arthropods or worms that can transmit diseases to humans. in some cases, the cat exhibits no symptoms of the disease, however, the same disease can then become evident in a human. the likelihood that a person will become diseased depends on the age and immune status of the person. humans who have cats living in their home or in close association are more likely to become infected, however, those who do not keep cats as pets might also acquire infections from cat feces and parasites exiting the cats body. some of the infections of most concern include salmonella, cat-scratch disease and toxoplasmosis.in ancient egypt, cats were worshipped, and the goddess bastet often depicted in cat form, sometimes taking on the war-like aspect of a lioness. the greek historian herodotus reported that killing a cat was forbidden, and when a household cat died, the entire family mourned and shaved their eyebrows. families took their dead cats to the sacred city of bubastis, where they were embalmed and buried in sacred repositories. herodotus expressed astonishment at the domestic cats in egypt, because he had only ever seen wildcats.ancient greeks and romans kept weasels as pets, which were seen as the ideal rodent-killers. the earliest unmistakable evidence of the greeks having domestic cats comes from two coins from magna graecia dating to the mid-fifth century bc showing iokastos and phalanthos, the legendary founders of rhegion and taras respectively, playing with their pet cats. the usual ancient greek word for cat was ailouros, meaning thing with the waving tail. cats are rarely mentioned in ancient greek literature. aristotle remarked in his history of animals that ""female cats are naturally lecherous."" the greeks later syncretized their own goddess artemis with the egyptian goddess bastet, adopting bastets associations with cats and ascribing them to artemis. in ovids metamorphoses, when the deities flee to egypt and take animal forms, the goddess diana turns into a cat. cats eventually displaced ferrets as the pest control of choice because they were more pleasant to have around the house and were more enthusiastic hunters of mice. during the middle ages, many of artemiss associations with cats were grafted onto the virgin mary. cats are often shown in icons of annunciation and of the holy family and, according to italian folklore, on the same night that mary gave birth to jesus, a cat in bethlehem gave birth to a kitten. domestic cats were spread throughout much of the rest of the world during the age of discovery, as ships cats were carried on sailing ships to control shipboard rodents and as good-luck charms.several ancient religions believed cats are exalted souls, companions or guides for humans, that are all-knowing but mute so they cannot influence decisions made by humans. in japan, the maneki neko cat is a symbol of good fortune. in norse mythology, freyja, the goddess of love, beauty, and fertility, is depicted as riding a chariot drawn by cats. in jewish legend, the first cat was living in the house of the first man adam as a pet that got rid of mice. the cat was once partnering with the first dog before the latter broke an oath they had made which resulted in enmity between the descendants of these two animals. it is also written that neither cats nor foxes are represented in the water, while every other animal has an incarnation species in the water. although no species are sacred in islam, cats are revered by muslims. some western writers have stated muhammad had a favorite cat, muezza. he is reported to have loved cats so much, ""he would do without his cloak rather than disturb one that was sleeping on it"". the story has no origin in early muslim writers, and seems to confuse a story of a later sufi saint, ahmed ar-rifai, centuries after muhammad. one of the companions of muhammad was known as abu hurayrah many cultures have negative superstitions about cats. an example would be the belief that a black cat ""crossing ones path"" leads to bad luck, or that cats are witches familiars used to augment a witchs powers and skills. the killing of cats in medieval ypres, belgium, is commemorated in the innocuous present-day kattenstoet  in mid-16th century france, cats would be burnt alive as a form of entertainment. according to norman davies, the assembled people ""shrieked with laughter as the animals, howling with pain, were singed, roasted, and finally carbonized"".james frazer wrote that ""it was the custom to burn a basket, barrel, or sack full of live cats, which was hung from a tall mast in the midst of the bonfire; sometimes a fox was burned. the people collected the embers and ashes of the fire and took them home, believing that they brought good luck. the french kings often witnessed these spectacles and even lit the bonfire with their own hands. in 1648 louis xiv, crowned with a wreath of roses and carrying a bunch of roses in his hand, kindled the fire, danced at it and partook of the banquet afterwards in the town hall. but this was the last occasion when a monarch presided at the midsummer bonfire in paris. at metz midsummer fires were lighted with great pomp on the esplanade, and a dozen cats, enclosed in wicker cages, were burned alive in them, to the amusement of the people. similarly at gap, in the department of the hautes-alpes, cats used to be roasted over the midsummer bonfire.""according to a myth in many cultures, cats have multiple lives. in many countries, they are believed to have nine lives, but in italy, germany, greece, brazil and some spanish-speaking regions, they are said to have seven lives, while in turkish and arabic traditions, the number of lives is six. the myth is attributed to the natural suppleness and swiftness cats exhibit to escape life-threatening situations. also lending credence to this myth is the fact that falling cats often land on their feet, using an instinctive righting reflex to twist their bodies around. nonetheless, cats can still be injured or killed by a high fall.",1,0
"barack hussein obama ii  born august 4, 1961 is an american politician and attorney who served as the 44th president of the united states from 2009 to 2017. a member of the democratic party, obama was the first african-american president of the united states. he previously served as a u.s. senator from illinois from 2005 to 2008 and an illinois state senator from 1997 to 2004.obama was born in honolulu, hawaii. after graduating from columbia university in 1983, he worked as a community organizer in chicago. in 1988, he enrolled in harvard law school, where he was the first black person to be president of the harvard law review. after graduating, he became a civil rights attorney and an academic, teaching constitutional law at the university of chicago law school from 1992 to 2004. turning to elective politics, he represented the 13th district from 1997 until 2004 in the illinois senate, when he ran for the u.s. senate. obama received national attention in 2004 with his march senate primary win, his well-received july democratic national convention keynote address, and his landslide november election to the senate. in 2008, he was nominated for president a year after his presidential campaign began, and after a close primary campaign against hillary clinton, obama was elected over republican nominee john mccain and was inaugurated alongside joe biden on january 20, 2009. nine months later, he was named the 2009 nobel peace prize laureate.obama signed many landmark bills into law during his first two years in office. the main reforms that were passed include the affordable care act  his presidency has generally been regarded favorably, and evaluations of his presidency among historians, political scientists, and the general public frequently place him among the upper tier of american presidents. obama left office in january 2017 and continues to reside in washington, d.c.obama was born on august 4, 1961, at kapiolani medical center for women and children in honolulu, hawaii. he is the only president born outside the contiguous 48 states. he was born to an american mother of european descent and an african father. his mother, ann dunham  with some german, irish, scottish, swiss, and welsh ancestry. in july 2012, ancestry.com found a strong likelihood that dunham was descended from john punch, an enslaved african man who lived in the colony of virginia during the seventeenth century. obamas father, barack obama sr.  was a married luo kenyan from nyangoma kogelo. obamas parents met in 1960 in a russian language class at the university of hawaii at manoa, where his father was a foreign student on a scholarship. the couple married in wailuku, hawaii, on february 2, 1961, six months before obama was born.in late august 1961, a few weeks after he was born, barack and his mother moved to the university of washington in seattle, where they lived for a year. during that time, the elder obama completed his undergraduate degree in economics in hawaii, graduating in june 1962. he left to attend graduate school on a scholarship at harvard university, where he earned an m.a. in economics. obamas parents divorced in march 1964. obama sr. returned to kenya in 1964, where he married for a third time and worked for the kenyan government as the senior economic analyst in the ministry of finance. he visited his son in hawaii only once, at christmas 1971, before he was killed in an automobile accident in 1982, when obama was 21 years old. recalling his early childhood, obama said, ""that my father looked nothing like the people around me to 1975 while his mother was a graduate student in anthropology at the university of hawaii. obama chose to stay in hawaii with his grandparents for high school at punahou when his mother and half-sister returned to indonesia in 1975, so his mother could begin anthropology field work. his mother spent most of the next two decades in indonesia, divorcing lolo in 1980 and earning a phd degree in 1992, before dying in 1995 in hawaii following unsuccessful treatment for ovarian and uterine cancer.obama later reflected on his years in honolulu and wrote: ""the opportunity that hawaii offered006 interview, obama highlighted the diversity of his extended family: ""its like a little mini-united nations,"" he said. ""ive got relatives who look like bernie mac, and ive got relatives who look like margaret thatcher."" obama has a half-sister with whom he was raised  obamas mother was survived by her kansas-born mother, madelyn dunham, until her death on november 2, 2008, two days before his election to the presidency. obama also has roots in ireland; he met with his irish cousins in moneygall in may 2011. in dreams from my father, obama ties his mothers family history to possible native american ancestors and distant relatives of jefferson davis, president of the confederate states of america during the american civil war. he also shares distant ancestors in common with george w. bush and dick cheney, among others.obama lived with anthropologist sheila miyoshi jager while he was a community organizer in chicago in the 1980s. he proposed to her twice, but both jager and her parents turned him down. the relationship was not made public until may 2017, several months after his presidency had ended.in june 1989, obama met michelle robinson when he was employed as a summer associate at the chicago law firm of sidley austin. robinson was assigned for three months as obamas adviser at the firm, and she joined him at several group social functions but declined his initial requests to date. they began dating later that summer, became engaged in 1991, and were married on october 3, 1992. after suffering a miscarriage, michelle underwent in vitro fertilization to conceive their children. the couples first daughter, malia ann, was born in 1998, followed by a second daughter, natasha  the obama daughters attended the university of chicago laboratory schools. when they moved to washington, d.c., in january 2009, the girls started at the sidwell friends school. the obamas have two

start treaty in april 2010, and the u.s. senate ratified it in december 2010.in december 2011, obama instructed agencies to consider lgbt rights when issuing financial aid to foreign countries. in august 2013, he criticized russias law that discriminates against gays, but he stopped short of advocating a boycott of the upcoming 2014 winter olympics in sochi, russia.in december 2014, obama announced that he intended to normalize relationships between cuba and the united states. the countries respective ""interests sections"" in one anothers capitals were upgraded to embassies on july 20, 2015.in march 2015, obama declared that he had authorized u.s. forces to provide logistical and intelligence support to the saudis in their military intervention in yemen, establishing a ""joint planning cell"" with saudi arabia. in 2016, the obama administration proposed a series of arms deals with saudi arabia worth $1157, 2009, obama announced that combat operations in iraq would end within 18 months. his remarks were made to a group of marines preparing for deployment to afghanistan. obama said, ""let me say this as plainly as i can: by august 31, 2010, our combat mission in iraq will end."" the obama administration scheduled the withdrawal of combat troops to be completed by august 2010, decreasing troops levels from 142,000 while leaving a transitional force of about 50,000 in iraq until the end of 2011. on august 19, 2010, the last u.s. combat brigade exited iraq. remaining troops transitioned from combat operations to counter-terrorism and the training, equipping, and advising of iraqi security forces. on august 31, 2010, obama announced that the united states combat mission in iraq was over. on october 21, 2011 president obama announced that all u.s. troops would leave iraq in time to be ""home for the holidays"".in june 2014, following the capture of mosul by isis, obama sent 275 troops to provide support and security for u.s. personnel and the u.s. embassy in baghdad. isis continued to gain ground and to commit widespread massacres and ethnic cleansing.in august 2014, during the sinjar massacre, obama ordered a campaign of u.s. airstrikes against isis.by the end of 2014, 3,100 american ground troops were committed to the conflict and 16,000 sorties were flown over the battlefield, primarily by u.s. air force and navy pilots.in early 2015, with the addition of the ""panther brigade"" of the 82nd airborne division the number of u.s. ground troops in iraq surged to 4,400, and by july american-led coalition air forces counted 44,000 sorties over the battlefield.early in his presidency, obama moved to bolster u.s. troop strength in afghanistan. he announced an increase in u.s. troop levels to 17,000 military personnel in february 2009 to ""stabilize a deteriorating situation in afghanistan"", an area he said had not received the ""strategic attention, direction and resources it urgently requires"". he replaced the military commander in afghanistan, general david d. mckiernan, with former special forces commander lt. gen. stanley a. mcchrystal in may 2009, indicating that mcchrystals special forces experience would facilitate the use of counterinsurgency tactics in the war. on december 1, 2009, obama announced the deployment of an additional 30,000 military personnel to afghanistan and proposed to begin troop withdrawals 18 months from that date; this took place in july 2011. david petraeus replaced mcchrystal in june 2010, after mcchrystals staff criticized white house personnel in a magazine article. in february 2013, obama said the u.s. military would reduce the troop level in afghanistan from 68,000 to 34,000 u.s. troops by february 2014.in october 2015, the white house announced a plan to keep u.s. forces in afghanistan indefinitely in light of the deteriorating security situation.in 2011, the united states vetoed a security council resolution condemning israeli settlements, with the united states being the only nation to do so. obama supports the two-state solution to the arab011, obama said the bond between the united states and israel is ""unbreakable"". during the initial years of the obama administration, the u.s. increased military cooperation with israel, including increased military aid, re-establishment of the u.s.-israeli joint political military group and the defense policy advisory group, and an increase in visits among high-level military officials of both countries. the obama administration asked congress to allocate money toward funding the iron dome program in response to the waves of palestinian rocket attacks on israel.in 2013, jeffrey goldberg reported that, in obamas view, ""with each new settlement announcement, netanyahu is moving his country down a path toward near-total isolation."" in 2014, obama likened the zionist movement to the civil rights movement in the united states. he said both movements seek to bring justice and equal rights to historically persecuted peoples. he explained, ""to me, being pro-israel and pro-jewish is part and parcel with the values that ive been fighting for since i was politically conscious and started getting involved in politics."" obama expressed support for israels right to defend itself during the 2014 israel015, obama was harshly criticized by israel for advocating and signing the iran nuclear deal; israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu, who had advocated the u.s. congress to oppose it, said the deal was ""dangerous"" and ""bad"".on december 23, 2016, under the obama administration, the united states abstained from united nations security council resolution 2334, which condemned israeli settlement building in the occupied palestinian territories as a violation of international law, effectively allowing it to pass. netanyahu strongly criticized the obama administrations actions, and the israeli government withdrew its annual dues from the organization, which totaled $6017. on january 5, 2017, the united states house of representatives voted 342011, protests in libya began against long-time dictator muammar gaddafi as part of the arab spring. they soon turned violent. in

u.s. senate. in response to the unanimous passage of united nations security council resolution 1973 on march 17, gaddafi spirits, and fighter jets. six days later, on march 25, by unanimous vote of all its 28 members, nato took over leadership of the effort, dubbed operation unified protector. some representatives questioned whether obama had the constitutional authority to order military action in addition to questioning its cost, structure and aftermath.on august 18, 2011, several months after the start of the syrian civil war, obama issued a written statement that said: ""the time has come for president assad to step aside."" this stance was reaffirmed in november 2015. in 2012, obama authorized multiple programs run by the cia and the pentagon to train anti-assad rebels. the pentagon-run program was later found to have failed and was formally abandoned in october 2015.in the wake of a chemical weapons attack in syria, formally blamed by the obama administration on the assad government, obama chose not to enforce the ""red line"" he had pledged and, rather than authorize the promised military action against assad, went along with the russia-brokered deal that led to assad giving up chemical weapons; however attacks with chlorine gas continued. in 2014, obama authorized an air campaign aimed primarily at isil.starting with information received from central intelligence agency operatives in july 2010, the cia developed intelligence over the next several months that determined what they believed to be the hideout of osama bin laden. he was living in seclusion in a large compound in abbottabad, pakistan, a suburban area 35 miles  cia head leon panetta reported this intelligence to president obama in march 2011. meeting with his national security advisers over the course of the next six weeks, obama rejected a plan to bomb the compound, and authorized a ""surgical raid"" to be conducted by united states navy seals. the operation took place on may 1, 2011, and resulted in the shooting death of bin laden and the seizure of papers, computer drives and disks from the compound. dna testing was one of five methods used to positively identify bin ladens corpse, which was buried at sea several hours later. within minutes of the presidents announcement from washington, dc, late in the evening on may 1, there were spontaneous celebrations around the country as crowds gathered outside the white house, and at new york citys ground zero and times square. reaction to the announcement was positive across party lines, including from former presidents bill clinton and george w. bush.on october 1, 2009, the obama administration went ahead with a bush administration program, increasing nuclear weapons production. the ""complex modernization"" initiative expanded two existing nuclear sites to produce new bomb parts. the administration built new plutonium pits at the los alamos lab in new mexico and expanded enriched uranium processing at the y-12 facility in oak ridge, tennessee. in november 2013, the obama administration opened negotiations with iran to prevent it from acquiring nuclear weapons, which included an interim agreement. negotiations took two years with numerous delays, with a deal being announced on july 14, 2015. the deal titled the ""joint comprehensive plan of action"" saw sanctions removed in exchange for measures that would prevent iran from producing nuclear weapons. while obama hailed the agreement as being a step towards a more hopeful world, the deal drew strong criticism from republican and conservative quarters, and from israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu. in addition, the transfer of $1.7015, obama started a $348013, secret meetings were conducted between the united states and cuba in the neutral locations of canada and vatican city. the vatican first became involved in 2013 when pope francis advised the u.s. and cuba to exchange prisoners as a gesture of goodwill. on december 10, 2013, cuban president ra014, after the secret meetings, it was announced that obama, with pope francis as an intermediary, had negotiated a restoration of relations with cuba, after nearly sixty years of d015, president obama announced that formal diplomatic relations between cuba and the united states would resume, and embassies would be opened in washington and havana. the countries respective ""interests sections"" in one anothers capitals were upgraded to embassies on july 20 and august 13, 2015, respectively.obama visited havana, cuba for two days in march 2016, becoming the first sitting u.s. president to arrive since calvin coolidge in 1928.obama spoke in front of the african union in addis ababa, ethiopia, on july 29, 2015, the first sitting u.s. president to do so. he gave a speech encouraging the world to increase economic ties via investments and trade with the continent, and lauded the progress made in education, infrastructure, and economy. he also criticized the lack of democracy and leaders who refuse to step aside, discrimination against minorities  during his july 2015 trip, obama also was the first u.s. president ever to visit kenya, which is the homeland of his father.on may 27, 2016, obama became the first sitting american president to visit hiroshima, japan, 71 years after the u.s. atomic bombing of hiroshima that ended world war ii. accompanied by japanese prime minister shinz014, military intervention in syria in 2015, and the interference in the 2016 u.s. presidential election, obamas russia policy was widely seen as a failure. george robertson, a former uk defense secretary and nato secretary-general, said obama had ""allowed putin to jump back on the world stage and test the resolve of the west"", adding that the legacy of this disaster would last.obamas family history, upbringing, and ivy league education differ markedly from those of african-american politicians who launched their careers in the 1960s through participation in the civil rights movement. expressing puzzlement over questions about whether he is ""black enough"", obama told an august 2007 meeting of the national association of black journalists that ""were still locked in this notion that if you appeal to white folks then there must be something wrong."" obama acknowledged his youthful image in an october 2007 campaign speech, saying: ""i wouldnt be here if, time and again, the torch had not been passed to a new generation.""obama is frequently referred to as an exceptional orator. during his pre-inauguration transition period and continuing into his presidency, obama delivered a series of weekly internet video addresses. in his speeches as president, obama did not make more overt references to race relations than his predecessors, but according to one study, he implemented stronger policy action on behalf of african-americans than any president since the nixon era.according to the gallup organization, obama began his presidency with a 68% approval rating before gradually declining for the rest of the year, and eventually bottoming out at 41% in august 2010, a trend similar to ronald reagans and bill clintons first years in office. he experienced a small poll bounce shortly after the death of osama bin laden on may 2, 2011. this bounce lasted until around june 2011, when his approval numbers dropped back to where they were previously. his approval ratings rebounded around the same time as his reelection in 2012, with polls showing an average job approval of 52% shortly after his second inauguration. despite approval ratings dropping to 39% in late-2013 due to the aca roll-out, they climbed to 50% in january 2015 according to gallup.polls showed strong support for obama in other countries both before and during his presidency. in a february 2009 poll conducted in western europe and the u.s. by harris interactive for france 24 and the international herald tribune, obama was rated as the most respected world leader, as well as the most powerful. in a similar poll conducted by harris in may 2009, obama was rated as the most popular world leader, as well as the one figure most people would pin their hopes on for pulling the world out of the economic downturn.obama won best spoken word album grammy awards for abridged audiobook versions of dreams from my father in february 2006 and for the audacity of hope in february 2008. his concession speech after the new hampshire primary was set to music by independent artists as the music video ""yes we

united states to address both houses of the uk parliament in westminster hall, london. this was only the fifth occurrence since the start of the 20th century of a head of states being extended this invitation, following charles de gaulle in 1960, nelson mandela in 1996, queen elizabeth ii in 2002 and pope benedict xvi in 2010.on october 9, 2009, the norwegian nobel committee announced that obama had won the 2009 nobel peace prize ""for his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples"". obama accepted this award in oslo, norway on december 10, 2009, with ""deep gratitude and great humility"". the award drew a mixture of praise and criticism from world leaders and media figures. obamas peace prize was called a ""stunning surprise"" by the new york times. some neoconservatives praised his speech for what they viewed as pro-american content. he became the fourth u.s. president to be awarded the nobel peace prize and the third to become a nobel laureate while in office. obamas nobel prize has been viewed skeptically in subsequent years, especially after the director of the nobel institute, geir lundestad, said obamas peace prize did not have the desired effect.obamas presidency ended at noon on january 20, 2017, immediately following the inauguration of his republican successor, donald trump. after the inauguration, obama lifted

administration joins a small handful of nations that reject the future; im confident that our states, cities, and businesses will step up and do even more to lead the way, and help protect for future generations the one planet weve got.""after senate republicans revealed the better care reconciliation act of 2017, their discussion draft of a health care bill to replace the affordable care act, on june 22, obama released a facebook post calling the bill ""a massive transfer of wealth from middle-class and poor families to the richest people in america"". on september 19, while delivering the

"learning disability, learning disorder, or learning difficulty while learning disability, learning disorder and learning difficulty are often used interchangeably, they differ in many ways. disorder refers to significant learning problems in an academic area. these problems, however, are not enough to warrant an official diagnosis. learning disability, on the other hand, is an official clinical diagnosis, whereby the individual meets certain criteria, as determined by a professional  types of learning disorders include reading the unknown factor is the disorder that affects the brains ability to receive and process information. this disorder can make it problematic for a person to learn as quickly or in the same way as someone who is not affected by a learning disability. people with a learning disability have trouble performing specific types of skills or completing tasks if left to figure things out by themselves or if taught in conventional ways.individuals with learning disabilities can face unique challenges that are often pervasive throughout the lifespan. depending on the type and severity of the disability, interventions, and current technologies may be used to help the individual learn strategies that will foster future success. some interventions can be quite simplistic, while others are intricate and complex. current technologies may require student training to be effective classroom supports. teachers, parents, and schools can create plans together that tailor intervention and accommodations to aid the individuals in successfully becoming independent learners. a multi-disciplinary team frequently helps to design the intervention and to coordinate the execution of the intervention with teachers and parents. this team frequently includes school psychologists, special educators, speech therapists representatives of organizations committed to the education and welfare of individuals with learning disabilities are known as national joint committee on learning disabilities  the njcld used the term learning disability to indicate a discrepancy between a childs apparent capacity to learn and his or her level of achievement. several difficulties existed, however, with the njcld standard of defining learning disability. one such difficulty was its belief of central nervous system dysfunction as a basis of understanding and diagnosing learning disability. this conflicted with the fact that many individuals who experienced central nervous system dysfunction, such as those with cerebral palsy, did not experience disabilities in learning. on the other hand, those individuals who experienced multiple handicapping conditions along with learning disability frequently received inappropriate assessment, planning, and instruction. the njcld notes that it is possible for learning disability to occur simultaneously with other handicapping conditions, however, the two should not be directly linked together or confused.in the 1980s, njcld, therefore, defined the term learning disability as: a heterogeneous group of disorders manifested by significant difficulties in the acquisition and use of listening, speaking, reading, writing, reasoning or mathematical abilities. these disorders are intrinsic to the individual and presumed to be due to central nervous system dysfunction. even though a learning disability may occur concomitantly with other handicapping conditions the issue of defining learning disabilities has generated significant and ongoing controversy. the term ""learning disability"" does not exist in dsm-iv, but it has been added to the dsm-5. the dsm-5 does not limit learning disorders to a particular diagnosis such as reading, mathematics, or written expression. instead, it is a single diagnosis criterion describing drawbacks in general academic skills and includes detailed specifiers for the areas of reading, mathematics, and written expression.in the united states and canada, the terms learning disability and learning disorder the section 504 of the rehabilitation act 1973, effective may 1977, guarantees certain rights to people with disabilities, especially in the cases of education and work, such being in schools, colleges and university settings.the individuals with disabilities education act, formerly known as the education for all handicapped children act, is a united states federal law that governs how states and public agencies provide early intervention, special education and related services to children with disabilities. it addresses the educational needs of children with disabilities from birth to the age of 21. considered as a civil rights law, states are not required to participate.in canada, the first association in support of children with learning disabilities was founded in 1962 by a group of concerned parents. originally called the association for children with learning disabilities, the learning disabilities association of canada 001, the enrichment project for the support system for students with learning disabilities was established. since then, there have been significant efforts to screen children for learning disabilities, provide follow-up support, and provide networking between schools and specialists.the effects of having a learning disability or learning difference are not limited to educational outcomes: individuals with learning disabilities may experience social problems as well. neuropsychological differences can affect the accurate perception of social cues with peers. researchers argue persons with learning disabilities not only experience negative effects as a result of their learning distinctions, but also as a result of carrying a stigmatizing label. it has generally been difficult to determine the efficacy of special education services because of data and methodological limitations. emerging research suggests adolescents with learning disabilities experience poorer academic outcomes even compared to peers who began high school with similar levels of achievement and comparable behaviors. it seems their poorer outcomes may be at least partially due to the lower expectations of their teachers; national data show teachers hold expectations for students labeled with learning disabilities that are inconsistent with their academic potential  it has been said that there is a strong connection between children with a learning disability and their educational performance.many studies have been done to assess the correlation between learning disability and self-esteem. these studies have shown that an individuals self-esteem is indeed affected by his or her awareness of their learning disability. students with a positive perception of their academic abilities generally tend to have higher self-esteem than those who do not, regardless of their actual academic achievement. however, studies have also shown that several other factors can influence self-esteem. skills in non-academic areas, such as athletics and arts, improve self-esteem. also, a positive perception of ones physical appearance has also been shown to have positive effects of self-esteem. another important finding is that students with learning disabilities are able to distinguish between academic skill and intellectual capacity. this demonstrates that students who acknowledge their academic limitations but are also aware of their potential to succeed in other intellectual tasks see themselves as intellectually competent individuals, which increases their self-esteem.research involving individuals with learning disabilities who exhibit challenging behaviors who are subsequently treated with antipsychotic medications provides little evidence that any benefits outweigh the risk.the causes for learning disabilities are not well understood, and sometimes there is no apparent cause for a learning disability. however, some causes of neurological impairments include:learning disabilities can be identified by psychiatrists, speech language pathologists, school psychologists, clinical psychologists, counseling psychologists, neuropsychologists, speech language pathologists, and other learning disability specialists through a combination of intelligence testing, academic achievement testing, classroom performance, and social interaction and aptitude. other areas of assessment may include perception, cognition, memory, attention, and language abilities. the resulting information is used to determine whether a childs academic performance is commensurate with his or her cognitive ability. if a childs cognitive ability is much higher than his or her academic performance, the student is often diagnosed with a learning disability. the dsm-iv and many school systems and government programs diagnose learning disabilities in this way  recent research has provided little evidence that a discrepancy between formally measured iq and achievement is a clear indicator of ld. furthermore, diagnosing on the basis of a discrepancy does not predict the effectiveness of treatment. low academic achievers who do not have a discrepancy with iq much current research has focused on a treatment-oriented diagnostic process known as response to intervention  those who respond will not require further intervention. those who do not respond adequately to regular classroom instruction  this may enable more children to receive assistance before experiencing significant failure, which may, in turn, result in fewer children who need intensive and expensive special education services. in the united states, the 2004 reauthorization of the individuals with disabilities education act permitted states and school districts to use rti as a method of identifying students with learning disabilities. rti is now the primary means of identification of learning disabilities in florida.the process does not take into account childrens individual neuropsychological factors such as phonological awareness and memory, that can inform design instruction. by not taking into account specific cognitive processes, rti fails to inform educators about a students relative strengths and weaknesses second, rti by design takes considerably longer than established techniques, often many months to find an appropriate tier of intervention. third, it requires a strong intervention program before students can be identified with a learning disability. lastly, rti is considered a regular education initiative and consists of members of general education teachers, in conjunction with other qualified professionals. occupational therapists demographers in the united states report that there has been a significant increase in immigrant children in the united states over the past two decades. this information is vital because it has been and will continue to affect both students and how educators approach teaching methods. various teaching strategies are more successful for students that are linguistic or culturally diverse versus traditional methods of teaching used for students whose first language is english. it is then also true that the proper way to diagnose a learning disability in english language learners currently, there are no standardized guidelines for the process of diagnosing english language learners  linguistically responsive psychologist understand that second language acquisition is a process and they understand how to support ells growth in language and academically. when ells are referred for a psychoeducational assessment, it is difficult to isolate and disentangle what are the effects of the language acquisition process, from poor quality educational services, from what may be academic difficulties that result from processing disorders, attention problems, and learning disabilities. additionally not having trained staff and faculty becomes more of an issue when staff is unaware of numerous types of psychological factors that immigrant children in the u.s dealing could be potentially dealing with. these factors that include acculturation, fear and/or worry of deportation, separation from social supports such as parents, language barriers, disruptions in learning experiences, stigmatization, economic challenge, and risk factors associated with poverty. in the united states, there are no set policies mandating that all districts employ bilingual school psychologist, nor are schools equipped with specific tools and resources to assist immigrant children and families. many school districts do not have the proper personnel that is able to communicate with this population.a well trained bilingual school psychologist will be able to administer and interpret assessment all psychological testing tool. also, an emphasis is placed on informal assessment measures such as language samples, observations, interviews, and rating scales as well as curriculum-based measurement to complement information gathered from formal assessments. a compilation of these tests is used to assess whether an ell student has a learning disability or merely is academically delayed because of language barriers or environmental factors. it is very unfortunate that many schools do not have school psychologist with the proper training nor access to appropriate tools. also, many school districts frown upon taking the appropriate steps to diagnosing ell students.many normed assessments can be used in evaluating skills in the primary academic domains: reading, including word recognition, fluency, and comprehension; mathematics, including computation and problem solving; and written expression, including handwriting, spelling and composition.the most commonly used comprehensive achievement tests include the woodcock-johnson iv in the reading domain, there are also specialized tests that can be used to obtain details about specific reading deficits. assessments that measure multiple domains of reading include grays diagnostic reading testsnd edition the purpose of assessment is to determine what is needed for intervention, which also requires consideration of contextual variables and whether there are comorbid disorders that must also be identified and treated, such as behavioral issues or language delays. these contextual variables are often assessed using parent and teacher questionnaire forms that rate the students behaviors and compares them to standardized norms.however, caution should be made when suspecting the person with a learning disability may also have dementia, especially as people with downs syndrome may have the neuroanatomical profile but not the associated clinical signs and symptoms. examination can be carried out of executive functioning as well as social and cognitive abilities but may need adaptation of standardized tests to take account of special needs.learning disabilities can be categorized by either the type of information processing affected by the disability or by the specific difficulties caused by a processing deficit.learning disabilities fall into broad categories based on the four stages of information processing used in learning: input, integration, storage, and output. many learning disabilities are a compilation of a few types of abnormalities occurring at the same time, as well as with social difficulties and emotional or behavioral disorders.deficits in any area of information processing can manifest in a variety of specific learning disabilities. it is possible for an individual to have more than one of these difficulties. this is referred to as comorbidity or co-occurrence of learning disabilities. in the uk, the term dual diagnosis is often used to refer to co-occurrence of learning difficulties.reading disorder is the most common learning disability. of all students with specific learning disabilities, 70\x80\x9d and lower class students as early as the 1960s. the distinction between race/ethnicity and ses is important to the extent that these considerations contribute to the provision of services to children in need.while many studies have considered only one characteristic of the student at a time, or used district- or school-level data to examine this issue, more recent studies have used large national student-level datasets and sophisticated methodology to find that the disproportionate identification of african american students with learning disabilities can be attributed to their average lower ses, while the disproportionate identification of latino youth seems to be attributable to difficulties in distinguishing between linguistic proficiency and learning ability. although the contributing factors are complicated and interrelated, it is possible to discern which factors really drive disproportionate identification by considering a multitude of student characteristics simultaneously. for instance, if high ses minorities have rates of identification that are similar to the rates among high ses whites, and low ses minorities have rates of identification that are similar to the rates among low ses whites, we can know that the seemingly higher rates of identification among minorities result from their greater likelihood to have low ses. summarily, because the risk of identification for white students who have low ses is similar to that of black students who have low ses, future research and policy reform should focus on identifying the shared qualities or experiences of low ses youth that lead to their disproportionate identification, rather than focusing exclusively on racial/ethnic minorities. it remains to be determined why lower ses youth are at higher risk of incidence, or possibly just of identification, with learning disabilities.people with an iq lower than 70 are usually characterized as having an intellectual disability and are not included under most definitions of learning disabilities because their difficulty in learning are considered to be related directly to their overall low intelligence.attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder people diagnosed with adhd sometimes have impaired learning. some of the struggles people with adhd have might include lack of motivation, high levels of anxiety, and the inability to process information. there are studies that suggest people with adhd generally have a positive attitude toward academics and, with developed study skills, can perform just as well as individuals without learning disabilities. also, using alternate sources of gathering information, such as websites, study groups, and learning centers, can help a person with adhd be academically successful.some research is beginning to make a case for adhd being included in the definition of lds since it is being shown to have a strong effect on ""executive functions"" required for learning. this has not as yet affected any official definitions. though, historically, adhd was not clearly distinguished from other disabilities related to learning. scientific research continues to explore the traits, struggles, and learning styles of those with adhd.",1,0
"hockey is a sport in which two teams play against each other by trying to manoeuvre a ball or a puck into the opponents goal using a hockey stick. there are many types of hockey such as bandy, field hockey, ice hockey and rink hockey.in most of the world, the term hockey by itself refers to field hockey, while in canada, the united states, russia and most of eastern and northern europe, the term usually refers to ice hockey.the first recorded use of the word hockey is in the 1773 book juvenile sports and pastimes, to which are prefixed, memoirs of the author: including a new mode of infant education by richard johnson  the belief that hockey was mentioned in a 1363 proclamation by king edward iii of england is based on modern translations of the proclamation, which was originally in latin and explicitly forbade the games ""pilam manualem, pedivam, & bacularem: & ad canibucam & gallorum pugnam"". the english historian and biographer john strype did not use the word ""hockey"" when he translated the proclamation in 1720, instead translating ""canibucam"" as ""cambuck""; this may have referred to either an early form of hockey or a game more similar to golf or croquet.the word hockey itself is of unknown origin. one supposition is that it is a derivative of hoquet, a middle french word for a shepherds stave. the curved, or ""hooked"" ends of the sticks used for hockey would indeed have resembled these staves. another supposition derives from the known use of cork bungs, games played with curved sticks and a ball can be found in the histories of many cultures. in egypt, 4000-year-old carvings feature teams with sticks and a projectile, hurling dates to before 1272 bc in ireland, and there is a depiction from approximately 600 bc in ancient greece, where the game may have been called ker7 banned certain types of ball games, including games using ""hooked"" ...at no tyme to use ne occupye the horlinge of the litill balle with hockie stickes or staves, nor use no hande ball to play withoute walles, but only greate foote balle by the 19th century, the various forms and divisions of historic games began to differentiate and coalesce into the individual sports defined today. organizations dedicated to the codification of rules and regulations began to form, and national and international bodies sprang up to manage domestic and international competition.bandy is played with a ball on a football pitch-sized ice arena  and spread from england to other european countries around 1900; a similar russian sport can also be seen as a predecessor and in russia, bandy is sometimes called ""russian hockey"". bandy world championships have been played since 1957 and womens bandy world championships since 2004. there are national club championships in many countries and the top clubs in the world play in the bandy world cup every year.field hockey is played on gravel, natural grass, or sand-based or water-based artificial turf, with a small, hard ball approximately 73012 that india has no national sport.ice hockey is played between two teams of skaters on a large flat area of ice, using a three-inch-diameter  and the national winter sport of canada. ice hockey is played at a number of levels, by all ages.the governing body of international play is the 77-member international ice hockey federation the contemporary sport developed in canada from european and native influences. these included various stick and ball games similar to field hockey, bandy and other games where two teams push a ball or object back and forth with sticks. these were played outdoors on ice under the name ""hockey"" in england throughout the 19th century, and even earlier under various other names. in canada, there are 24 reports of hockey-like games in the 19th century before 1875 ice sledge hockey or para ice hockey is a form of ice hockey designed for players with physical disabilities affecting their lower bodies. players sit on double-bladed sledges and use two sticks; each stick has a blade at one end and small picks at the other. players use the sticks to pass, stickhandle and shoot the puck, and to propel their sledges. the rules are very similar to iihf ice hockey rules.canada is a recognized international leader in the development of sledge hockey, and much of the equipment for the sport was first developed there, such as sledge hockey sticks laminated with fiberglass, as well as aluminum shafts with hand-carved insert blades and special aluminum sledges with regulation skate blades.based on ice sledge hockey, inline sledge hockey is played to the same rules as inline puck hockey  the first game of inline sledge hockey was played at bisley, england, on 19 december 2009 between the hull stingrays and the grimsby redwings. matt lloyd is credited with inventing inline sledge hockey, and great britain is seen as the international leader in the games development.inline hockey is a variation of roller hockey very similar to ice hockey, from which it is derived. inline hockey is played by two teams, consisting of four skaters and one goalie, on a dry rink divided into two halves by a center line, with one net at each end of the rink. the game is played in three 15-minute periods with a variation of the ice hockey off-side rule. icings are also called, but are usually referred to as illegal clearing. the governing body is the iihf, as for ice hockey, but some leagues and competitions do not follow the iihf regulations, in particular usa inline and canada inline.roller hockey, also known as quad hockey, international-style ball hockey, rink hockey and hoquei em patins, is an overarching name for a roller sport that has existed since long before inline skates were invented. this sport is played in over sixty countries and has a worldwide following. roller hockey was a demonstration sport at the 1992 barcelona summer olympics.also known as road hockey, this is a dry-land variant of ice and roller hockey played year-round on a hard surface (usually asphalt. a ball is usually used instead of a puck, and protective equipment is not usually worn.other games derived from hockey or its predecessors include the following:",1,0
"social services are a range of public services provided by the government, private, profit and non-profit organisations. these public services aim to create more effective organizations, build stronger communities, and promote equality and opportunity.social services include the benefits and facilities like education, food subsidies, health care, police, fire service, job training and subsidized housing, adoption, community management, policy research, and lobbying.",1,0
"dance is a performing art form consisting of purposefully selected sequences of human movement. this movement has aesthetic and symbolic value, and is acknowledged as dance by performers and observers within a particular culture. dance can be categorized and described by its choreography, by its repertoire of movements, or by its historical period or place of origin.an important distinction is to be drawn between the contexts of theatrical and participatory dance, although these two categories are not always completely separate; both may have special functions, whether social, ceremonial, competitive, erotic, martial, or sacred/liturgical. other forms of human movement are sometimes said to have a dance-like quality, including martial arts, gymnastics, cheerleading, figure skating, synchronised swimming, marching bands, and many other forms of athletics.theatrical dance, also called performance or concert dance, is intended primarily as a spectacle, usually a performance upon a stage by virtuoso dancers. it often tells a story, perhaps using mime, costume and scenery, or else it may simply interpret the musical accompaniment, which is often specially composed. examples are western ballet and modern dance, classical indian dance and chinese and japanese song and dance dramas. most classical forms are centred upon dance alone, but performance dance may also appear in opera and other forms of musical theatre.participatory dance, on the other hand, whether it be a folk dance, a social dance, a group dance such as a line, circle, chain or square dance, or a partner dance such as is common in western western ballroom dancing, is undertaken primarily for a common purpose, such as social interaction or exercise, of participants rather than onlookers. such dance seldom has any narrative. a group dance and a corps de ballet, a social partner dance and a pas de deux, differ profoundly. even a solo dance may be undertaken solely for the satisfaction of the dancer. participatory dancers often all employ the same movements and steps but, for example, in the rave culture of electronic dance music, vast crowds may engage in free dance, uncoordinated with those around them. on the other hand, some cultures lay down strict rules as to the particular dances in which, for example, men, women and children may or must participate.archeological evidence for early dance includes 9,000-year-old paintings in india at the rock shelters of bhimbetka, and egyptian tomb paintings depicting dancing figures, dated c. 3300 bc. it has been proposed that before the invention of written languages, dance was an important part of the oral and performance methods of passing stories down from one generation to the next. the use of dance in ecstatic trance states and healing rituals references to dance can be found in very early recorded history; greek dance  the bible and talmud refer to many events related to dance, and contain over 30 different dance terms. in chinese pottery as early as the neolithic period, groups of people are depicted dancing in a line holding hands, and the earliest chinese word for ""dance"" is found written in the oracle bones. dance is further described in the l and 3 part inventions, adams violin concerto and andantino. similarly, poems are often structured and named after dances or musical works, while dance and music have both drawn their conception of ""measure"" or ""metre"" from poetry.shawn quotes with approval the statement of dalcroze that, while the art of musical rhythm consists in differentiating and combining time durations, pauses and accents ""according to physiological law"", that of ""plastic rhythm"" the early-20th-century american dancer helen moller stated simply that ""it is rhythm and form more than harmony and color which, from the beginning, has bound music, poetry and dancing together in a union that is indissoluble.""concert dance, like opera, generally depends for its large-scale form upon a narrative dramatic structure. the movements and gestures of the choreography are primarily intended to mime the personality and aims of the characters and their part in the plot. such theatrical requirements tend towards longer, freer movements than those usual in non-narrative dance styles. on the other hand, the ballet blanc, developed in the 19th century, allows interludes of rhythmic dance that developed into entirely ""plotless"" ballets in the 20th century and that allowed fast, rhythmic dance-steps such as those of the petit allegro. a well-known example is the cygnets dance in act two of swan lake.the ballet developed out of courtly dramatic productions of 16th- and 17th-century france and italy and for some time dancers performed dances developed from those familiar from the musical suite, all of which were defined by definite rhythms closely identified with each dance. these appeared as character dances in the era of romantic nationalism.ballet reached widespread vogue in the romantic era, accompanied by a larger orchestra and grander musical conceptions that did not lend themselves easily to rhythmic clarity and by dance that emphasised dramatic mime. a broader concept of rhythm was needed, that which rudolf laban terms the ""rhythm and shape"" of movement that communicates character, emotion and intention, while only certain scenes required the exact synchronisation of step and music essential to other dance styles, so that, to laban, modern europeans seemed totally unable to grasp the meaning of ""primitive rhythmic movements"", a situation that began to change in the 20th century with such productions as igor stravinskys the rite of spring with its new rhythmic language evoking primal feelings of a primitive past.indian classical dance styles, like ballet, are often in dramatic form, so that there is a similar complementarity between narrative expression and ""pure"" dance. in this case, however, the two are separately defined, though not always separately performed. the rhythmic elements, which are abstract and technical, are known as nritta. both this and expressive dance  somewhat similarly, noh distinguishes between geki noh, based around the advancement of plot and the narration of action, and fury0th century concert dance brought an explosion of innovation in dance style characterized by an exploration of freer technique. early pioneers of what became known as modern dance include loie fuller, isadora duncan, mary wigman and ruth st. denis. the relationship of music to dance serves as the basis for eurhythmics, devised by emile jaques-dalcroze, which was influential to the development of modern dance and modern ballet through artists such as marie rambert. eurythmy, developed by rudolf steiner and marie steiner-von sivers, combines formal elements reminiscent of traditional dance with the new freer style, and introduced a complex new vocabulary to dance. in the 1920s, important founders of the new style such as martha graham and doris humphrey began their work. since this time, a wide variety of dance styles have been developed; see modern dance.african american dance developed in everyday spaces, rather than in dance studios, schools or companies. tap dance, disco, jazz dance, swing dance, hip hop dance, the lindy hop with its relationship to rock and roll music and rock and roll dance have had a global influence. dance styles fusing classical ballet technique with african-american dance have also appeared in the 21st century, including hiplet.dance is central to latin american social life and culture. brazilian samba, argentinian tango, and cuban salsa are internationally popular partner dances, and other national dances0th century dance that would go on to influence swing, jive, and jazz dancelatin ballroom dancers perform the tangogumboot dance evolved from the stomping signals used as coded communication between labourers in south african minesharlequin and columbina from the mime theater in copenhagen, denmarka hip-hop dancer demonstrates poppingerotic dance 017kebagh dance from pagar alam, indonesia",1,0
"the university of california, los angeles  is a public research university in los angeles, california. ucla traces its early origins back to 1882 as the southern branch of the california state normal school  enrolling about 31,500 undergraduate and 12,800 graduate students. ucla had 119,000 applicants for fall 2016, including transfer applicants, making the school the most applied-to of any american university.the university is organized into six undergraduate colleges, seven professional schools, and four professional health science schools. the undergraduate colleges are the college of letters and science; samueli school of engineering; school of the arts and architecture; herb alpert school of music; school of theater, film and television; and school of nursing.ucla has been called a public ivy, and has been ranked among the best public universities in the united states by major college and university rankings. this includes one ranking that has ucla as the top public university in the united states in 2021. as of october020, 25 nobel laureates, three fields medalists, and five turing award winners, and two chief scientists of the u.s. air force have been affiliated with ucla as faculty, researchers, or alumni. among the current faculty members, 55 have been elected to the national academy of sciences, 28 to the national academy of engineering, 39 to the institute of medicine, and 124 to the american academy of arts and sciences. the university was elected to the association of american universities in 1974.ucla student-athletes compete as the bruins in the pac-12 conference. the bruins have won 129 national championships, including 118 ncaa team championships, more than any other university except stanford university, whose athletes have won 126. ucla students, coaches, and staff have won 251 olympic medals: 126 gold, 65 silver, and 60 bronze. ucla student-athletes have competed in every olympics since 1920 with one exception in march 1881, at the request of state senator reginaldo francisco del valle, the california state legislature authorized the creation of a southern branch of the california state normal school in 1914, the school moved to a new campus on vermont avenue  the southern branch campus opened on september 15 of that year, offering two-year undergraduate programs to 250 letters and science students and 1,250 students in the teachers college, under moores continued direction.under university of california president william wallace campbell, enrollment at the southern branch expanded so rapidly that by the mid-1920s the institution was outgrowing the 251, 1925, edging out the panoramic hills of the still-empty palos verdes peninsula. after the athletic teams entered the pacific coast conference in 1926, the southern branch student council adopted the nickname ""bruins"", a name offered by the student council at uc berkeley. in 1927, the regents renamed the southern branch the university of california at los angeles  in the same year, the state broke ground in westwood on land sold for $1 million, less than one-third its value, by real estate developers edwin and harold janss, for whom the janss steps are named. the campus in westwood opened to students in 1929.the original four buildings were the college library during its first 32 years, ucla was treated as an off-site department of uc. as such, its presiding officer was called a ""provost"", and reported to the main campus in berkeley. in 1951, ucla was formally elevated to co-equal status with uc berkeley, and its presiding officer raymond b. allen was the first chief executive to be granted the title of chancellor. the appointment of franklin david murphy to the position of chancellor in 1960 helped spark an era of tremendous growth of facilities and faculty honors. by the end of the decade, ucla had achieved distinction in a wide range of subjects. this era also secured uclas position as a proper university and not simply a branch of the uc system. this change is exemplified by an incident involving chancellor murphy, which was described by him:i picked up the telephone and called in from somewhere, and the phone operator said, ""university of california."" and i said, ""is this berkeley?"" she said, ""no."" i said, ""well, who have i gotten to?"" ""ucla."" i said, ""why didnt you say ucla?"" ""oh"", she said, ""were instructed to say university of california."" so the next morning i went to the office and wrote a memo; i said, ""will you please instruct the operators, as of noon today, when they answer the phone to say, ucla."" and they said, ""you know they wont like it at berkeley."" and i said, ""well, lets just see. there are a few things maybe we can do around here without getting their permission.""on june 1, 2016, two men were killed in a murder-suicide at an engineering building in the university. school officials put the campus on lockdown as los angeles police department officers, including swat, cleared the campus.in 2018, a student-led community coalition known as ""westwood forward"" successfully led an effort to break ucla and westwood village away from the existing westwood neighborhood council and form a new north westwood neighborhood council, with over 2,000 out of 3,521 stakeholders voting in favor of the split. westwood forwards campaign focused on making housing more affordable and encouraging nightlife in westwood by opposing many of the restrictions on housing developments and restaurants the westwood neighborhood council had promoted.in 2014, a graduate student adviser and professor in the history department, gabriel piterberg, was accused of sexually assaulting two students. a lawsuit was filed against the university by sexual harassment attorney ann olivarius for its failure to properly act on the accusations. an editorial in the student newspaper wrote about the universitys response, ""this outcome is an embarrassment for ucla. not only does this represent a huge step backward and a betrayal of students015, the u.s. department of educations office for civil rights investigated ucla and other universities for their compliance with title ix and responses to sexual violence.in 2018, the university came into the national spotlight again when the los angeles times reported that four ucla employees had filed lawsuits against ucla and the uc board of regents having accused their workplace supervisor of sexual harassment and the university of failing to properly handle abuse complaints. the harassment allegedly started in early 2016, according to the lawsuits. the women faced retaliation from other supervisors after they filed complaints. the retaliatory behavior included making the women do more work and not allowing them to take time off to see their attorney. they are seeking more than $120 million in damages.subsequently, an audit by the california state auditor found inconsistent discipline in ucla sexual misconduct cases. the state audit also found that ucla did not follow university policy or title ix requirements.ucla was one of several universities named in the largest college admissions scandal ever prosecuted by the united states department of justice. on tuesday, march 12, 2019, ucla mens soccer coach jorge salcedo was one of many coaches across the country charged with racketeering and conspiracy, and is alleged to have taken over $200,000 in bribes.the new ucla campus in 1929 had four buildings: royce hall and haines hall on the north, and powell library and kinsey hall  the campus is approximately 1 mile east of the i-405 san diego freeway.the campus is in the residential area of westwood and bordered by bel-air to the north, beverly hills to the east, and brentwood to the west. the campus is informally divided into north campus and south campus, which are both on the eastern half of the universitys land. north campus is the original campus core; its buildings are more traditional in appearance and clad in imported italian brick. north campus is home to the arts, humanities, social sciences, law, history, and business programs and is centered around ficus and sycamore-lined dickson court, also known as the ""sunken garden"". south campus is home to the physical sciences, life sciences, engineering, mathematical sciences, health-related fields, and the ucla medical center. the campus includes sculpture gardens, fountains, museums, and a mix of architectural styles.ackerman union, the john wooden center, the arthur ashe health and wellness center, the student activities center, kerckhoff hall, the j.d. morgan center, the james west alumni center, and pauley pavilion stand at the center of the campus, bordering wilson plaza. the campus is bisected by bruin walk, a heavily traveled pathway from the residential hill to the main campus. at the intersection of bruin walk and westwood plaza is bruin plaza, featuring an outdoor performing arts stage and a bronze statue of the bruin bear.during the 2028 summer olympics, wrestling and judo will be held at pauley pavilion. the campus will also be the location of the olympic village for the olympic and paralympic games.the first buildings were designed by the local firm allison & allison. the romanesque revival style of these first four structures remained the predominant building style until the 1950s, when architect welton becket was hired to supervise the expansion of the campus over the next two decades. becket greatly streamlined itsgeneral appearance, adding several rows of minimalist, slab0th century. more recent additions include buildings designed by architects i.m. pei, venturi, scott brown and associates, richard meier, cesar pelli, and rafael vinoly. to accommodate uclas rapidly growing student population, multiple construction and renovation projects are in progress, including expansions of the life sciences and engineering research complexes. this continuous construction gives ucla the nickname ""under construction like always"".one notable building on campus is named after african-american alumnus ralph bunche, who received the 1950 nobel peace prize for negotiating an armistice agreement between the jews and arabs in israel. the entrance of bunche hall features a bust of him overlooking the franklin d. murphy sculpture garden. he was the first individual of non-european background and the first ucla alumnus to be honored with the prize.the hannah carter japanese garden is located a mile north of campus, in the community of bel air. the garden was designed by landscape architect nagao sakurai of tokyo and garden designer kazuo nakamura of kyoto in 1959. the garden was donated to ucla by former uc regent and ucla alumnus edward w. carter and his wife hannah carter in 1964 with the stipulation that it remains open to the public. after the garden was damaged by heavy rains in 1969, ucla professor of art and campus architect koichi kawana took on the task of its reconstruction. the property was sold in 2016 and public access is no longer required.ucla has attracted filmmakers for decades with its proximity to hollywood. much of the film gotcha! in response to the major demand for filming, ucla has instated a policy to regulate filming and professional photography at the campus.""ucla is located in los angeles, the same place as the american motion picture industry"", said ucla visiting professor of film and television jonathan kuntz.

"coordinates: 36888south korea south korea is a highly developed country, ranking as the third-highest country on the human development index in asia. it is a member of the oecds development assistance committee, the g20 and the paris club. its economy ranks as the worlds tenth-largest by nominal gdp. its citizens enjoy one of the worlds fastest internet connection speeds. the country is the worlds fifth-largest exporter and eighth-largest importer. south korea was in 2017 the worlds 7th largest emitter of carbon emissions and the 5th largest emitter per capita. since the 21st century, south korea has been renowned for its influential pop culture, particularly in music the name korea derives from the name goryeo. the name goryeo itself was first used by the ancient kingdom of goguryeo, which was considered a great power of east asia during its time, in the 5th century as a shortened form of its name. the 10th-century kingdom of goryeo succeeded goguryeo, and thus inherited its name, which was pronounced by the visiting persian merchants as ""korea"". the modern name of koreia, appears in the first portuguese maps of 1568 by jo, joseon became the official name for the entire territory, though it was not universally accepted. the new official name has its origin in the ancient kingdom of gojoseon  however, the name joseon was still widely used by koreans to refer to their country, though it was no longer the official name. under japanese rule, the two names han and joseon coexisted. there were several groups who fought for independence, the most notable being the provisional government of the republic of korea  as a result, the korean name ""daehan minguk"" is sometimes used by south koreans as a metonym to refer to the korean ethnicity since the government only controlled the southern part of the korean peninsula, the informal term south korea was coined, becoming increasingly common in the western world. while south koreans use han  the history of korea begins with the founding of joseon  gojoseon was noted in chinese records in the early 7th century. gojoseon expanded until it controlled the northern korean peninsula and parts of manchuria. gija joseon was purportedly founded in the 12th century bce, but its existence and role have been controversial in the modern era. in 108 bce, the han dynasty defeated wiman joseon and installed four commanderies in the northern korean peninsula. three of the commanderies fell or retreated westward within a few decades. as lelang commandery was destroyed and rebuilt around this time, the place gradually moved toward liaodong. thus,6, and a decade later the last crown prince of balhae fled south to goryeo, where he was warmly welcomed and included into the ruling family by wang geon, thus unifying the two successor nations of goguryeo. like silla, goryeo was a highly cultural state, and invented the metal movable type printing press. after defeating the khitan empire, which was the most powerful empire of its time, in the goryeo universities that produced famous scholars and scientists. however, the mongol invasions in the 13th century greatly weakened the kingdom. goryeo was never conquered by the mongols, but exhausted after three decades of fighting, the korean court sent its crown prince to the yuan capital to swear allegiance to kublai khan, who accepted, and married one of his daughters to the korean crown prince. henceforth, goryeo continued to rule korea, though as a tributary ally to the mongols for the next 86 years. during this period, the two nations became intertwined as all subsequent korean kings married mongol princesses, and the last empress of the yuan dynasty was a korean princess. in the mid-14th century, goryeo drove out the mongols to regain its northern territories, briefly conquered liaoyang, and defeated invasions by the red turbans. however, in 1392, general yi seong-gye, who had been ordered to attack china, turned his army around and staged a coup.yi seong-gye declared the new name of korea as ""joseon"" in reference to gojoseon, and moved the capital to hanseong  the first 200 years of the joseon dynasty were marked by peace, and saw great advancements in science and education, as well as the creation of hangul by sejong the great to promote literacy among the common people. the prevailing ideology of the time was neo-confucianism, which was epitomized by the seonbi class: nobles who passed up positions of wealth and power to lead lives of study and integrity. between 1592 and 1598, toyotomi hideyoshi launched invasions of korea, but his advance was halted by korean forces  with assistance from righteous army militias formed by korean civilians, and ming dynasty chinese troops. through a series of successful battles of attrition, the japanese forces were eventually forced to withdraw, and relations between all parties became normalized. however, the manchus took advantage of joseons war-weakened state and invaded in 1627 and 1637, and then went on to conquer the destabilized ming dynasty. after normalizing relations with the new qing dynasty, joseon experienced a nearly 200-year period of peace. kings yeongjo and jeongjo particularly led a new renaissance of the joseon dynasty during the 18th century. in the 19th century, the royal in-law families gained control of the government, leading to mass corruption and weakening of the state, and severe poverty and peasant rebellions throughout the country. furthermore, the joseon government adopted a strict isolationist policy, earning the nickname ""the hermit kingdom"", but ultimately failed to protect itself against imperialism and was forced to open its borders. after the first sino-japanese war and the russo-japanese war, korea was occupied by japan  both leaders began an authoritarian repression of their political opponents inside their region, seeking for a unification of korea under their control. while south koreas request for military support was denied by the united states, north koreas military was heavily reinforced by the soviet union.on june 25, 1950, north korea invaded south korea, sparking the korean war, the cold wars first major conflict, which continued until 1953. at the time, the soviet union had boycotted the united nations the 1953 armistice, never signed by south korea, split the peninsula along the demilitarized zone near the original demarcation line. no peace treaty was ever signed, resulting in the two countries remaining technically at war. approximately 3 million people died in the korean war, with a higher proportional civilian death toll than world war ii or the vietnam war, making it perhaps the deadliest conflict of the cold war-era. in addition, virtually all of koreas major cities were destroyed by the war.in 1960, a student uprising chun subsequently created the national defense emergency policy committee and took the presidency according to his political plan. chun and his government held south korea under a despotic rule until 1987, when a seoul national university student, park jong-chul, was tortured to death. on june 10, the catholic priests association for justice revealed the incident, igniting the june democracy movement around the country. eventually, chuns party, the democratic justice party, and its leader, roh tae-woo announced the 6.29 declaration, which included the direct election of the president. roh went on to win the election by a narrow margin against the two main opposition leaders, kim dae-jung and kim young-sam. seoul hosted the olympic games in 1988, widely regarded as successful and a significant boost for south koreas global image and economy.south korea was formally invited to become a member of the united nations in 1991. the transition of korea from autocracy to modern democracy was marked in 1997 by the election of kim dae-jung, who was sworn in as the eighth president of south korea, on february 25, 1998. his election was significant given that he had in earlier years been a political prisoner sentenced to death in june 2000, as part of president kim dae-jungs ""sunshine policy"" of engagement, a north007 led by president lee myung-bak, former mayor of seoul. meanwhile, south korea and japan jointly co-hosted the 2002 fifa world cup. however, south korean and japanese relations later soured because of conflicting claims of sovereignty over the liancourt rocks.in 2010, there was an escalation in attacks by north korea. in march 2010 the south korean warship roks cheonan was sunk with the loss of 46 south korean sailors, allegedly by a north korean submarine. in november 2010 yeonpyeong island was attacked by a significant north korean artillery barrage, with 4 people losing their lives. the lack of a strong response to these attacks from both south korea and the international community  south korea saw another milestone in 2012 with the first ever female president park geun-hye elected and assuming office. daughter of another former president, park chung-hee, she carried on a conservative brand of politics. president park geun-hyes administration was formally accused of corruption, bribery, and influence-peddling for the involvement of close friend choi soon-sil in state affairs. there followed a series of massive public demonstrations from november 2016 and she was removed from office. after the fallout of president parks impeachment and dismissal, new elections were held and moon jae-in of the democratic party won the presidency, assuming office on 10 may 2017. his tenure so far has seen an improving political relationship with north korea, some increasing divergence in the military alliance with the united states, and the successful hosting of the winter olympics in pyeongchang.south korea occupies the southern portion of the korean peninsula, which extends some 1,1000 national parks and popular nature places like the boseong tea fields, suncheon bay ecological park, and the first national park of jirisan.south korea tends to have a humid continental climate and a humid subtropical climate, and is affected by the east asian monsoon, with precipitation heavier in summer during a short rainy season called jangma  summer can be uncomfortably hot and humid, with temperatures exceeding 30012 to 2022.quota systems favor large, vertically integrated generators and multinational electric utilities, if only because certificates are generally denominated in units of one megawatt-hour. they are also more difficult to design and implement than a feed-in tariff. around 350 residential micro combined heat and power units were installed in 2012.south-korea was in 2017 the worlds 7th largest emitter of carbon emmsions and the 5th largest emitter per capita. the president moon jae-in pledged to reduce carbon emissions to zero in 2050.seouls tap water recently became safe to drink, with city officials branding it ""arisu"" in a bid to convince the public. efforts have also been made with afforestation projects. another multibillion-dollar project was the restoration of cheonggyecheon, a stream running through downtown seoul that had earlier been paved over by a motorway. one major challenge is air quality, with acid rain, sulfur oxides, and annual yellow dust storms being particular problems. it is acknowledged that many of these difficulties are a result of south koreas proximity to china, which is a major air polluter. south korea had a 2019 forest landscape integrity index mean score of 6.02/10, ranking it 87th globally out of 172 countries.south korea is a member of the antarctic-environmental protocol, antarctic treaty, biodiversity treaty, kyoto protocol  with mexico and switzerland, desertification, endangered species, environmental modification, hazardous wastes, law of the sea, marine dumping, comprehensive nuclear-test-ban treaty the south korean governments structure is determined by the constitution of the republic of korea. like many democratic states, south korea has a government divided into three branches: executive, judicial, and legislative. the executive and legislative branches operate primarily at the national level, although various ministries in the executive branch also carry out local functions. local governments are semi-autonomous, and contain executive and legislative bodies of their own. the judicial branch operates at both the national and local levels. south korea is a constitutional democracy.the constitution has been revised several times since its first promulgation in 1948 at independence. however, it has retained many broad characteristics and with the exception of the short-lived second republic of south korea, the country has always had a presidential system with an independent chief executive. under its current constitution the state is sometimes referred to as the sixth republic of south korea. the first direct election was also held in 1948.although south korea experienced a series of military dictatorships from the 1960s until the 1980s, it has since developed into a successful liberal democracy. today, the cia world factbook describes south koreas democracy as a ""fully functioning modern democracy"". south korea is ranked 45th on the corruption perceptions index the major administrative divisions in south korea are eight provinces, one special self-governing province, six metropolitan cities .in april 2016, south koreas population was estimated to be around 50.8 million by national statistical office, with continuing decline of working age population and total fertility rate. the country is noted for its population density, which was an estimated 505 per square kilometer in 2015, more than 10 times the global average. aside from micro-states and city-states, south korea is the worlds third most densely-populated country. in practice the population density in much of south korea is higher than the national one, as most of the countrys land is uninhabitable due to being used for other purposes such as farming. most south koreans live in urban areas, because of rapid migration from the countryside during the countrys quick economic expansion in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. the capital city of seoul is also the countrys largest city and chief industrial center. according to the 2005 census, seoul had a population of 10 million inhabitants. the seoul national capital area has 24.5 million inhabitants the population has also been shaped by international migration. after world war1.5 million, and has more than doubled, to 50 million, by 2010.south korea is considered one of the most ethnically homogeneous societies in the world with ethnic koreans representing approximately 96% of total population. precise numbers are difficult since statistics do not record ethnicity and given many immigrants are ethnically korean themselves, and some south korean citizens are not ethnically korean. south korea is nevertheless becoming a more multi-ethnic society over time due to immigration.the percentage of foreign nationals has been growing rapidly. as of 2016, south korea had 1,413,758 foreign residents, 2.75% of the population; however, many of them are ethnic koreans with a foreign citizenship. for example, migrants from china  regardless of the ethnicity, there are 28,500 us military personnel serving in south korea, most serving a one-year unaccompanied tour  in addition, about 43,000 english teachers from english-speaking countries reside temporarily in korea. currently, south korea has one of the highest rates of growth of foreign born population, with about 30,000 foreign born residents obtaining south korean citizenship every year since 2010.large number of ethnic koreans live overseas, sometimes in korean ethnic neighbourhoods also known as koreatowns. the four largest diaspora population can be found in china  at an annual rate of approximately 9 births per 1000 people. fertility saw some modest increase afterwards, but dropped to a new global low in 2017, with fewer than 30,000 births per month for the first time since records began and less than 1 child per woman as of 2018 trends. the average life expectancy in 2008 was 79.10 years,  but by 2015 it had increased to around 81. south korea has the steepest decline in working age population of the oecd nations. in 2015, national statistical office estimated that the population of the country will have reached its peak by 2035.a centralized administration in south korea oversees the process for the education of children from kindergarten to the third and final year of high school. the school year is divided into two semesters, the first of which begins at the beginning of march and ends in mid-july, the second of which begins in late august and ends in mid-february. the schedules are not uniformly standardized and vary from school to school. most south korean middle schools and high schools have school uniforms, modeled on western-style uniforms. boys uniforms usually consist of trousers and white shirts, and girls wear skirts and white shirts south korea is one of the top-performing oecd countries in reading literacy, mathematics and sciences with the average student scoring 519, compared with the oecd average of 492, placing it ninth in the world and has one of the worlds most highly educated labor forces among oecd countries. the country has one of the worlds highest-educated labour forces among oecd countries. the country is well known for its highly feverish outlook on education, where its national obsession with education has been called ""education fever"". this obsession with education has catapulted the resource poor nation consistently atop the global education rankings where in 2014 national rankings of students math and science scores by the organization for economic and cooperation and development higher education is a serious issue in south korea society, where it is viewed as one of the fundamental cornerstones of south korean life. education is regarded with a high priority for south korean families as success in education is often a source of pride for families and within south korean society at large, and is a necessity to improve ones socioeconomic position in south korean society. south koreans view education as the main propeller of social mobility for themselves and their family as a gateway to the south korean middle class. graduating from a top university is the ultimate marker of prestige, high socioeconomic status, promising marriage prospects, and a respectable career path. the entrance into a top tier higher educational institution leads to a prestigious, secure and well-paid white collar job with the government, banks, or a major south korean conglomerate such as samsung, hyundai or lg electronics. an average south korean childs life revolves around education as pressure to succeed academically is deeply ingrained in south korean children from an early age. with incredible pressure on high school students to secure places at the nations best universities, its institutional reputation and alumni networks are strong predictors of future career prospects. the top three universities in south korea, often referred to as ""sky"", are seoul national university, korea university and yonsei university. intense competition for top grades and academic pressure to be the top student is deeply ingrained in the psyche of south korean students at a young age. yet with only so many places at the nations most prestigious universities and even fewer places at top-tier companies, many young people remain disappointed and are often unwilling to lower their sights with the result of many feeling as underachievers. there is a major cultural taboo in south korean society attached to those who have not achieved formal university education where those who do not hold university degrees face social prejudice and are often looked down by others as second-class citizens resulting in fewer opportunities for employment, improvement of ones socioeconomic position and prospects for marriage.in 2015, the country spent 5.1% of its gdp on all levels of education 017, the country ranked fifth for the percentage of 25 to 64 year olds that have attained tertiary education with 47.7 percent. in addition, 69.8 percent of south koreans aged 25 percent of south koreans aged 25013 alone, nearly 3.3 million south korean university graduates were jobless, leaving many graduates overqualified for jobs requiring less education. further criticism has been stemmed for causing labor shortages in various skilled blue collar labor and vocational occupations, where many go unfilled as the negative social stigma associated with vocational careers and not having a university degree continues to remain deep-rooted in south korean society.korean is the official language of south korea, and is classified by most linguists as a language isolate. korean is not related to any chinese languages, although it incorporates a number of words that are chinese in origin. additionally, korean spoken in south korea uses a significant number of loan words from english and other european languages. korean uses an indigenous writing system called hangul, created in 1446 by king sejong to provide a convenient alternative to the classical chinese hanja characters that were difficult to learn and did not fit the korean language well. south korea still uses some chinese hanja characters in limited areas, such as print media and legal documentation.the korean language in south korea has a standard dialect known as seoul religion in south korea according to the results of the census of 2015 more than half of the south korean population  in a 2012 survey, 52% declared themselves ""religious"", 31% said they were ""not religious"" and 15% identified themselves as ""convinced atheists"". of the people who are affiliated with a religious organization, most are christians and buddhists. according to the 2015 census, 27.6% of the population were christians  other religions include islam  the homegrown sect of won buddhism, and a variety of indigenous religions, including cheondoism  overall, between the 2005 and 2015 censuses there has been a slight decline of christianity christianity is south koreas largest organized religion, accounting for more than half of all south korean adherents of religious organizations. there are approximately 13.5 million christians in south korea today; about two thirds of them belonging to protestant churches, and the rest to the roman catholic church. the number of protestants has been stagnant throughout the 1990s and the 2000s, but increased to a peak level throughout the 2010s. roman catholics increased significantly between the 1980s and the 2000s, but declined throughout the 2010s. christianity, unlike in other east asian countries, found fertile ground in korea in the 18th century, and by the end of the 18th century it persuaded a large part of the population as the declining monarchy supported it and opened the country to widespread proselytism as part of a project of westernization. the weakness of korean sindo, which, unlike japanese shinto and chinas religious system, never developed into a national religion of high status, combined with the impoverished state of korean buddhism  the japanese colonization of the first half of the 20th century further strengthened the identification of christianity with korean nationalism, as the japanese coopted native korean sindo into the nipponic imperial shinto that they tried to establish in the peninsula. widespread christianization of the koreans took place during state shinto, after its abolition, and then in the independent south korea as the newly established military government supported christianity and tried to utterly oust native sindo.among christian denominations, presbyterianism is the largest. about nine million people belong to one of the hundred different presbyterian churches; the biggest ones are the hapdong presbyterian church, tonghap presbyterian church, the koshin presbyterian church. south korea is also the second-largest missionary-sending nation, after the united states.buddhism was introduced to korea in the 4th century. it became soon a dominant religion in the southeastern kingdom of silla, the region that hitherto hosts the strongest concentration of buddhists in south korea. in the other states of the three kingdoms period, goguryeo and baekje, it was made the state religion respectively in 372 and 528. it remained the state religion in later silla  most of them affiliated to the jogye order. most of the national treasures of south korea are buddhist artifacts.south korea has a universal healthcare system. it has the worlds second best healthcare system.suicide in south korea is a serious and widespread problem and the country ranks poorly on world happiness reports for a high-income state. the suicide rate was the highest in the g20 in 2015 south korean hospitals have advanced medical equipment and facilities readily available, ranking 4th for mri units per capita and 6th for ct scanners per capita in the oecd. it also had the oecds second largest number of hospital beds per 1000 people at 9.56 beds.life expectancy has been rising rapidly and south korea ranked 11th in the world for life expectancy at 82.3 years by the who in 2015. it also has the third highest health adjusted life expectancy in the world.south korea maintains diplomatic relations with more than 188 countries. the country has also been a member of the united nations since 1991, when it became a member state at the same time as north korea. on january 1, 2007, former south korean foreign minister ban ki-moon served as un secretary-general from 2007 to 2016. it has also developed links with the association of southeast asian nations as both a member of asean plus three, a body of observers, and the east asia summit  despite mutual animosity, reconciliation efforts have continued since the initial separation between north and south korea. political figures such as kim koo worked to reconcile the two governments even after the korean war. with longstanding animosity following the korean war from 1950 to 1953, north korea and south korea signed an agreement to pursue peace. on october 4, 2007, roh moo-hyun and north korean leader kim jong-il signed an eight-point agreement on issues of permanent peace, high-level talks, economic cooperation, renewal of train services, highway and air travel, and a joint olympic cheering squad.despite the sunshine policy and efforts at reconciliation, the progress was complicated by north korean missile tests in 1993, 1998, 2006, 2009, and 2013. as of early 2009, relationships between north and south korea were very tense; north korea had been reported to have deployed missiles, ended its former agreements with south korea, and threatened south korea and the united states not to interfere with a satellite launch it had planned. north and south korea are still technically at war  on may 27, 2009, north korean media declared that the armistice is no longer valid because of the south korean governments pledge to ""definitely join"" the proliferation security initiative. to further complicate and intensify strains between the two nations, the sinking of the south korean warship cheonan in march 2010, is affirmed by the south korean government to have been caused by a north korean torpedo, which the north denies. president lee myung-bak declared in may 2010 that seoul would cut all trade with north korea as part of measures primarily aimed at striking back at north korea diplomatically and financially, except for the joint kaesong industrial project, and humanitarian aid. north korea initially threatened to sever all ties, to completely abrogate the previous pact of non-aggression, and to expel all south koreans from a joint industrial zone in kaesong, but backtracked on its threats and decided to continue its ties with south korea. despite the continuing ties, kaesong industrial zone has seen a large decrease in investment and manpower as a result of this military conflict. in february 2016, the kaesong complex was closed by seoul in reaction to north koreas launch of a rocket earlier in the month unanimously condemned by the united nations security council.the 2017 election of president moon jae-in has seen a change in approach towards the north, and both sides used the south korean held 2018 winter olympics as an opportunity for engagement, with a very senior north korean political delegation sent to the games, along with a reciprocal visit by senior south korean cabinet members to the north soon afterwards.historically, korea had close relations with the dynasties in china, and some korean kingdoms were members of the imperial chinese tributary system. the korean kingdoms also ruled over some chinese kingdoms including the kitan people and the manchurians before the qing dynasty and received tributes from them. in modern times, before the formation of south korea, korean independence fighters worked with chinese soldiers during the japanese occupation. however, after world war4, 1992. the two countries sought to improve bilateral relations and lifted the forty-year-old trade embargo, and south korean. the republic of korea broke off official relations with the republic of china china has become south koreas largest trading partner by far, sending 26% of south korean exports in 2016 worth $124 billion, as well as an additional $32 billion worth of exports to hong kong. south korea is also chinas 4th largest trading partner, with $93 billion of chinese imports in 2016.the 2017 deployment of thaad defense missiles by the united states military in south korea in response to north korean missile tests has been protested strongly by the chinese government, concerned that the technologically advanced missile defense could be used more broadly against china. relations between the governments have cooled in response, with south korean commercial and cultural interests in china having been targeted, and chinese tourism to south korea having been curtailed. the situation was largely resolved by south korea making significant military concessions to china in exchange for thaad, including not deploying any more anti-ballistic missile systems in south korea and not participating in an alliance between the united states and japan.south korea and russia are participants in the six-party talks on the north koreas nuclear proliferation issue. moon jae-ins administration has focused on increasing south koreas consumption of natural gas. these plans include re-opening dialogue around a natural gas pipeline that would come from russia and pass through north korea. in june 2018, president moon jae-in became the first south korean leader to speak in the russian parliament. on june 22, moon jae-in and putin signed a document for foundation of free trade area.korea and japan have had difficult relations since ancient times, but also significant cultural exchange, with korea acting as the gateway between asia and japan. contemporary perceptions of japan are still largely defined by japans 35 year colonization of korea in the 20th century, which is generally regarded in south korea as having been very negative. japan is today south koreas third largest trading partner, with 12% there were no formal diplomatic ties between south korea and japan directly after independence the end of world war009.a summit between the nations leaders was eventually held on february 9, 2018 during the korean held winter olympics. south korea asked the international olympic committee  and the ioc  said in a statement ""sports stadiums should be free of any political demonstration. when concerns arise at games time we look at them on a case by case basis.""the european union  south korea is the eus tenth largest trade partner, and the eu has become south koreas fourth largest export destination. eu trade with south korea exceeded 015 and has enjoyed an annual average growth rate of 9.8% between 2003 and 2013.the eu has been the single largest foreign investor in south korea since 1962, and accounted for almost 45% of all fdi inflows into korea in 2006. nevertheless, eu companies have significant problems accessing and operating in the south korean market because of stringent standards and testing requirements for products and services often creating barriers to trade. both in its regular bilateral contacts with south korea and through its fta with korea, the eu is seeking to improve this situation.the close relationship began directly after world war ii, when the united states temporarily administrated korea for three years  in 1967, south korea obliged the mutual defense treaty, by sending a large combat troop contingent to support the united states in the vietnam war. the us has over 23,000 troops stationed in south korea, including the u.s. eighth army, seventh air force, and u.s. naval forces korea. the two nations have strong economic, diplomatic, and military ties, although they have at times disagreed with regard to policies towards north korea, and with regard to some of south koreas industrial activities that involve usage of rocket or nuclear technology. there had also been strong anti-american sentiment during certain periods, which has largely moderated in the modern day.the two nations also share a close economic relationship, with the u.s being south koreas second largest trading partner, receiving $66 billion in exports in 2016. in 2007, a free trade agreement known as the republic of korea-united states free trade agreement  it went into effect on march 15, 2012.unresolved tension with north korea has prompted south korea to allocate 2.6% of its gdp and 15% of all

howitzers and 680 helicopters and uavs of numerous types, are assembled to provide additional fire, reconnaissance, and logistics support. south koreas smaller but more advanced artillery force and wide range of airborne reconnaissance platforms are pivotal in the counter-battery suppression of north koreas large artillery force, which operates more than 13,000 artillery systems deployed in various state of fortification and mobility.the south korean navy has made its first major transformation into a blue-water navy through the formation of the strategic mobile fleet, which includes a battle group of chungmugong yi sun-sin class destroyers, dokdo class amphibious assault ship, aip-driven type 214 submarines, and king sejong the great class destroyers, which is equipped with the latest baseline of aegis fleet-defense system that allows the ships to track and destroy multiple cruise missiles and ballistic missiles simultaneously, forming an integral part of south koreas indigenous missile defense umbrella against the north korean militarys missile threat.the south korean air force operates 840 aircraft, making it worlds ninth largest air force, including several types of advanced fighters like f-15k, heavily modified kf-16c/d, and the indigenous t-50 golden eagle, supported by well-maintained fleets of older fighters such as f-4e and kf-5e/f that still effectively serve the air force alongside the more modern aircraft. in an attempt to gain strength in terms of not just numbers but also modernity, the commissioning of four boeing011, korea aerospace industries ltd., south koreas largest plane maker, signed a $400 million deal to sell 16 t-50 golden eagle trainer jets to indonesia, making south korea the first country in asia to export supersonic

with a high-income economy and is the most industrialized member country of the oecd. south korean brands such as lg electronics and samsung are internationally famous and garnered south koreas reputation for its quality electronics and other manufactured goods.its massive investment in education has taken the country from mass illiteracy to a major international technological powerhouse. the countrys national economy benefits from a highly skilled workforce and is among the most educated countries in the world with one of the highest percentages of its citizens holding a tertiary education degree. south koreas economy was one of the worlds fastest-growing from the early 1960s to the late 1990s, and was still one of the fastest-growing developed countries in the 2000s, along with hong kong, singapore and taiwan, the other three asian tigers. it recorded  the fastest rise in average gdp per capita in the world between 1980 and 1990. south koreans refer to this growth as the miracle on the han river. the south korean economy is heavily dependent on international trade, and in 2014, south korea was the fifth-largest exporter and seventh-largest importer in the world.despite the south korean economys high growth potential and apparent structural stability, the country suffers damage to its credit rating in the stock market because of the belligerence of north korea in times of deep military crises, which has an adverse effect on south korean financial markets. the international monetary fund compliments the resilience of the south korean economy against various economic crises, citing low state debt and high fiscal reserves that can quickly be mobilized to address financial emergencies. although it was severely harmed by the asian economic

2010. nuclear power in south korea supplies 45% of electricity production, and research is very active with investigation into a variety of advanced reactors, including a small modular reactor, a liquid-metal fast/transmutation reactor and a high-temperature hydrogen generation design. fuel production and waste handling technologies have also been developed locally. it is also a member of the iter project.south korea is an emerging exporter of nuclear reactors, having concluded agreements with the uae to build and maintain four advanced nuclear reactors, with jordan for a research nuclear reactor, and with argentina for construction and repair of heavy-water nuclear reactors. as of 2010, south korea and turkey are in negotiations regarding construction of two nuclear reactors. south korea is also preparing to bid on construction of a light-water nuclear reactor for argentina.south korea is not allowed to enrich uranium or develop traditional uranium enrichment technology on its own, because of us political pressure, unlike most major nuclear powers such as japan, germany, and france, competitors of south korea in the international nuclear market. this impediment to south koreas indigenous nuclear industrial undertaking has sparked occasional diplomatic rows between the two allies. while south korea is successful in exporting its electricity-generating nuclear technology and nuclear reactors, it cannot capitalize on the market for nuclear enrichment facilities and refineries, preventing it from further expanding its export niche. south korea has sought unique technologies such as pyroprocessing to circumvent these obstacles and seek a more advantageous competition. the us has recently been wary of south koreas burgeoning nuclear program, which south korea insists will be for civilian use only.south korea is the third highest ranked asian country in the world economic forums network readiness index in 2016, 17 million foreign tourists visited south korea with rising tourist prospects, especially from foreign countries outside of asia, the south korean government has set a target of attracting 20 million foreign tourists a year by

countries, china was the most receptive, investing 1.4 billion in south korea, with much of the investment within its service sector, a sevenfold increase from 2001. according to an analysis by economist han sang-wan, a 1 percent increase in the exports of korean cultural content pushes consumer goods exports up 0.083 percent while a 1 percent increase in korean pop content exports to a country produces a 0.019 percent bump in tourism.the south korean pension system was created to provide benefits to persons reaching old age, families and persons stricken with death of their primary breadwinner, and for the purposes of stabilizing its nations welfare state. south koreas pension system structure is primarily based on taxation and is income-related. in 2007 there was a total of 18,367,000 insured individuals with only around 511,000 persons excluded from mandatory contribution. the current pension system is divided into four categories distributing benefits to participants through national, military personnel, governmental, and private school teacher pension schemes. the national pension scheme is the primary welfare system providing allowances to the majority of persons. eligibility for the national pension scheme is not dependent on income but on age and residence, where those between the ages of 18 to 59 are covered. any one who is under the age of 18 are dependents of someone who is covered or under a special exclusion where they are allowed to alternative provisions. the national pension scheme is divided into four categories of insured persons 7 without income, and individuals whose spouses are covered under a public welfare system, whether military, governmental, or private school teacher pensions. like the individually insured persons, they too are in charge of covering the full amount of the contribution. voluntarily and continuously insured persons consists of individuals 60 years of age who want to fulfill the minimum insured period of 20 years to qualify for old age pension benefits. excluding the workplace-based insured persons, all the other insured persons personally cover their own 9% contribution.south koreas old-age pension scheme covers individuals age 60 or older for the rest of their life as long as they have satisfied the minimum of 20 years of national pension coverage beforehand. individuals with a minimum of 10 years covered under the national pension scheme and who are 60 years of age are able to be covered by under a reduced old-age pension scheme. there also is an active old-age pension scheme that covers individuals age 60 to 65 engaged in activities yielding earned income. individuals age of 55 and younger than 60 who are not engaged in activities yielding earned income are eligible to be covered under the early old-age pension scheme. around 60% of all korean elders, age 65 and over are entitled to a 5% benefit of their past average income at an average of 90,000 korean won  basic old-age pension schemes covered individuals 65 years of age who earned below an amount set by presidential order. in 2010, that ceiling was 700,00 krw for a single individual and 1,120,000 for a couple, equivalent to around $600.00 and $960.00.scientific and technological development in the south korea at first did not occur largely because of more pressing matters such as the division of korea and the korean war that occurred right after its independence. it was not until the 1960s under the dictatorship of park chung-hee where south koreas economy rapidly grew from industrialisation and the chaebol corporations such as samsung and lg. ever since the industrialization of south koreas economy, south korea has placed its focus on technology-based corporations, which has been supported by infrastructure developments by the government. south korean corporations samsung and lg were ranked first and third largest mobile phone companies in the world in the first quarter of 2012, respectively. an estimated 90% of south koreans own a mobile phone. aside from placing/receiving calls and text messaging, mobile phones in the country are widely used for watching digital multimedia broadcasting  over one million dmb phones have been sold and the three major wireless communications providers sk telecom, kt, and lg u+ provide coverage in all major cities and other areas. south korea has the fastest internet download speeds in the world, with an average download speed of 25.3 mbit/s.south korea leads the oecd in graduates in science and engineering. from 2014 to 2019, the country ranked first among the most innovative countries in the bloomberg innovation index. additionally, south korea today is known as a launchpad of a mature mobile market, where developers can reap benefits of a market where very few technology constraints exist. there is a growing trend of inventions of new types of media or apps, utilizing the 4g and 5g internet infrastructure in south korea. south korea has today the infrastructures to meet a density of population and culture that has the capability to create strong local particularity.following cyberattacks in the first half of 2013, whereby government, news-media, television station, and bank websites were compromised, the national government committed to the training of 5,000 new cybersecurity experts by 2017. the south korean government blamed north korea for these attacks, as well as incidents that occurred in 2009, 2011 and 2012, but pyongyang denies the accusations.in late september 2013, a computer-security competition jointly sponsored by the defense ministry and the national intelligence service was announced. the winners were announced on september 29, 2013 and shared a total prize pool of 80 million won south koreas government maintains a broad-ranging approach toward the regulation of specific online content and imposes a substantial level of censorship on election-related discourse and on many websites that the government deems subversive or socially harmful.south korea has sent up 10 satellites since 1992, all using foreign rockets and overseas launch pads, notably arirang-1 in 1999, and arirang-2 in 2006 as part of its space partnership with russia. arirang-1 was lost in space in 2008, after nine years in service.in april 2008, yi so-yeon became the first korean to fly in space, aboard the russian soyuz tma-12.in june 2009, the first spaceport of south korea, naro space center, was completed at goheung, jeollanam-do. the launch of naro-1 in august 2009 resulted in a failure. the second attempt in june 2010 was also unsuccessful. however, the third launch of the naro 1 in january 2013 was successful. the government plans to develop naro-2 by the year 2018.south koreas efforts to build an indigenous space launch vehicle have been marred due to persistent political pressure from the united states, who had for many decades hindered south koreas indigenous rocket and missile development programs in fear of their possible connection to clandestine military ballistic missile programs, which korea many times insisted did not violate the research and development guidelines stipulated by us-korea agreements on restriction of south korean rocket technology research and development. south korea has sought the assistance of foreign countries such as russia through mtcr commitments to supplement its restricted domestic rocket technology. the two failed kslv-i launch vehicles were based on the universal rocket module, the first stage of the russian angara rocket, combined with a solid-fueled second stage built by south korea.robotics has been included in the list of main national r&d projects in korea since 2003. in 2009, the government announced plans to build robot-themed parks in incheon and masan with a mix of public and private funding.in 2005, korea advanced institute of science and technology ever-1 has been succeeded by more complex models with improved movement and vision.plans of creating english-teaching robot assistants to compensate for the shortage of teachers were announced in february 2010, with the robots being deployed to most preschools and kindergartens by 2013. robotics are also incorporated in the entertainment sector as well; the korean robot game festival has been held every year since 2004 to promote science and robot technology.since the 1980s, the korean government has invested in the development of a domestic biotechnology industry, and the sector is projected to grow to $6.5 billion by 2010. the medical sector accounts for a large part of the production, including production of hepatitis vaccines and antibiotics.recently, research and development in genetics and cloning has received increasing attention, with the first successful cloning of a dog, snuppy  by the seoul national university in 2007.the rapid growth of the industry has resulted in significant voids in regulation of ethics, as was highlighted by the scientific misconduct case involving hwang woo-suk.south korea shares its traditional culture with north korea, but the two koreas have developed distinct contemporary forms of culture since the peninsula was divided in 1945. historically, while the culture of korea has been heavily influenced by that of neighboring china, it has nevertheless managed to develop a unique cultural identity that is distinct from its larger neighbor. its rich and vibrant culture left 19 unesco intangible cultural heritages of humanity, the third largest in the world, along with 12 world heritage sites. the south korean ministry of culture, sports and tourism actively encourages the traditional arts, as well as modern forms, through funding and education programs.the industrialization and urbanization of south korea have brought many changes to the way modern koreans live. changing economics and lifestyles have led to a concentration of population in major cities, especially the capital seoul, with multi-generational households separating into nuclear family living arrangements. a 2014 euromonitor study found that south koreans drink the most alcohol on a weekly basis compared to the rest of the world. south koreans drink 13.7 shots of liquor per week on average and, of the 44 other countries analyzed, russia, the philippines, and thailand follow.korean art has been highly influenced by buddhism and confucianism, which can be seen in the many traditional paintings, sculptures, ceramics and the performing arts. korean pottery and porcelain, such as joseons baekja and buncheong, and goryeos celadon are well known throughout the world. the korean tea ceremony, pansori, talchum and buchaechum are also notable korean performing arts.post-war modern korean art started to flourish in the 1960s and 1970s, when south korean artists took interest in geometrical shapes and intangible subjects. establishing a harmony between man and nature was also a favorite of this time. because of social instability, social issues appeared as main subjects in the 1980s. art was influenced by various international events and exhibits in korea, and with it brought more diversity. the olympic sculpture garden in 1988, the transposition of the 1993 edition of the whitney biennial to seoul, the creation of the gwangju biennale and the korean pavilion at the venice biennale in 1995 were notable events.because of south koreas tumultuous history, construction and destruction has been repeated endlessly, resulting in an interesting melange of architectural styles and designs.korean traditional architecture is characterized by its harmony with nature. ancient architects adopted the bracket system characterized by thatched roofs and heated floors called ondol. people of the upper classes built bigger houses with elegantly curved tiled roofs with lifting eaves. traditional architecture can be seen in the palaces and temples, preserved old houses called hanok, and special sites like hahoe folk village, yangdong village of gyeongju and korean folk village. traditional architecture may also be seen at the nine unesco world heritage sites in south korea.western architecture was first introduced to korea at the end of the 19th century. churches, offices for foreign legislation, schools and university buildings were built in new styles. with the annexation of korea by japan in 1910 the colonial regime intervened in koreas architectural heritage, and japanese-style modern architecture was imposed. the anti-japanese sentiment, and the korean war, led to the destruction of most buildings constructed during that time.korean architecture entered a new phase of development during the post-korean war reconstruction, incorporating modern architectural trends and styles. stimulated by the economic growth in the 1970s and 1980s, active redevelopment saw new horizons in architectural design. in the aftermath of the 1988 seoul olympics, south korea has witnessed a wide variation of styles in its architectural landscape due, in large part, to the opening up of the market to foreign architects. contemporary architectural efforts have been constantly trying to balance the traditional philosophy of ""harmony with nature"" and the fast-paced urbanization that the country has been going through in recent years.korean cuisine, hanguk yori in addition to domestic consumption, south korea has a thriving entertainment industry where various facets of south korean entertainment, including television dramas, films, and popular music, has generated significant financial revenues for the nations economy. the cultural phenomenon known as hallyu or the ""korean wave"", has swept many countries across asia making south korea a major soft power as an exporter of popular culture and entertainment, rivaling western nations such as the united states and the united kingdom.until the 1990s, trot and traditional korean folk based ballads dominated south korean popular music. the emergence of the south korean pop group seo taiji and boys in 1992 marked a turning point for south korean popular music, also known as k-pop, as the genre modernized itself from incorporating elements of popular musical genres from across the world such as western popular music, experimental, jazz, gospel, latin, classical, hip hop, rhythm and blues, electronic dance, reggae, country, folk, and rock on top of its uniquely traditional korean music roots. western-style pop, hip hop, rhythm and blues, rock, folk, electronic dance oriented acts have become dominant in the modern south korean popular music scene, though trot is still enjoyed among older south koreans. k-pop stars and groups are well known across asia and have found international fame making millions of dollars in export revenue. many k-pop acts have also been able secure a strong overseas following using online social media platforms such as the video sharing website youtube. south korean singer psy became an international sensation when his song ""gangnam style"" topped global music charts in 2012. since the success of the film shiri in 1999, the korean film industry has begun to gain recognition internationally. domestic film has a dominant share of the market, partly because of the existence of screen quotas requiring cinemas to show korean films at least 73 days a year. 2019s parasite, directed by bong joon ho, became the highest-grossing film in south korea as well as the first non-english language film to win best picture at the united states-based academy awards that year amongst numerous other accolades.south korean television shows have become popular outside of korea. south korean television dramas, known as k-dramas, have begun to find fame internationally. many dramas tend to have a romantic focus, such as princess hours, youre beautiful, playful kiss, my name is kim sam soon, boys over flowers, winter sonata, autumn in my heart, full house, city hunter, all about eve, secret garden, i can hear your voice, masters sun, my love from the star, healer, descendants of the sun and guardian: the lonely

annually, doubling the standard & poors average annual return for those years.  by 2000, the consolidation of grocery store chains, the spread of retailers such as walmart, and growth of private-label brands caused competition for shelf space, and put price pressure on the companys products.  the decline was also attributed to an inadequate response to broad demographic changes in the united states, particularly the growth in population among hispanic and increased spending power of african americans.on april 4, 1991, former u.s. senator henry john heinz iii, the third-generation successor to the heinz fortune, and six other people were killed when a bell 412 helicopter and a piper aerostar with heinz aboard collided in mid-air above merion elementary school in lower merion

canco corporation had received a one-year license to process tomatoes at the facility, saving some 250 jobs.as a result of this corporate restructuring and the angry canadian response, a rival food company, frenchs, began producing their own ketchup brand using leamington produce. it marketed the brand with an appeal to canadian patriotism. this successful campaign, combined with a canadian grassroots effort on facebook encouraging purchasing of the frenchs product, resulted in heinzs market share in canada dropping from 84 to 76%, a significant shift in a mature market. this undesirable development was exacerbated in 2018 when canadian tariffs were erected against specific american exports, which includes ketchup produced in the united states, in retaliation to the us president trumps tariffs on canadian steel and aluminum exports. heinz conducted a belated public relations campaign in canada to try to counter the public anger against them, a task made more difficult by public sentiment rising to encourage a boycott of american goods in reaction of us president trumps rhetoric against canada.heinz ketchup is available in india in two varieties, the standard tomato

subsequent closure of the aston factory. subsequently, heinz suffered severe supply issues for the ex-hp foods brands as the elst factory struggled to integrate production, resulting in significant negative coverage from uk retailers. heinz was forced to begin bottling sauce in spain, shipping ready-made sauce from elst, to get product back into supply.the uk headquarters moved from hayes to the

primary, bloomberg defeated herman badillo, a former democratic congressman, to become the republican nominee. after a runoff, the democratic nomination went to new york city public advocate mark j. green.bloomberg received giulianis endorsement to succeed him in the 2001 election. he also had a huge campaign spending advantage. although new york citys campaign finance law restricts the amount of

prompted an investigation beginning in february 2010 by the office of new york county district attorney cyrus vance jr. into possible improprieties. the independence party later questioned how haggerty spent the money, which was to go to poll-watchers. former new york state senator martin connor contended that because the bloomberg donations were made to an independence party housekeeping account rather than to an account meant for current campaigns, this was a violation of campaign finance laws. haggerty also spent money from a separate $200,000 donation from bloomberg on office space.on september 13, 2013, bloomberg announced that he would not endorse any of the candidates to succeed him. on his radio show, he stated, ""i dont want to do anything that complicates it for the

hard as i can.""speaking on the final night of the 2020 democratic national convention, bloomberg took aim at trumps handling of the covid-19 pandemic and the american economy: ""would you rehire or work for someone who ran your business into the ground? who always does whats best for him or her, even when it hurts the company, and whose reckless decisions put you in danger, and who spends more time tweeting than working? if the answer is no, why the hell would we ever rehire donald trump for another four years?""bloomberg was a lifelong democrat until 2001, when he switched to the

"dentistry, also known as dental medicine and oral medicine, is a branch of medicine that consists of the study, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of diseases, disorders, and conditions of the oral cavity, commonly in the dentition  but also the oral mucosa, and of adjacent and related structures and tissues, particularly in the maxillofacial  although primarily associated with teeth among the general public, the field of dentistry or dental medicine is not limited to teeth but includes other aspects of the craniofacial complex including the temporomandibular joint and other supporting, muscular, lymphatic, nervous, vascular, and anatomical structures.dentistry is often also understood to subsume the now largely defunct medical specialty of stomatology dental treatments are carried out by a dental team, which often consists of a dentist and dental auxiliaries  skeletal remains from mehgarh dated to that time show evidence of teeth having been drilled with flint tools to remove decay, a method found to be ""surprisingly effective"". dentistry is thought to have been the first specialization in medicine. the modern movement of evidence-based dentistry calls for the use of high-quality scientific evidence to guide decision-making.the term dentistry comes from dentist, which comes from french dentiste, which comes from the french and latin words for tooth. the term for the associated scientific study of teeth is odontology  according to the world health organization, oral diseases are major public health problems due to their high incidence and prevalence across the globe, with the disadvantaged affected more than other socio-economic groups.the majority of dental treatments are carried out to prevent or treat the two most common oral diseases which are dental caries all dentists in the united states undergo at least three years of undergraduate studies, but nearly all complete a bachelors degree. this schooling is followed by four years of dental school to qualify as a ""doctor of dental surgery"" by nature of their general training they can carry out the majority of dental treatments such as restorative  many studies have also shown that gum disease is associated with an increased risk of diabetes, heart disease, and preterm birth. the concept that oral health can affect systemic health and disease is referred to as ""oral-systemic health"".dr. john m. harris started the worlds first dental school in bainbridge, ohio, and helped to establish dentistry as a health profession. it opened on 21 february 1828, and today is a dental museum. the first dental college, baltimore college of dental surgery, opened in baltimore, maryland, us in 1840. the second in the united states was the ohio college of dental surgery, established in cincinnati, ohio, in 1845. the philadelphia college of dental surgery followed in 1852. in 1907, temple university accepted a bid to incorporate the school.studies show that dentists that graduated from different countries, or even from different dental schools in one country, may make different clinical decisions for the same clinical condition. for example, dentists that graduated from israeli dental schools may recommend the removal of asymptomatic impacted third molar in the united kingdom, the 1878 british dentists act and 1879 dentists register limited the title of ""dentist"" and ""dental surgeon"" to qualified and registered practitioners. however, others could legally describe themselves as ""dental experts"" or ""dental consultants"". the practice of dentistry in the united kingdom became fully regulated with the 1921 dentists act, which required the registration of anyone practising dentistry. the british dental association, formed in 1880 with sir john tomes as president, played a major role in prosecuting dentists practising illegally. dentists in the united kingdom are now regulated by the general dental council.in korea, taiwan, japan, finland, sweden, brazil, chile, the united states, and canada, a dentist is a healthcare professional qualified to practice dentistry after graduating with a degree of either doctor of dental surgery  within the european union the education has to be at least five years. dentists usually complete between five and eight years of post-secondary education before practising. though not mandatory, many dentists choose to complete an internship or residency focusing on specific aspects of dental care after they have received their dental degree.some dentists undertake further training after their initial degree in order to specialize. exactly which subjects are recognized by dental registration bodies varies according to location. examples include:tooth decay was low in pre-agricultural societies, but the advent of farming society about 10,000 years ago correlated with an increase in tooth decay  an infected tooth from italy partially cleaned with flint tools, between 13,820 and 14,160 years old, represents the oldest known dentistry, although a 2017 study suggests that 130,000 years ago the neanderthals already used rudimentary dentistry tools. the indus valley has yielded evidence of dentistry being practised as far back as 7000 bc, during the stone age. the neolithic site of mehrgarh indicates that this form of dentistry involved curing tooth related disorders with bow drills operated, perhaps, by skilled bead-crafters. the reconstruction of this ancient form of dentistry showed that the methods used were reliable and effective. the earliest dental filling, made of beeswax, was discovered in slovenia and dates from 6500 years ago. dentistry was practised in prehistoric malta, as evidenced by a skull which had an abscess lanced from the root of a tooth dating back to around 2500 bc.an ancient sumerian text describes a ""tooth worm"" as the cause of dental caries. evidence of this belief has also been found in ancient india, egypt, japan, and china. the legend of the worm is also found in the homeric hymns, and as late as the 14th century ad the surgeon guy de chauliac still promoted the belief that worms cause tooth decay.recipes for the treatment of toothache, infections and loose teeth are spread throughout the ebers papyrus, kahun papyri, brugsch papyrus, and hearst papyrus of ancient egypt. the edwin smith papyrus, written in the 17th century bc but which may reflect previous manuscripts from as early as 3000 bc, discusses the treatment of dislocated or fractured jaws. in the 18th century bc, the code of hammurabi referenced dental extraction twice as it related to punishment. examination of the remains of some ancient egyptians and greco-romans reveals early attempts at dental prosthetics. however, it is possible the prosthetics were prepared after death for aesthetic reasons.ancient greek scholars hippocrates and aristotle wrote about dentistry, including the eruption pattern of teeth, treating decayed teeth and gum disease, extracting teeth with forceps, and using wires to stabilize loose teeth and fractured jaws. some say the first use of dental appliances or bridges comes from the etruscans from as early as 700 bc. in ancient egypt, hesy-ra is the first named ""dentist""  the earliest dental amalgams were first documented in a tang dynasty medical text written by the chinese physician su kung in 659, and appeared in germany in 1528.during the islamic golden age dentistry was discussed in several famous books of medicine such as the canon in medicine written by avicenna and al-tasreef by al-zahrawi who is considered the greatest surgeon of the middle ages, avicenna said that jaw fracture should be reduced according to the occlusal guidance of the teeth; this principle is still valid in modern times. while al-zahrawi made a lot of surgical tools that resemble the modern tools.historically, dental extractions have been used to treat a variety of illnesses. during the middle ages and throughout the 19th century, dentistry was not a profession in itself, and often dental procedures were performed by barbers or general physicians. barbers usually limited their practice to extracting teeth which alleviated pain and associated chronic tooth infection. instruments used for dental extractions date back several centuries. in the 14th century, guy de chauliac most probably invented the dental pelican  which, in turn, was replaced by modern forceps in the 19th century.the first book focused solely on dentistry was the ""artzney buchlein"" in 1530, and the first dental textbook written in english was called ""operator for the teeth"" by charles allen in 1685.in the united kingdom, there was no formal qualification for the providers of dental treatment until 1859 and it was only in 1921 that the practice of dentistry was limited to those who were professionally qualified. the royal commission on the national health service in 1979 reported that there were then more than twice as many registered dentists per 10,000 population in the uk than there were in 1921.it was between 1650 and 1800 that the science of modern dentistry developed. the english physician thomas browne in his a letter to a friend fauchard was the pioneer of dental prosthesis, and he discovered many methods to replace lost teeth. he suggested that substitutes could be made from carved blocks of ivory or bone. he also introduced dental braces, although they were initially made of gold, he discovered that the teeth position could be corrected as the teeth would follow the pattern of the wires. waxed linen or silk threads were usually employed to fasten the braces. his contributions to the world of dental science consist primarily of his 1728 publication le chirurgien dentiste or the surgeon dentist.  the french text included ""basic oral anatomy and function, dental construction, and various operative and restorative techniques, and effectively separated dentistry from the wider category of surgery"".after fauchard, the study of dentistry rapidly expanded. two important books, natural history of human teeth major advances were made in the 19th century, and dentistry evolved from a trade to a profession. the profession came under government regulation by the end of the 19th century. in the uk the dentist act was passed in 1878 and the british dental association formed in 1879. in the same year, francis brodie imlach was the first ever dentist to be elected president of the royal college of surgeons long term occupational noise exposure can contribute to permanent hearing loss, which is referred to as noise-induced hearing loss  nihl can occur when an individual is exposed to sound levels above 90 dba according to the occupational safety and health administration  for the national institute for occupational safety and health  while a majority of the tools do not exceed 75 dba, prolonged exposure over many years can lead to hearing loss or complaints of tinnitus. few dentists have reported using personal hearing protective devices, which could offset any potential hearing loss or tinnitus.there is a movement in modern dentistry to place a greater emphasis on high-quality scientific evidence in decision-making. evidence-based dentistry  it was first introduced by gordon guyatt and the evidence-based medicine working group at mcmaster university in ontario, canada in the 1990s. it is part of the larger movement toward evidence-based medicine and other evidence-based practices.dentistry is unique in that it requires dental students to have competence-based clinical skills that can only be acquired through specialized laboratory training and direct patient care. this necessitates the need for a scientific and professional basis of care with a foundation of research-based education. the accreditation of dental schools plays a role in enhancing the quality of  dental education.there are controversial articles that are not evidence based and rely on opinions that are published and attract attention.",1,0
"snickers is a brand name chocolate bar made by the american company mars, incorporated, consisting of nougat topped with caramel and peanuts that has been enrobed in milk chocolate. the annual global sales of snickers was $2 billion as of 2004.in the united kingdom, the isle of man, jersey, guernsey, ireland and europe, snickers was sold under the brand name marathon until 1990. snickers-brand marathon energy bars have since been sold in some markets.in 1930,  mars introduced snickers, named after the favorite horse of the mars family.  the snickers chocolate bar consists of nougat, peanuts, and caramel with a chocolate coating. the bar was marketed under the name ""marathon"" in the uk and ireland until 1990, when mars decided to align the uk product with the global snickers name a replacement for the king size snickers bar was launched in the uk in 2004, and designed to conform to the september 2004 food and drink federation  reducing portion size, clearer food labels, and reduction of the levels of fat, sugar, and salt were among the fdf pledges. mars incorporated pledged to phase out their king-size bars in 2005 and replace them with shareable bars. a mars spokesman said: ""our king-size bars that come in one portion will be changed so they are shareable or can be consumed on more than one occasion. the name king-size will be phased out.""these were eventually replaced by the duo - a double bar pack.  though this change to duos reduced the weight from 3.5 to 3.29 ounces  as mars stated fulfillment of their promise, the duo format was met with criticism by the national obesity forum and national consumer council.in december 2000, tens of thousands of snickers and mars bars were removed from new south wales store shelves due to a series of threatening letters which resulted in fears that the chocolate bars had been poisoned. mars received letters from an unidentified individual indicating that they planned to plant poisoned chocolate bars on store shelves. the last letter sent included a snickers bar contaminated with a substance which was later identified as rat poison. the letters claimed that there were seven additional chocolate bars which had been tampered with and which were for sale to the public. as a precautionary measure, mars issued a massive recall. mars said that there had been no demand for money and complaints directed to an unidentified third party.the early  includes white sugar, sweet milk chocolate, corn syrup, peanuts, milk condensed with sugar, coconut oil, malted milk, whites of eggs and salt. by 2019 the ingredients for the original bar had been refined to milk chocolate the usda lists the caloric value of a 2-ounce  as of 2018, the united kingdom bar has a weight of 48g, with 245 kcal, and the canadian bar 52g with 250 kcal.over the years, the bar weight has decreased: before 2009, in the uk a single snickers bar had a weight of 62.5g. this weight was subsequently reduced to 58g in 2009, and to 48g in 2013. in the united states the listed weight in 2018 was 52.7 g.containing approximately 450 calories  deep fried chocolate bars  and in the early 2000s, became popular at american state fairs.in 2012, the british food commission highlighted celebrity chef antony worrall thompsons ""snickers pie"", which contained five snickers bars among other ingredients, suggesting it was one of the unhealthiest desserts ever; one slice providing ""over 1,250 calories in 1980, snickers  sports promotions in international games continued to be a prominent marketing tool for mars, that would keep snickers as an international brand while also selling local bars in some markets.beginning in 1995, snickers ran ads which featured someone making a self-inflicted mistake, with the voice-over saying ""not going anywhere for a while? grab a snickers!"" the tag line at the end of each ad proclaimed, ""hungry? why wait?""one such ad had a player for a fictional american football team showing off his new tattoo of the teams logo on his back to his teammates. he then shows it to his head coach who, after complimenting the tattoo, immediately tells him that hes been traded to miami. the player then goes to have his old teams logo replaced with the new teams logo.some of the ads were done in conjunction with the national football league, with whom snickers had a sponsorship deal at the time. one ad featured a member of the grounds crew at arrowhead stadium painting the field for an upcoming kansas city chiefs game in hot, late-summer weather. after finishing one of the end zones, and visibly exhausted, one of the chiefs players walks up to him and says the field looks great, ""but who are the chefs?"", showing that despite all the hard work the painter accidentally omitted the ""i"" in chiefs. another had marv levy in the buffalo bills locker room lecturing his team that ""no ones going anywhere"" until the bills figure out how to actually win a super bowl.in 2007, snickers launched a campaign which featured henry viii and a viking among others who attend the ""snickers feast"". it consisted of various commercials of the gang and their adventures on the feast.on february 4, 2007, during super bowl xli, snickers commercials aired. this resulted in complaints by gay and lesbian groups against the maker of the candy bar, masterfoods usa of hackettstown, new jersey, a division of mars, incorporated. the commercial showed a pair of auto mechanics accidentally touching lips while sharing a snickers bar. after quickly pulling away, one mechanic says, ""i think we just accidentally kissed."", and another mechanic exclaims, ""quick! do something manly!"" and in three of the four versions, they do so mostly in the form of injury, including tearing out chest hair, striking each other with a very large pipe wrench, and drinking motor oil and windshield washer fluid. in the fourth version, however, a third mechanic shows up and asks ""is there room for three in this love boat?""complaints were lodged against masterfoods that the ads were homophobic. human rights campaign president joe solmonese is quoted as saying""this type of jeering from professional sports figures at the sight of two men kissing fuels the kind of anti-gay bullying that haunts countless gay and lesbian school children on playgrounds all across the country.""gay and lesbian alliance against defamation in 2006, mr. t starred in a snickers advertisement in the uk where he rides up in an army tank and shouts abuse at a football player who appears to be faking an injury, threatening to introduce him to his friend pain. another advertisement featured mr. t launching bars at a swimmer who appeared to refuse to get in a swimming pool because of the cold temperature of the water. in 2008, a european snickers commercial in which mr. t uses a jeep-mounted minigun to fire snickers bars at a speedwalker for being a ""disgrace to the man race"" was pulled after complaints from a us pressure group that the advertisement was homophobic. these advertisements usually ended with mr. t saying ""snickers: get some nuts!""in nascar racing, snickers  later that year, snickers commercials featured singers aretha franklin and liza minnelli, and comedians richard lewis and roseanne barr. a 2011 commercial featured actors joe pesci and don rickles.in latin america, the slogan was the same as in the uk version, except that men doing extreme sports turning into the mexican singer anah013, the late robin williams and bobcat goldthwait also appeared in a snickers football commercial. in march 2014, a commercial featuring godzilla was released to promote the 2014 godzilla film. in the commercial, godzilla is shown hanging out with humans on the beach, riding dirt bikes, and water skiing; he only begins rampaging once hes hungry. after being fed a snickers bar, he resumes having fun with the humans.in february 2015, snickers super bowl xlix commercial featured a parody of a scene from an episode of the brady bunch entitled ""the subject was noses."" in the commercial, carol and mike try to calm down a very angry machete in 2016, for super bowl 50, another snickers commercial was made, featuring willem dafoe the uk version of the campaign usually used british celebrities and, up until 2018, retained the slogan from the mr. t. era. in the initial advertisement, joan collins and stephanie beacham featured as locker room footballers who had turned into them due to being hungry. in 2014, rowan atkinson as mr. bean returned on television by appearing on several uk snickers commercials and cinema spots, in place of a martial arts master who had turned into him as a result of hunger. later, in 2018, elton john appeared in a new advertisement where he turns into african american rapper boogie after he eats a snickers; the latter had turned into the former due to hunger  the offending tweet was removed and an english language apology posted soon after which failed to impact calls for a boycott of the product in wales.",1,0
"dolphin is a common name of aquatic mammals within the infraorder cetacea. the term dolphin usually refers to the extant families delphinidae  dolphins use their conical shaped teeth to capture fast moving prey. they have well-developed hearing which is adapted for both air and water and is so well developed that some can survive even if they are blind. some species are well adapted for diving to great depths. they have a layer of fat, or blubber, under the skin to keep warm in the cold water.although dolphins are widespread, most species prefer the warmer waters of the tropic zones, but some, like the right whale dolphin, prefer colder climates. dolphins feed largely on fish and squid, but a few, like the killer whale, feed on large mammals, like seals. male dolphins typically mate with multiple females every year, but females only mate every two to three years. calves are typically born in the spring and summer months and females bear all the responsibility for raising them. mothers of some species fast and nurse their young for a relatively long period of time. dolphins produce a variety of vocalizations, usually in the form of clicks and whistles.dolphins are sometimes hunted in places such as japan, in an activity known as dolphin drive hunting. besides drive hunting, they also face threats from bycatch, habitat loss, and marine pollution. dolphins have been depicted in various cultures worldwide. dolphins occasionally feature in literature and film, as in the film series free willy. dolphins are sometimes kept in captivity and trained to perform tricks. the most common dolphin species in captivity is the bottlenose dolphin, while there are around 60 captive killer whales.the name is originally from greek   which was related to the greek   the animals name can therefore be interpreted as meaning ""a fish with a womb"". the name was transmitted via the latin delphinus , which in medieval latin became dolfinus and in old french daulphin, which reintroduced the ph into the word. the term mereswine the term dolphin can be used to refer to, under the parvorder odontoceti, all the species in the family delphinidae this term has often been misused in the us, mainly in the fishing industry, where all small cetaceans  while the fish dorado is called dolphin fish. in common usage the term whale is used only for the larger cetacean species, while the smaller ones with a beaked or longer nose are considered dolphins. the name dolphin is used casually as a synonym for bottlenose dolphin, the most common and familiar species of dolphin. there are six species of dolphins commonly thought of as whales, collectively known as blackfish: the killer whale, the melon-headed whale, the pygmy killer whale, the false killer whale, and the two species of pilot whales, all of which are classified under the family delphinidae and qualify as dolphins. though the terms dolphin and porpoise are sometimes used interchangeably, porpoises are not considered dolphins and have different physical features such as a shorter beak and spade-shaped teeth; they also differ in their behavior. porpoises belong to the family phocoenidae and share a common ancestry with the delphinidae.a group of dolphins is called a ""school"" or a ""pod"". male dolphins are called ""bulls"", females ""cows"" and young dolphins are called ""calves"".in 1933, three hybrid dolphins beached off the irish coast; they were hybrids between rissos and bottlenose dolphins. this mating was later repeated in captivity, producing a hybrid calf. in captivity, a bottlenose and a rough-toothed dolphin produced hybrid offspring. a common-bottlenose hybrid lives at seaworld california. other dolphin hybrids live in captivity around the world or have been reported in the wild, such as a bottlenose-atlantic spotted hybrid. the best known hybrid is the wolphin, a false killer whale-bottlenose dolphin hybrid. the wolphin is a fertile hybrid. two wolphins currently live at the sea life park in hawaii; the first was born in 1985 from a male false killer whale and a female bottlenose. wolphins have also been observed in the wild.dolphins are descendants of land-dwelling mammals of the artiodactyl order the primitive cetaceans, or archaeocetes, first took to the sea approximately 49 million years ago and became fully aquatic by 5006, an unusual bottlenose dolphin was captured in japan; it had small fins on each side of its genital slit, which scientists believe to be an unusually pronounced development of these vestigial hind limbs.today, the closest living relatives of cetaceans are the hippopotamuses; these share a semi-aquatic ancestor that branched off from other artiodactyls some 60 million years ago. around 40 million years ago, a common ancestor between the two branched off into cetacea and anthracotheres; anthracotheres became extinct at the end of the pleistocene two-and-a-half million years ago, eventually leaving only one surviving lineage: the hippo.dolphins have torpedo-shaped bodies with generally non-flexible necks, limbs modified into flippers, a tail fin, and bulbous heads. dolphin skulls have small eye orbits, long snouts, and eyes placed on the sides of its head; they lack external ear flaps. dolphins range in size from the 1.78 months, while for the orca, the gestation period is around 17 months. typically dolphins give birth to a single calf, which is, unlike most other mammals, born tail first in most cases. they usually become sexually active at a young age, even before reaching sexual maturity. the age of sexual maturity varies by species and gender.dolphins are known to display non-reproductive sexual behavior, engaging in masturbation, stimulation of the genital area of other individuals using the rostrum or flippers, and homosexual contact.various species of dolphin have been known to engage in sexual behavior up to and including copulation with dolphins of other species. sexual encounters may be violent, with male dolphins sometimes showing aggressive behavior towards both females and other males. male dolphins may also work together and attempt to herd females in estrus, keeping the females by their side by means of both physical aggression and intimidation, to increase their chances of reproductive success. occasionally, dolphins behave sexually towards other animals, including humans.there are various feeding methods among and within species, some apparently exclusive to a single population. fish and squid are the main food, but the false killer whale and the orca also feed on other marine mammals. orcas on occasion also hunt whale species larger than themselves. different breeds of dolphins vary widely in the number of teeth they possess. the orca or killer whale usually carries 40-56 teeth while the popular bottlenose dolphin has anywhere from 72 to 116 conical teeth and its smaller cousin the common dolphin has 188-268 teeth so that the number of teeth each breed carries varies widely between individuals. hybrids between common and bottlenose bred in captivity had an intermediate amount of teeth.one common feeding method is herding, where a pod squeezes a school of fish into a small volume, known as a bait ball. individual members then take turns plowing through the ball, feeding on the stunned fish. coralling is a method where dolphins chase fish into shallow water to catch them more easily. orcas and bottlenose dolphins have also been known to drive their prey onto a beach to feed on it, a behaviour known as beach or strand feeding. some species also whack fish with their flukes, stunning them and sometimes knocking them out of the water.reports of cooperative human-dolphin fishing date back to the ancient roman author and natural philosopher pliny the elder. a modern human-dolphin partnership currently operates in laguna, santa catarina, brazil. here, dolphins drive fish towards fishermen waiting along the shore and signal the men to cast their nets. the dolphins reward is the fish that escape the nets.in shark bay, australia, dolphins catch fish by trapping them in huge conch shells. in ""shelling"", a dolphin brings the shell to the surface and shakes it, so that fish sheltering within fall into the dolphins mouth. from 2007 to 2018, in 5,278 encounters with dolphins, researchers observed 19 dolphins shelling 42 times. the behavior spreads mainly within generations, rather than being passed from mother to offspring.dolphins are capable of making a broad range of sounds using nasal airsacs located just below the blowhole. roughly three categories of sounds can be identified: frequency modulated whistles, burst-pulsed sounds and clicks. dolphins communicate with whistle-like sounds produced by vibrating connective tissue, similar to the way human vocal cords function, and through burst-pulsed sounds, though the nature and extent of that ability is not known. the clicks are directional and are for echolocation, often occurring in a short series called a click train. the click rate increases when approaching an object of interest. dolphin echolocation clicks are amongst the loudest sounds made by marine animals.bottlenose dolphins have been found to have signature whistles, a whistle that is unique to a specific individual. these whistles are used in order for dolphins to communicate with one another by identifying an individual. it can be seen as the dolphin equivalent of a name for humans. these signature whistles are developed during a dolphins first year; it continues to maintain the same sound throughout its lifetime. in order to obtain each individual whistle sound, dolphins undergo vocal production learning. this consists of an experience with other dolphins that modifies the signal structure of an existing whistle sound. an auditory experience influences the whistle development of each dolphin. dolphins are able to communicate to one another by addressing another dolphin through mimicking their whistle. the signature whistle of a male bottlenose dolphin tends to be similar to that of his mother, while the signature whistle of a female bottlenose dolphin tends to be more distinguishing. bottlenose dolphins have a strong memory when it comes to these signature whistles, as they are able to relate to a signature whistle of an individual they have not encountered for over twenty years. research done on signature whistle usage by other dolphin species is relatively limited. the research on other species done so far has yielded varied outcomes and inconclusive results.because dolphins are generally associated in groups, communication is necessary. signal masking is when other similar sounds  in larger groups, individual whistle sounds are less prominent. dolphins tend to travel in pods, upon which there are groups of dolphins that range from a few to many. although they are traveling in these pods, the dolphins do not necessarily swim right next to each other. rather, they swim within the same general vicinity. in order to prevent losing one of their pod members, there are higher whistle rates. because their group members were spread out, this was done in order to continue traveling together.dolphins frequently leap above the water surface, this being done for various reasons. when travelling, jumping can save the dolphin energy as there is less friction while in the air. this type of travel is known as porpoising. other reasons include orientation, social displays, fighting, non-verbal communication, entertainment and attempting to dislodge parasites.dolphins show various types of playful behavior, often including objects, self-made bubble rings, other dolphins or other animals. when playing with objects or small animals, common behavior includes carrying the object or animal along using various parts of the body, passing it along to other members of the group or taking it from another member, or throwing it out of the water. dolphins have also been observed harassing animals in other ways, for example by dragging birds underwater without showing any intent to eat them. playful behaviour that involves another animal species with active participation of the other animal can also be observed however. playful human interaction with dolphins being the most obvious example, however playful interactions have been observed in the wild with a number of other species as well, such as humpback whales and dogs.juvenile dolphins off the coast of western australia have been observed chasing, capturing, and chewing on blowfish. while some reports state that the dolphins are becoming intoxicated on the tetrodotoxin in the fishes skin, other reports have characterized this behavior as the normal curiosity and exploration of their environment in which dolphins engage.dolphins are known to teach, learn, cooperate, scheme, and grieve. the neocortex of many species is home to elongated spindle neurons that, prior to 2007, were known only in hominids. in humans, these cells are involved in social conduct, emotions, judgment, and theory of mind. cetacean spindle neurons are found in areas of the brain that are homologous to where they are found in humans, suggesting that they perform a similar function.brain size was previously considered a major indicator of the intelligence of an animal. since most of the brain is used for maintaining bodily functions, greater ratios of brain to body mass may increase the amount of brain mass available for more complex cognitive tasks. allometric analysis indicates that mammalian brain size scales at approximately the  diabetes which may lead to a better understanding of the disease and new treatments for both humans and dolphins.dolphins can tolerate and recover from extreme injuries such as shark bites although the exact methods used to achieve this are not known. the healing process is rapid and even very deep wounds do not cause dolphins to hemorrhage to death. furthermore, even gaping wounds restore in such a way that the animals body shape is restored, and infection of such large wounds seems rare.a study published in the journal marine mammal science suggests that at least some dolphins survive shark attacks using everything from sophisticated combat moves to teaming up against the shark.some dolphin species are at risk of extinction, especially some river dolphin species such as the amazon river dolphin, and the ganges and yangtze river dolphin, which are critically or seriously endangered. a 2006 survey found no individuals of the yangtze river dolphin, which now appears to be functionally extinct.pesticides, heavy metals, plastics, and other industrial and agricultural pollutants that do not disintegrate rapidly in the environment concentrate in predators such as dolphins. injuries or deaths due to collisions with boats, especially their propellers, are also common.various fishing methods, most notably purse seine fishing for tuna and the use of drift and gill nets, unintentionally kill many dolphins. accidental by-catch in gill nets and incidental captures in antipredator nets that protect marine fish farms are common and pose a risk for mainly local dolphin populations. in some parts of the world, such as taiji in japan and the faroe islands, dolphins are traditionally considered food and are killed in harpoon or drive hunts. dolphin meat is high in mercury and may thus pose a health danger to humans when consumed.queenslands shark culling program, which has killed roughly 50,000 sharks since 1962, has also killed thousands of dolphins as bycatch. ""shark control"" programs in both queensland and new south wales use shark nets and drum lines, which entangle and kill dolphins. queenslands ""shark control"" program has killed more than 1,000 dolphins in recent years, and at least 32 dolphins have been killed in queensland since 2014. a shark culling program in kwazulu-natal has killed at least 2,310 dolphins.dolphin safe labels attempt to reassure consumers that fish and other marine products have been caught in a dolphin-friendly way. the earliest campaigns with ""dolphin safe"" labels were initiated in the 1980s as a result of cooperation between marine activists and the major tuna companies, and involved decreasing incidental dolphin kills by up to 50% by changing the type of nets used to catch tuna. the dolphins are netted only while fishermen are in pursuit of smaller tuna. albacore are not netted this way, making albacore the only truly dolphin-safe tuna.loud underwater noises, such as those resulting from naval sonar use, live firing exercises, and certain offshore construction projects such as wind farms, may be harmful to dolphins, increasing stress, damaging hearing, and causing decompression sickness by forcing them to surface too quickly to escape the noise.dolphins and other smaller cetaceans are also hunted in an activity known as dolphin drive hunting. this is accomplished by driving a pod together with boats and usually into a bay or onto a beach. their escape is prevented by closing off the route to the ocean with other boats or nets. dolphins are hunted this way in several places around the world, including the solomon islands, the faroe islands, peru, and japan, the most well-known practitioner of this method. by numbers, dolphins are mostly hunted for their meat, though some end up in dolphinariums. despite the controversial nature of the hunt resulting in international criticism, and the possible health risk that the often polluted meat causes, thousands of dolphins are caught in drive hunts each year.dolphins have long played a role in human culture. dolphins are sometimes used as symbols, for instance in heraldry.in greek myths, dolphins were seen invariably as helpers of humankind. dolphins also seem to have been important to the minoans, judging by artistic evidence from the ruined palace at knossos. during the 2009 excavations of a major mycenaean city at iklaina, a striking fragment of a wall-paintings came to light, depicting a ship with three human figures and dolphins. dolphins are common in greek mythology, and many coins from ancient greece have been found which feature a man, a boy or a deity riding on the back of a dolphin. the ancient greeks welcomed dolphins; spotting dolphins riding in a ships wake was considered a good omen. in both ancient and later art, cupid is often shown riding a dolphin. a dolphin rescued the poet arion from drowning and carried him safe to land, at cape matapan, a promontory forming the southernmost point of the peloponnesus. there was a temple to poseidon and a statue of arion riding the dolphin.the greeks reimagined the phoenician god melqart as melikert017. the killer whales intelligence, trainability, striking appearance, playfulness in captivity and sheer size have made it a popular exhibit at aquaria and aquatic theme parks. from 1976 to 1997, 55 whales were taken from the wild in iceland, 19 from japan, and three from argentina. these figures exclude animals that died during capture. live captures fell dramatically in the 1990s, and by 1999, about 40% of the 48 animals on display in the world were captive-born.organizations such as the mote marine laboratory rescue and rehabilitate sick, wounded, stranded or orphaned dolphins while others, such as the whale and dolphin conservation and hong kong dolphin conservation society, work on dolphin conservation and welfare. india has declared the dolphin as its national aquatic animal in an attempt to protect the endangered ganges river dolphin. the vikramshila gangetic dolphin sanctuary has been created in the ganges river for the protection of the animals.there is debate over the welfare of cetaceans in captivity, and often welfare can vary greatly dependent on the levels of care being provided at a particular facility. in the united states, facilities are regularly inspected by federal agencies to ensure that a high standard of welfare is maintained. additionally, facilities can apply to become accredited by the association of zoos and aquariums  captivity usually bears little resemblance to wild habitat, and captive whales social groups are foreign to those found in the wild. critics claim captive life is stressful due to these factors and the requirement to perform circus tricks that are not part of wild killer whale behavior. wild killer whales may travel up to 160 kilometres  captives occasionally act aggressively towards themselves, their tankmates, or humans, which critics say is a result of stress.although dolphins generally interact well with humans, some attacks have occurred, most of them resulting in small injuries. orcas, the largest species of dolphin, have been involved in fatal attacks on humans in captivity. the record-holder of documented orca fatal attacks is a male named tilikum, who lived at seaworld from 1992 until his death in 2017. tilikum has played a role in the death of three people in three different incidents  tilikums behaviour sparked the production of the documentary blackfish, which focuses on the consequences of keeping orcas in captivity. there are documented incidents in the wild, too, but none of them fatal.fatal attacks from other species are less common, but there is a registered occurrence off the coast of brazil in 1994, when a man died after being attacked by a bottlenose dolphin named ti000 the press reported that dolphins trained to kill by the soviet navy had been sold to iran.the military is also interested in disguising underwater communications as artificial dolphin clicks.dolphins are an increasingly popular choice of animal-assisted therapy for psychological problems and developmental disabilities. for example, a 2005 study found dolphins an effective treatment for mild to moderate depression. however, this study was criticized on several grounds. for example, it is not known whether dolphins are more effective than common pets. reviews of this and other published dolphin-assisted therapy in some parts of the world, such as taiji, japan and the faroe islands, dolphins are traditionally considered as food, and are killed in harpoon or drive hunts.dolphin meat is consumed in a small number of countries worldwide, which include japan and peru  while japan may be the best-known and most controversial example, only a very small minority of the population has ever sampled it.dolphin meat is dense and such a dark shade of red as to appear black. fat is located in a layer of blubber between the meat and the skin. when dolphin meat is eaten in japan, it is often cut into thin strips and eaten raw as sashimi, garnished with onion and either horseradish or grated garlic, much as with sashimi of whale or horse meat there have been human health concerns associated with the consumption of dolphin meat in japan after tests showed that dolphin meat contained high levels of mercury. there are no known cases of mercury poisoning as a result of consuming dolphin meat, though the government continues to monitor people in areas where dolphin meat consumption is high. the japanese government recommends that children and pregnant women avoid eating dolphin meat on a regular basis.similar concerns exist with the consumption of dolphin meat in the faroe islands, where prenatal exposure to methylmercury and pcbs primarily from the consumption of pilot whale meat has resulted in neuropsychological deficits amongst children.the faroe islands population was exposed to methylmercury largely from contaminated pilot whale meat, which contained very high levels of about 2 mg methylmercury/kg. however, the faroe islands populations also eat significant numbers of fish. the study of about 900 faroese children showed that prenatal exposure to methylmercury resulted in neuropsychological deficits at 7 years of ageconservation, research and news:photos:",1,0
"an alligator is a crocodilian in the genus alligator of the family alligatoridae. the two extant species are the american alligator the name ""alligator"" is probably an anglicized form of el lagarto, the spanish term for ""the lizard"", which early spanish explorers and settlers in florida called the alligator. later english spellings of the name included allagarta and alagarto.an average adult american alligators weight and length is 360.12 may 2020. another one of the oldest lives on record is that of muja, an american alligator who was brought as adult specimen to the belgrade zoo in serbia from germany in 1937. although no valid records exist about its date of birth, it is now in its 80s and possibly the oldest alligator living in captivity.alligators are native to only the united states, mexico, and china.american alligators are found in the southeast united states: all of florida and louisiana; the southern parts of georgia, alabama, and mississippi; coastal south and north carolina; east texas, the southeast corner of oklahoma, and the southern tip of arkansas. louisiana has the largest alligator population. the majority of american alligators inhabit florida and louisiana, with over a million alligators in each state. southern florida is the only place where both alligators and crocodiles live side by side. a small population is also found in tamaulipas, in mexico.american alligators live in freshwater environments, such as ponds, marshes, wetlands, rivers, lakes, and swamps, as well as in brackish water. when they construct alligator holes in the wetlands, they increase plant diversity and provide habitat for other animals during droughts.  they are, therefore, considered an important species for maintaining ecological diversity in wetlands. farther west, in louisiana, heavy grazing by coypu and muskrat are causing severe damage to coastal wetlands.  large alligators feed extensively on coypu, and provide a vital ecological service by reducing coypu numbers.the chinese alligator currently is found in only the yangtze river valley and parts of adjacent provinces and is extremely endangered, with only a few dozen believed to be left in the wild. indeed, far more chinese alligators live in zoos around the world than can be found in the wild. rockefeller wildlife refuge in southern louisiana has several in captivity in an attempt to preserve the species. miami metrozoo in florida also has a breeding pair of chinese alligators.large male alligators are solitary territorial animals. smaller alligators can often be found in large numbers close to each other. the largest of the species  alligators have also been observed to rise up and balance on their hind legs and semi-step forward as part of a forward or upward lunge. however, they can not walk on their hind legs.although the alligator has a heavy body and a slow metabolism, it is capable of short bursts of speed, especially in very short lunges. alligators main prey are smaller animals they can kill and eat with a single bite. they may kill larger prey by grabbing it and dragging it into the water to drown. alligators consume food that cannot be eaten in one bite by allowing it to rot or by biting and then performing a ""death roll"", spinning or convulsing wildly until bite-sized chunks are torn off. critical to the alligators ability to initiate a death roll, the tail must flex to a significant angle relative to its body. an alligator with an immobilized tail cannot perform a death roll.most of the muscle in an alligators jaw evolved to bite and grip prey. the muscles that close the jaws are powerful, but the muscles for opening their jaws are weak. as a result, an adult human can hold an alligators jaws shut bare-handed. it is common to use several wraps of duct tape to prevent an adult alligator from opening its jaws when being handled or transported.alligators are generally timid towards humans and tend to walk or swim away if one approaches. this may encourage people to approach alligators and their nests, which can provoke the animals into attacking. in florida, feeding wild alligators at any time is illegal. if fed, the alligators will eventually lose their fear of humans and will learn to associate humans with food.the type of food eaten by alligators depends upon their age and size. when young, alligators eat fish, insects, snails, crustaceans, and worms. as they mature, progressively larger prey is taken, including larger fish such as gar, turtles, and various mammals, particularly coypu and muskrat, as well as birds, deer, and other reptiles. their stomachs also often contain gizzard stones. they will even consume carrion if they are sufficiently hungry. in some cases, larger alligators are known to ambush dogs, florida panthers and black bears, making them the apex predator throughout their distribution. in this role as a top predator, it may determine the abundance of prey species, including turtles and coypu. as humans encroach into their habitat, attacks are few but not unknown. alligators, unlike the large crocodiles, do not immediately regard a human upon encounter as prey, but may still attack in self-defense if provoked.alligators generally mature at a length of 6010, on spring nights alligators were found to gather in large numbers for group courtship, the so-called ""alligator dances"".in summer, the female builds a nest of vegetation where the decomposition of the vegetation provides the heat needed to incubate the eggs. the sex of the offspring is determined by the temperature in the nest and is fixed within seven to 21 days of the start of incubation. incubation temperatures of 86\xb0f  the mother  defends the nest from predators and assists the hatchlings to water. she will provide protection to the young for about a year if they remain in the area. adult alligators regularly cannibalize younger individuals, though estimates of the rate of cannibalism vary widely. in the past, immediately following the outlawing of alligator hunting, populations rebounded quickly due to the suppressed number of adults preying upon juveniles, increasing survival among the young alligators.alligators, much like birds, have been shown to exhibit unidirectional movement of air through their lungs. most other amniotes are believed to exhibit bidirectional, or tidal breathing. for a tidal breathing animal, such as a mammal, air flows into and out of the lungs through branching bronchi which terminate in small dead-end chambers called alveoli. as the alveoli represent dead-ends to flow, the inspired air must move back out the same way it came in. in contrast, air in alligator lungs makes a circuit, moving in only one direction through the parabronchi. the air first enters the outer branch, moves through the parabronchi, and exits the lung through the inner branch. oxygen exchange takes place in extensive vasculature around the parabronchi.like other crocodilians, alligators have an armor of bony scutes. the dermal bones are highly vascularised and aid in calcium balance, both to neutralize acids while the animal cannot breathe underwater and to provide calcium for eggshell formation.alligators have muscular, flat tails that propel them while swimming.the two kinds of white alligators are albino and leucistic. these alligators are practically impossible to find in the wild. they could survive only in captivity and are few in number. the aquarium of the americas in new orleans has leucistic alligators found in a louisiana swamp in 1987.alligators are raised commercially for their meat and their skin, which when tanned is used for the manufacture of luggage, handbags, shoes, belts, and other leather items. alligators also provide economic benefits through the ecotourism industry. visitors may take swamp tours, in which alligators are a feature. their most important economic benefit to humans may be the control of coypu and muskrats.alligator meat is also consumed by humans.while there are rules of thumb for distinguishing alligators from crocodiles, all of them admit exceptions. such general rules include:alligator

"crocodiles  crocodiles have more webbing on the toes of the hind feet and can better tolerate saltwater due to specialized salt glands for filtering out salt, which are present, but non-functioning, in alligators. another trait that separates crocodiles from other crocodilians is their much higher levels of aggression.crocodile size, morphology, behaviour and ecology differ somewhat among species. however, they have many similarities in these areas as well. all crocodiles are semiaquatic and tend to congregate in freshwater habitats such as rivers, lakes, wetlands and sometimes in brackish water and saltwater. they are carnivorous animals, feeding mostly on vertebrates such as fish, reptiles, birds and mammals, and sometimes on invertebrates such as molluscs and crustaceans, depending on species and age. all crocodiles are tropical species that, unlike alligators, are very sensitive to cold. they separated from other crocodilians during the eocene epoch, about 55 million years ago. many species are at the risk of extinction, some being classified as critically endangered.the word ""crocodile"" comes from the ancient greek   found cited in many english reference works. in the koine greek of roman times, crocodilos and crocodeilos would have been pronounced identically, and either or both may be the source of the latinized form crocod0-metre  the extraordinary bite of crocodilians is a result of their anatomy. the space for the jaw muscle in the skull is very large, which is easily visible from the outside as a bulge at each side. the muscle is so stiff, it is almost as hard as bone to touch, as if it were the continuum of the skull. another trait is that most of the muscle in a crocodiles jaw is arranged for clamping down. despite the strong muscles to close the jaw, crocodiles have extremely small and weak muscles to open the jaw. crocodiles can thus be subdued for study or transport by taping their jaws or holding their jaws shut with large rubber bands cut from automobile inner tubes.crocodiles can move quickly over short distances, even out of water. the land speed record for a crocodile is 170010. crocworld conservation centre, in scottburgh, south africa, claims to have a male nile crocodile that was born in 1900. named henry, the crocodile is said to have lived in botswana along the okavango river, according to centre director martin rodrigues.crocodiles are the most social of reptiles. even though they do not form social groups, many species congregate in certain sections of rivers, tolerating each other at times of feeding and basking. most species are not highly territorial, with the exception of the saltwater crocodile, which is a highly territorial and aggressive species: a mature, male saltwater crocodile will not tolerate any other males at any time of the year, but most other species are more flexible. there is a certain form of hierarchy in crocodiles: the largest and heaviest males are at the top, having access to the best basking site, while females are priority during a group feeding of a big kill or carcass. a good example of the hierarchy in crocodiles would be the case of the nile crocodile. this species clearly displays all of these behaviours. studies in this area are not thorough, however, and many species are yet to be studied in greater detail. mugger crocodiles are also known to show toleration in group feedings and tend to congregate in certain areas. however, males of all species are aggressive towards each other during mating season, to gain access to females.crocodiles are also the most vocal of all reptiles, producing a wide variety of sounds during various situations and conditions, depending on species, age, size and sex. depending on the context, some species can communicate over 20 different messages through vocalizations alone. some of these vocalizations are made during social communication, especially during territorial displays towards the same sex and courtship with the opposite sex; the common concern being reproduction. therefore most conspecific vocalization is made during the breeding season, with the exception being year-round territorial behaviour in some species and quarrels during feeding. crocodiles also produce different distress calls and in aggressive displays to their own kind and other animals; notably other predators during interspecific predatory confrontations over carcasses and terrestrial kills.specific vocalisations include015 study, crocodiles engage in all three main types of play behaviour recorded in animals: locomotor play, play with objects and social play. play with objects is reported most often, but locomotor play such as repeatedly sliding down slopes, and social play such as riding on the backs of other crocodiles is also reported. this behaviour was exhibited with conspecifics and mammals and is apparently not uncommon, though has been difficult to observe and interpret in the past due to obvious dangers of interacting with large carnivores.most species are grouped into the genus crocodylus. the other extant genus, osteolaemus, is monotypic  many extinct species of crocodylus might represent different genera. ""crocodylus"" pigotti, for example, was placed in the newly erected genus brochuchus in 2013. c. suchus was not included because its morphological codings were identical to those of c. niloticus. however, the authors suggested that the lack of differences was due to limited specimen sampling, and considered the two species to be distinct. this analysis found weak support for the clade osteolaeminae. brochu named osteolaeminae in 2003 as a subfamily of crocodylidae separate from crocodylinae, but the group has since been classified within crocodylinae. it includes the living genus osteolaemus as well as the extinct species voay robustus and rimasuchus lloydi.013 analysis by jack l. conrad, kirsten jenkins, thomas lehmann, and others did not support osteolaeminae as a true clade but rather a paraphyletic group consisting of two smaller clades. they informally called these clades ""osteolaemins"" and ""mecistopins"". ""osteolaemins"" include osteolaemus, voay, rimasuchus, and brochuchus and ""mecistopins"" include mecistops and euthecodon.the larger species of crocodiles are very dangerous to humans, mainly because of their ability to strike before the person can react. the saltwater crocodile and nile crocodile are the most dangerous, killing hundreds of people each year in parts of southeast asia and africa. the mugger crocodile and american crocodile are also dangerous to humans.crocodiles are protected in many parts of the world, but are also farmed commercially. their hides are tanned and used to make leather goods such as shoes and handbags; crocodile meat is also considered a delicacy. the most commonly farmed species are the saltwater and nile crocodiles, while a hybrid of the saltwater and the rare siamese crocodile is also bred in asian farms. farming has resulted in an increase in the saltwater crocodile population in australia, as eggs are usually harvested from the wild, so landowners have an incentive to conserve their habitat. crocodile leather can be made into goods such as wallets, briefcases, purses, handbags, belts, hats, and shoes. crocodile oil has been used for various purposes. crocodiles were eaten by vietnamese while they were taboo and off limits for chinese. vietnamese women who married chinese men adopted the chinese taboo.crocodile meat is consumed in some countries, such as australia, ethiopia, thailand, south africa, china and also cuba  cuts of meat include backstrap and tail fillet.due to high demand for crocodile products, traffic states that 1,418,487 nile crocodile skins were exported from africa between 2006 and 2015.crocodiles have appeared in various forms in religions across the world. ancient egypt had sobek, the crocodile-headed god, with his cult-city crocodilopolis, as well as taweret, the goddess of childbirth and fertility, with the back and tail of a crocodile. the jukun shrine in the wukari federation, nigeria is dedicated to crocodiles in thanks for their aid during migration. in madagascar various peoples such as the sakalava and antandroy see crocodiles as ancestor spirits and under local fady often offer them food; in the case of the latter at least a crocodile features prominently as an ancestor deity.crocodiles appear in different forms in hinduism. varuna, a vedic and hindu god, rides a part-crocodile makara; his consort varuni rides a crocodile. similarly the goddess personifications of the ganga and yamuna rivers are often depicted as riding crocodiles. also in india, in goa, crocodile worship is practised, including the annual mannge thapnee ceremony.in latin america, cipactli was the giant earth crocodile of the aztec and other nahua peoples.the term ""crocodile tears""  the story is repeated in bestiaries such as de bestiis et aliis rebus. this tale was first spread widely in english in the stories of the travels of sir john mandeville in the 14th century, and appears in several of shakespeares plays. in fact, crocodiles can and do generate tears, but they do not actually cry.the name of surabaya, indonesia, is locally believed to be derived from the words ""suro"" another source alludes to a jayabaya prophecyth-century psychic king of kediri kingdom93. the two animals are now used as the citys symbol, with the two facing and circling each other, as depicted in a statue appropriately located near the entrance to the city zoo ",1,0
"mercedes-benz  is both a german automotive marque and, from late 2019 onwards, a subsidiary 6 as daimler-benz. in 2018, mercedes-benz was the largest seller of premium vehicles in the world, having sold 2.31 million passenger cars.the companys origins come from daimler-motoren-gesellschafts 1901 mercedes and karl benzs 1886 benz patent-motorwagen, which is widely regarded as the first internal combustion engine in a self-propelled automobile. the fuel was not gasoline, but rather a much more volatile petroleum spirit called ligroin. the slogan for the brand is ""the best or nothing"".mercedes-benz traces its origins to karl benzs creation of the first internal combustion engine in a car, the benz patent motorwagen, financed by bertha benzs dowry and patented in january 1886, and gottlieb daimler and engineer wilhelm maybachs conversion of a stagecoach by the addition of a petrol engine later that year. the mercedes automobile was first marketed in 1901 by daimler-motoren-gesellschaft  the first mercedes-benz brand name vehicles were produced in 1926, following the merger of karl benzs and gottlieb daimlers companies into the daimler-benz company on 28 june of the same year.gottlieb daimler was born on 17 march 1834 in schorndorf. after training as a gunsmith and working in france, he attended the polytechnic school in stuttgart from 1857 to 1859. after completing various technical activities in france and england, he started working as a draftsman in geislingen in 1862. at the end of 1863, he was appointed workshop inspector in a machine tool factory in reutlingen, where he met wilhelm maybach in 1865.throughout the 1930s, mercedes-benz produced the 770 model, a car that was popular during germanys nazi period. adolf hitler was known to have been driven in these cars during his time in power, with bulletproof windshields. most of the surviving models have been sold at auctions to private buyers. one of them is currently on display at the war museum in ottawa, ontario. the pontiffs popemobile has often been sourced from mercedes-benz.from 1937 onwards, daimler benz focused increasingly on military products, such as the lg3000 lorry and the db600 and db601 aero engines. to build the latter, in 1936 it built a factory hidden in the forest at genshagen 10 it had virtually stopped making cars, and was entirely devoted to the war effort. according to its own statement, in 1944 almost half of its 63,610 employees were forced labourers, prisoners of war or concentration camp detainees. another source places this figure at 46,000 forced labourers working in daimler-benzs factories to bolster nazi war efforts. the company later paid $12 million in reparations to the labourers families.mercedes-benz has introduced many technological and safety innovations that later became common in other vehicles. mercedes-benz is one of the best-known and established automotive brands in the world.in november 2019, daimler ag announced that mercedes-benz, up until that point a company marque, would be spun off into a separate wholly owned subsidiary called mercedes-benz ag. the new subsidiary would manage the mercedes-benzs car and van business. mercedes-benz-badged trucks and buses would be part of the daimler truck ag subsidiary.for information relating to the famous three-pointed star, see under the title daimler-motoren-gesellschaft, including the merger into daimler-benz.as part of the daimler ag company, the mercedes-benz cars division includes mercedes-benz and smart car production.mercedes-amg became a majority owned division of mercedes-benz in 1999.  the company was integrated into daimlerchrysler in 1999, and became mercedes-benz amg beginning on 1 january 1999.daimlers ultra-luxury maybach brand was under the mercedes-benz cars division until december 2012, when production was stopped due to poor sales volumes. it now exists under the mercedes-maybach name, with the models being ultra-luxury versions of mercedes-benz cars, such as the 2016 mercedes-maybach s600. in november 2019, the mercedes-maybach gls 600 suv debuted.daimler cooperates with byd auto to make and sell a battery-electric car called denza in china. in 2016, daimler announced plans to sell mercedes-benz branded all-electric battery cars in china. beijing benz is a joint venture with baic group to produce mercedes-benz branded cars in china. in 2018, mercedes-benz apologized for inciting controversy in china by quoting the dalai lama on an instagram post.beside its native germany, mercedes-benz vehicles are also manufactured or assembled in:since its inception, mercedes-benz has maintained a reputation for its quality and durability. objective measures looking at passenger vehicles, such as j. d. power surveys, demonstrated a downturn in reputation in these criteria in the late 1990s and early 2000s. by mid-2005, mercedes temporarily returned to the industry average for initial quality, a measure of problems after the first 90007, mercedes showed dramatic improvement by climbing from 25th to 5th place and earning several awards for its models. for 2008, mercedes-benzs initial quality rating improved by yet another mark, to fourth place.  on top of this accolade, it also received the platinum plant quality award for its mercedes011 us initial quality and vehicle dependability studies both ranked mercedes-benz vehicles above average in build quality and reliability. in the 2011 uk j. d. power survey, mercedes cars were rated above average. a 2014 iseecars.com study for reuters found mercedes to have the lowest vehicle recall rate.mercedes-benz offers a full range of passenger, light commercial and heavy commercial equipment. vehicles are manufactured in multiple countries worldwide. the smart marque of city cars are also produced by daimler ag.mercedes-benz produces a range of vans; citan, vito, and sprintermercedes-benz trucks is now part of the daimler trucks division and includes companies that were part of the daimlerchrysler merger. gottlieb daimler sold the worlds first truck in 1886. the first factory to be built outside germany after wwii was in argentina. it originally built trucks, many of which were modified independently to buses, popularly named colectivo. today, it builds buses, trucks, the vito and the sprinter van.mercedes-benz has been making buses since 1895 in mannheim in germany. since 1995, the brand of mercedes-benz buses and coaches is under the umbrella of evobus gmbh, belonging 100% to the daimler ag. mercedes-benz produces a wide range of buses and coaches, mainly for europe and asia. the first model was produced by karl benz in 1895.the mercedes-benz 600 or 600s pullman guard limousines offer the option of armour-plating and have been used by diplomats worldwide.until 1994, mercedes-benz utilized an alphanumeric system for categorizing their vehicles, consisting of a number sequence approximately equal to the engines displacement in liters multiplied by 100, followed by an arrangement of alphabetical suffixes, indicating body style and engine type.some models in the 1950s also had lower-case letters  the changes consolidate many confusing nomenclature and their placements in the model range such as cl-class is now called the s-class coup016, mercedes unveiled the x-class; a pickup truck built on the nissan navara. at the 2016 paris motor show, the company announced the eq, a family of upcoming battery electric vehicles based on a modular platform, expected to represent up to 25% of its global sales by 2025.note: the cla is positioned between the a- and b-class models, while the cls sits between the e- and s-classes.in addition to the revised nomenclature, mercedes-benz has new nomenclature for the drive systems.cdigla 200 delectric driveb 250 ebluetec hybride 300 hthe revised a45 amg for 2016 model year on has shifted the model designation to the right side while amg is on the left side. this trend commenced with mercedes-maybach with maybach on the left and s500/s600 on the right.mercedes-benz has developed multi-concept cars with alternative propulsion, such as hybrid-electric, fully electric, and fuel-cell powertrains. at the 2007 frankfurt motor show, mercedes-benz showed seven hybrid models, including the f700 concept car, powered by a hybrid-electric drivetrain featuring the diesotto engine. in 2009, mercedes-benz displayed three bluezero concepts at the north american international auto show. each car features a different powertrain - battery-electric, fuel-cell electric, and gasoline-electric hybrid. in the same year, mercedes also showed the vision s500 phev concept with a 19 miles since 2002, mercedes-benz has developed the f-cell fuel cell vehicle. the current version, based on the b-class, has a 250-mile range and is available for lease, with volume production scheduled to begin in 2014. mercedes has also announced the sls amg e-cell, a fully electric version of the sls sports car, with deliveries expected in 2013. the mercedes-benz s400 bluehybrid was launched in 2009, and is the first production automotive hybrid in the world to use a lithium-ion battery. in mid-2010, production commenced on the vito e-cell all-electric van.in 2008, mercedes-benz announced that it would have a demonstration fleet of small electric cars in two to three years. mercedes-benz and smart are preparing for the widespread uptake of electric vehicles in the united states, mercedes-benz was assessed a record us$30.66009. certain mercedes-benz cars, including the s550 and all amg models sold in the united states, also face an additional gas guzzler tax. however, newer amg models fitted with the m157 engine will not be subject to the gas-guzzler tax, due to improved fuel economy, and newer models powered by the m276 and m278 engines will have better fuel economy. in 2008, mercedes also had the worst co2 average of all major european manufacturers, ranking 14th out of 14 manufacturers. mercedes was also the worst manufacturer in 2007 and 2006 in terms of average co2 levels, with 181 emitted per km, respectively.mercedes-benz paid an additional us$38 million for failing to meet its cafe standards for model years 2008011.in may 2017, mercedes partnered with vivint solar to develop a solar-energy home storage battery.in february 2018, it was announced that mercedes cabin air filters earned the asthma and allergy friendly certification.mercedes is to open its sixth battery factory in 2018, which makes it a tough competitor to tesla, inc. the six factories will be established across 3 continents.the brand has also planned to launch its electric eq brand with the eqc suv being set for production in the year 2019. in september 2018, mercedes unveiled the eqc, its first fully electric car, at an event in stockholm.2022 will be the year in which daimler has said that the company will have invested $11 billion to ensure that every mercedes-benz has a fully electric or hybrid version available on the market.while releasing details of the project, markus sch025, the owner of mercedes-benz announced that the company will shed around 10,000 jobs worldwide to focus on electric cars.the two companies which were merged to form the mercedes-benz brand in 1926 had both already enjoyed success in the new sport of motor racing throughout their separate histories. a single benz competed in the worlds first motor race, the 1894 paris008, as well as a constructors championship in 1998. mercedes part-owned mclaren, and the collaboration had been extended into the production of road-going cars such as the mercedes-benz slr mclaren.in 2007, mclaren-mercedes was fined a record us$100009, ross brawns newly conceived formula one team, brawn gp used mercedes engines to help win the constructors championship, and jenson button to become drivers champion. at the end of the season, mercedes-benz sold its 40% stake in mclaren to the mclaren group and bought 70% of the brawn gp team jointly with an abu dhabi-based investment consortium. brawn gp was renamed mercedes gp for the 2010 season and became the main team for mercedes-benz. the company continued providing engines to other teams under customer relationships.after major rule changes in 2014, mercedes clinched the constructors title with drivers lewis hamilton and nico rosberg, after dominating much of the season. mercedes repeated the feat in 2015, winning 16 out of 19 races, and again in 2016, winning 19 of the 21 races. in the next four years, mercedes continued their success by winning constructors championships in 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020 for a total of seven consecutive titles. in these seven years, hamilton won the drivers title in 2014, 2015, 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020 while rosberg won in 2016. they are the only formula one team to ever win seven consecutive ""double-championships"".prior to pre-season testing of the 2019-20 formula e championship, it was announced that mercedes, through its eq branch, would join the championship with drivers stoffel vandoorne and 2019 fia formula 2 season champion nyck de vries. the team named their spark gen2 challenger the mercedes eq silver arrow 01.in june 1909, daimler-motoren-gesellschaft 190261926007 what

"see textcolumbidae /k0. columbidae is the only living family in the order columbiformes. the sandgrouse the columbidae are usually divided into five subfamilies, probably inaccurately. for example, the american ground and quail doves  the order presented here follows baptista et2020 study found that the east coast of the u.s. includes two pigeon genetic megacities, in new york and boston, and they dont mix.male pigeons are more opportunistic to mate with another female.seeds and fruit form the major component of the diets of pigeons and doves. in fact, the family can be divided into the seed-eating or granivorous species  the granivorous species typically feed on seed found on the ground, whereas the frugivorous species tend to feed in trees. there are morphological adaptations that can be used to distinguish between the two groups: granivores tend to have thick walls in their gizzards, intestines, and esophagi whereas the frugivores tend to have thin walls. in addition, fruit-eating species have short intestines whereas those that eat seeds have longer ones. frugivores are capable of clinging to branches and even hang upside down to reach fruit.in addition to fruit and seeds, a number of other food items are taken by many species. some, particularly the ground doves and quail-doves, eat a large number of prey items such as insects and worms. one species, the atoll fruit dove, is specialised in taking insect and reptile prey. snails, moths, and other insects are taken by white-crowned pigeons, orange fruit doves, and ruddy ground doves.while many species of pigeons and doves have benefited from human activities and have increased their ranges, many other species have declined in numbers and some have become threatened or even succumbed to extinction. among the ten species to have become extinct since 1600 the passenger pigeon was exceptional for a number of reasons. in modern times, it is the only pigeon species that was not an island species to have become extinct even though it was once the most numerous species of bird on earth. its former numbers are difficult to estimate, but one ornithologist, alexander wilson, estimated one flock he observed contained over two billion birds. the decline of the species was abrupt; in 1871, a breeding colony was estimated to contain over a hundred million birds, yet the last individual in the species was dead by 1914. although habitat loss was a contributing factor, the species is thought to have been massively over-hunted, being used as food for slaves and, later, the poor, in the united states throughout the 19th, driven to extinction by habitat loss and introduced feral cats. in some areas, a lack of knowledge means the true status of a species is unknown; the negros fruit dove has not been seen since 1953, and may or may not be extinct, and the polynesian ground dove is classified as critically endangered, as whether it survives or not on remote islands in the far west of the pacific ocean is unknown.various conservation techniques are employed to prevent these extinctions, including laws and regulations to control hunting pressure, the establishment of protected areas to prevent further habitat loss, the establishment of captive populations for reintroduction back into the wild the pigeon was used in both world war i and ii, notably by the australian, french, german, american, and uk forces. they were also awarded with various laurels throughout, for their service. on 2 december 1943, three pigeons\xa0ii. thirty-two pigeons have been decorated with the dickin medal, citing them for ""brave service"", for war contributions, including commando, g.i. joe, paddy, royal blue, and william of orange.cher ami, a homing pigeon in world war i, was awarded the croix de guerre medal, by france, with a palm oak leaf cluster for her service in verdun. despite having almost lost a leg and being shot in the chest, she managed to travel around twenty-five miles to deliver the message that saved 194 men of the lost battalion of the 77th infantry division in the battle of the argonne, in october 1918. when cher ami died, she was mounted and is part of the permanent exhibit at the national museum of american history of the smithsonian institution.a grand ceremony was held in buckingham palace to commemorate a platoon of pigeons that braved the battlefields of normandy to deliver vital plans to allied forces on the fringes of germany. three of the actual birds that received the medals are on show in the london military museum so that well-wishers can pay their respects.the rock pigeon has been domesticated for hundreds of years. it has been bred into several varieties kept by hobbyists, of which the best known is the homing pigeon or racing homer. other popular breeds are tumbling pigeons such as the birmingham roller, and fancy varieties that are bred for certain physical characteristics such as large feathers on the feet or fan-shaped tails. domesticated rock pigeons are also bred as carrier pigeons, used for thousands of years to carry brief written messages, and release doves used in ceremonies. white doves are also commonly used in magic acts.in ancient mesopotamia, doves were prominent animal symbols of inanna-ishtar, the goddess of love, sexuality, and war. doves are shown on cultic objects associated with inanna as early as the beginning of the third millennium bc. lead dove figurines were discovered in the temple of ishtar at a\xc5\xa1\xc5\xa1ur, dating to the thirteenth century bc, and a painted fresco from mari, syria, shows a giant dove emerging from a palm tree in the temple of ishtar, indicating that the goddess herself was sometimes believed to take the form of a dove. in the epic of gilgamesh, utnapishtim releases a dove and a raven to find land; the dove merely circles and returns. only then does utnapishtim send forth the raven, which does not return, and utnapishtim concludes the raven has found land.in the ancient levant, doves were used as symbols for the canaanite mother goddess asherah. the ancient greek word for ""dove"" was perister\xc3\xa1, which may be derived from the semitic phrase pera\xe1\xb8\xa5 i\xc5\xa1tar, meaning ""bird of ishtar"". in classical antiquity, doves were sacred to the greek goddess aphrodite, who absorbed this association with doves from inanna-ishtar. aphrodite frequently appears with doves in ancient greek pottery. the temple of aphrodite pandemos on the southwest slope of the athenian acropolis was decorated with relief sculptures of doves with knotted fillets in their beaks and votive offerings of small, white, marble doves were discovered in the temple of aphrodite at daphni. during aphrodites main festival, the aphrodisia, her altars would be purified with the blood of a sacrificed dove. aphrodites associations with doves influenced the roman goddesses venus and fortuna, causing them to become associated with doves as well.in the hebrew bible, doves or young pigeons are acceptable burnt offerings for those who cannot afford a more expensive animal. in genesis, noah sends a dove out of the ark, but it came back to him because the floodwaters had not receded. seven days later, he sent it again and it came back with an olive branch in her mouth, indicating the waters had receded enough for an olive tree to grow. ""dove"" is also a term of endearment in the song of songs and elsewhere. in hebrew, jonah  the ""sign of jonas"" in  is related to the ""sign of the dove"".jesuss parents sacrificed doves on his behalf after his circumcision  later, the holy spirit descended upon jesus at his baptism like a dove in islam, doves and the pigeon family in general are respected and favoured because they are believed to have assisted the final prophet of islam, muhammad, in distracting his enemies outside the cave of thawr, in the great hijra. a pair of pigeons had built a nest and laid eggs at once, and a spider had woven cobwebs, which in the darkness of the night made the fugitives believe that muhammad could not be in that cave.several species of pigeons and doves are used as food; however, all types are edible. domesticated or hunted pigeons have been used as the source of food since the times of the ancient middle east, ancient rome, and medieval europe. it is familiar meat within jewish, arab, and french cuisines. according to the tanakh, doves are kosher, and they are the only birds that may be used for a korban. other kosher birds may be eaten, but not brought as a korban. pigeon is also used in asian cuisines, such as chinese, assamese, and indonesian cuisines.in europe, the wood pigeon is commonly shot as a game bird, while rock pigeons were originally domesticated as a food species, and many breeds were developed for their meat-bearing qualities. the extinction of the passenger pigeon in north america was at least partly due to shooting for use as food. mrs beetons book of household management contains recipes for roast pigeon and pigeon pie, a popular, inexpensive food in victorian industrial britain.",1,0
"slavery and enslavement are the state and condition of being a slave, who is someone forbidden to quit their service for another person and is treated like property.  slavery relies heavily on the enslaved person being intimidated either by the threat of violence or some other method of abuse. in chattel slavery, the enslaved person is legally rendered the personal property  in the course of human history, slavery was often a feature of civilisation and legal in most societies, but is now outlawed in all countries of the world, except as punishment for crime.in 2019, approximately 40 million people, of whom 26 percent were children, were enslaved throughout the world despite it being illegal. in the modern world, more than 50 percent of enslaved people provide forced labor, usually in the factories and sweatshops of the private sector of a countrys economy. in the industrialised countries, human trafficking is the modern variety of slavery; in the unindustrialised countries, enslavement by debt bondage is a common form of enslaving a person, such as captive domestic servants, forced marriage, and child soldiers.the word slave is derived from the ethnonym  it arrived in english via the old french sclave. in medieval latin the word was sclavus and in byzantine greek . use of the word arose during the early medieval period, when slavs from central and eastern europe  an older interpretation connected slave to the greek verb skyle007, human rights watch estimated that 200,000 to 300,000 children served as soldiers in current conflicts. more girls under 16 work as domestic workers than any other category of child labor, often sent to cities by parents living in rural poverty such as in restaveks in haiti.forced marriages or early marriages are often considered types of slavery. forced marriage continues to be practiced in parts of the world including some parts of asia and africa and in immigrant communities in the west. sacred prostitution is where girls and women are pledged to priests or those of higher castes, such as the practice of devadasi in south asia or fetish slaves in west africa. marriage by abduction occurs in many places in the world today, with a national average of 69% of marriages in ethiopia being through abduction.economists have attempted to model the circumstances under which slavery  thus, first slavery and then serfdom gradually decreased in europe as the population grew but were reintroduced in the americas and in russia as large areas of new land with few people became available.slavery is more common when the labor done is relatively simple and thus easy to supervise, such as large-scale growing of a single crop, like sugar and cotton, in which output was based on economies of scale. this enables such systems of labor, such as the gang system in the united states, to become prominent on large plantations where field hands were monitored and worked with factory-like precision. for example, each work gang was based on an internal division of labour that assigned every member of the gang to a precise task and simultaneously made their own performance dependent on the actions of the others. the hoe hands chopped out the weeds that surrounded the cotton plants as well as excessive sprouts. the plow gangs followed behind, stirring the soil near the rows of cotton plants and tossing it back around the plants. thus, the gang system worked like an assembly line.since the 18th century, critics have argued that slavery tends to retard technological advancement because the focus is on increasing the number of slaves doing simple tasks rather than upgrading the efficiency of labour. for example, it is sometime argued that, because of this narrow focus, theoretical knowledge and learning in greece 007 were $91.2007 was $3,175, with a low of an average $950 for bonded labor and $29,210 for a trafficked sex slave. approximately 40% of slave profits each year are generated by trafficked sex slaves, representing slightly more than 4% of the worlds 295% or more of the population of ancient rome was enslaved, although the actual percentage is debated by scholars and varied from region to region. slaves represented 155% of italys population, mostly captives in war, especially from gaul and epirus. estimates of the number of slaves in the roman empire suggest that the majority of slaves were scattered throughout the provinces outside of italy. generally, slaves in italy were indigenous italians, with a minority of foreigners  the average recorded age at death for the slaves of the city of rome was seventeen and a half years slavery was widespread in africa, with both internal and external slave trade. in the senegambia region, between 1300 and 1900, close to one-third of the population was enslaved. in early islamic states of the western sahel, including ghana, mali, segou, and songhai, about a third of the population were enslaved.the arab slave trade, across the sahara desert and across the indian ocean, began after muslim arab and swahili traders won control of the swahili coast and sea routes during the 9th century  there, the slaves gradually assimilated in the rural areas, particularly on the unguja and pemba islands.slavery in mexico can be traced back to the aztecs. other amerindians, such as the inca of the andes, the tupinamb,000 years ago. slavery has been described as ""very important in medieval korea, probably more important than in any other east asian country, but by the 16th century, population growth was making  unnecessary"". slavery went into decline around the 10th century but came back in the late goryeo period when korea also experienced a number of slave rebellions.in the joseon period of korea, members of the slave class were known as nobi. the nobi were socially indistinct from freemen  while some scholars describe them as serfs. the nobi population could fluctuate up to about one-third of the population, but on average the nobi made up about 10% of the total population. in 1801, the vast majority of government nobi were emancipated, and by 1858 the nobi population stood at about 1.5 percent of the total population of korea.slavery largely disappeared from western europe in the middle ages but persisted longer in eastern europe. large-scale trading in slaves was mainly confined to the south and east of early medieval europe: the byzantine empire and the muslim world were the destinations, while pagan central and eastern europe  the trade in european slaves reached a peak in the 10th century following the zanj rebellion which dampened the use of african slaves in the arab world.slavery in early medieval europe was so common that the catholic church repeatedly prohibited it, or at least the export of christian slaves to non-christian lands, as for example at the council of koblenz  and the council of armagh  the approval of slavery under these conditions was reaffirmed and extended in his romanus pontifex bull of 1455.in britain, slavery continued to be practiced following the fall of rome, and sections of hywel the goods laws dealt with slaves in medieval wales. the trade particularly picked up after the viking invasions, with major markets at chester and bristol supplied by danish, mercian, and welsh raiding of one anothers borderlands. at the time of the domesday book, nearly 10% of the english population were slaves. william the conqueror introduced a law preventing the sale of slaves overseas. according to historian john gillingham, by 1200 slavery in the british isles was non-existent.slavery had never been authorized by statute within england and wales, and in 1772, in the case somerset v stewart, lord mansfield declared that it was also unsupported within england by the common law. the slave trade was abolished by the slave trade act 1807, although slavery remained legal in possessions outside europe until the passage of the slavery abolition act 1833 and the indian slavery act, 1843.however, when england began to have colonies in the americas, and particularly from the 1640s, african slaves began to make their appearance in england and remained a presence until the eighteenth century. in scotland, slaves continued to be sold as chattels until late in the eighteenth century for nearly two hundred years in the history of coal mining in scotland, miners were bonded to their ""maisters"" by a 1606 act ""anent coalyers and salters"". the colliers and salters the byzantine-ottoman wars and the ottoman wars in europe brought large numbers of slaves into the islamic world. to staff its bureaucracy, the ottoman empire established a janissary system which seized hundreds of thousands of christian boys through the dev6, when the system ended.after the battle of lepanto, 12,000 christian galley slaves were recaptured and freed from the ottoman fleet. eastern europe suffered a series of tatar invasions, the goal of which was to loot and capture slaves into jasyr. seventy-five crimean tatar raids were recorded into poland, black african slaves made up 10% of the population of lisbon. in the second half of the 16th century, the crown gave up the monopoly on slave trade, and the focus of european trade in african slaves shifted from import to europe to slave transports directly to tropical colonies in the americas3, when peter the great converted the household slaves into house serfs. russian agricultural slaves were formally converted into serfs earlier in 1679.in scandinavia, thralldom was abolished in the mid-14th century.the arab slave trade lasted more than a millennium. as recently as the early 1960s, saudi arabias slave population was estimated at 300,000. along with yemen, the saudis abolished slavery in 1962. historically, slaves in the arab world came from many different regions, including sub-saharan africa  the caucasus  central asia some historians assert that as many as 17 million people, was concentrated in the territories of the sokoto caliphate. the use of slave labor was extensive, especially in agriculture."" the anti-slavery society estimated there were 2550 years period:there are no records of how many men, women and children were enslaved, but it is possible to calculate roughly the number of fresh captives that would have been needed to keep populations steady and replace those slaves who died, escaped, were ransomed, or converted to islam. on this basis it is thought that around 8,500 new slaves were needed annually to replenish numbers 50 years between 1530 and 1780, the figure could easily have been as high as 1,250,000.davis numbers have been refuted by other historians, such as david earle, who cautions that true picture of europeans slaves is clouded by the fact the corsairs also seized non-christian whites from eastern europe. in addition, the number of slaves traded was hyperactive, with exaggerated estimates relying on peak years to calculate averages for entire centuries, or millennia.  hence, there were wide fluctuations year-to-year, particularly in the 18th and 19th centuries, given slave imports, and also given the fact that, prior to the 1840s, there are no consistent records.  middle east expert, john wright, cautions that modern estimates are based on back-calculations from human observation. such observations, across the late 16th and early 17th century observers, account for around 35,000 european christian slaves held throughout this period on the barbary coast, across tripoli, tunis, but mostly in algiers. the majority were sailors  this eventually led to the bombardment of algiers by an anglo-dutch fleet in 1816.under omani arabs, zanzibar became east africas main slave port, with as many as 50,000 enslaved africans passing through every year during the 19th century. some historians estimate that between 11 and 182 campaign in the southern nuba mountains, nearly 40,000 slaves were captured. however, through bad treatment, disease and desert travel barely 5,000 made it to egypt.."" w.a. veenhoven wrote: ""the german doctor, gustav nachtigal, an eye-witness, believed that for every slave who arrived at a market three or four died on the way7,000 blacks and 26,000 whites. by 1666, at least 12,000 white smallholders had been bought out, died, or left the island. many of the remaining whites were increasingly poor. by 1680, there were 17 slaves for every indentured servant. by 1700, there were 15,000 free whites and 50,000 enslaved africans.because of the increased implementation of slave codes, which created differential treatment between africans and the white workers and ruling planter class, the island became increasingly unattractive to poor whites. black or slave codes were implemented in 1661, 1676, 1682, and 1688. in response to these codes, several slave rebellions were attempted or planned during this time, but none succeeded. nevertheless, poor whites who had or acquired the means to emigrate often did so. planters expanded their importation of enslaved africans to cultivate sugar cane.slavery in brazil began long before the first portuguese settlement was established in 1532, as members of one tribe would enslave captured members of another.later, portuguese colonists were heavily dependent on indigenous labor during the initial phases of settlement to maintain the subsistence economy, and natives were often captured by expeditions called bandeiras. the importation of african slaves began midway through the 16th century, but the enslavement of indigenous peoples continued well into the 17th and 18th centuries.during the atlantic slave trade era, brazil imported more african slaves than any other country. nearly 51st century.in 1789 the spanish crown led an effort to reform slavery, as the demand for slave labor in cuba was growing. the crown issued a decree, c5 and required the whippings ""not to cause serious bruises or bleeding"". the slave-owners thought that the slaves would interpret these limits as weaknesses, ultimately leading to resistance. another contested issue was the work hours that were restricted ""from sunrise to sunset""; plantation owners responded by explaining that cutting and processing of cane needed 20-hour days during the harvest season.those slaves who worked on sugar plantations and in sugar mills were often subject to the harshest of conditions. the field work was rigorous manual labor which the slaves began at an early age. the work days lasted close to 20 hours during harvest and processing, including cultivating and cutting the crops, hauling wagons, and processing sugarcane with dangerous machinery. the slaves were forced to reside in barracoons, where they were crammed in and locked in by a padlock at night, getting about three to four hours of sleep.  the conditions of the barracoons were harsh; they were highly unsanitary and extremely hot. typically there was no ventilation; the only window was a small barred hole in the wall.cubas slavery system was gendered in a way that some duties were performed only by male slaves, some only by female slaves. female slaves in havana from the 16th century onwards performed duties such as operating the town taverns, eating houses, and lodges, as well as being laundresses and domestic laborers and servants. female slaves also served as the town prostitutes.some cuban women could gain freedom by having children with white men. as in other latin cultures, there were looser borders with the mulatto or mixed-race population. sometimes men who took slaves as wives or concubines freed both them and their children. as in new orleans and saint-domingue, mulattos began to be classified as a third group between the european colonists and african slaves. freedmen, generally of mixed race, came to represent 20% of the total cuban population and 41% of the non-white cuban population.planters encouraged afro-cuban slaves to have children in order to reproduce their work force. the masters wanted to pair strong and large-built black men with healthy black women. they were placed in the barracoons and forced to have sex and create offspring of . the practice was devastating to the native population. following the indigenous ta5, the economy of haiti  many slaves died from diseases such as smallpox and typhoid fever. they had birth rates around 3 percent, and there is evidence that some women aborted fetuses, or committed infanticide, rather allow their children to live within the bonds of slavery.as in its louisiana colony, the french colonial government allowed some rights to free people of color: the mixed-race descendants of white male colonists and black female slaves , these records are in the national archives of france. according to the 1788 census, haitis population consisted of nearly 40,000 whites, 30,000 free coloureds and 450,000 slaves.the haitian revolution of 1804, the only successful slave revolt in human history, precipitated the end of slavery in all french colonies.jamaica was colonized by the taino tribes prior to the arrival of columbus in 1494. the spanish enslaved many of the taino; some escaped, but most died from european diseases and overwork. the spaniards also introduced the first african slaves.the spanish colonists did not bring women in the first expeditions and took ta50 years.  they were sent to work in the gold mines, or in the islands ginger and sugar fields.  they were allowed to live with their families in a hut on the masters land, and given a patch of land where they could farm, but otherwise were subjected to harsh treatment; including sexual abuse as the majority of colonists had arrived without women; many of them intermarried with the africans or ta2, 1873, slavery was legally abolished in puerto rico. however, slaves were not emancipated but rather had to buy their own freedom, at whatever price was set by their last masters. they were also required to work for another three years for their former masters, for other colonists interested in their services, or for the state in order to pay some compensation. between 1527 and 1873, slaves in puerto rico had carried out more than twenty revolts.the planters of the dutch colony relied heavily on african slaves to cultivate, harvest and process the commodity crops of coffee, cocoa, sugar cane and cotton plantations along the rivers. planters treatment of the slaves was notoriously bad.  historian c. r. boxer wrote that ""mans inhumanity to man just about reached its limits in surinam.""many slaves escaped the plantations.  with the help of the native south americans living in the adjoining rain forests, these runaway slaves established a new and unique culture in the interior that was highly successful in its own right. they were known collectively in english as maroons, in french as n018, the orlando sentinel reported some private christian schools in florida as teaching students a creationist curriculum which includes assertions such as, 6 and 1662, the dutch exported on an average 1504, 1587, to demand the portuguese, siamese  hideyoshi blamed the portuguese and jesuits for this slave trade and banned christian proselytizing as a result. in 1595, a law was passed by portugal banning the selling and buying of chinese and japanese slaves.during the joseon period, the nobi population could fluctuate up to about one-third of the population, but on average the nobi made up about 10% of the total population. the nobi system declined beginning in the 18th century. since the outset of the joseon dynasty and especially beginning in the 17th century, there was harsh criticism among prominent thinkers in korea about the nobi system. even within the joseon government, there were indications of a shift in attitude toward the nobi. king yeongjo implemented a policy of gradual emancipation in 1775, and he and his successor king jeongjo made many proposals and developments that lessened the burden on nobi, which led to the emancipation of the vast majority of government nobi in 1801. in addition, population growth, numerous escaped slaves, growing commercialization of agriculture, and the rise of the independent small farmer class contributed to the decline in the number of nobi to about 1.5% of the total population by 1858. the hereditary nobi system was officially abolished around 188600,000 slaves  million people, both those considered undesirable and citizens of conquered countries, with the avowed intention of treating these untermenschen even though slavery is now outlawed in every country, the number of slaves today is estimated as between 129.87005, the international labour organization provided an estimate of 12.38.4006 divided into three categories: bonded labour/debt bondage  kara provides a dynamic model to calculate the number of slaves in the world each year, with an estimated 29.2009.according to a 2003 report by human rights watch, an estimated 15013, found india had the highest number of slaves, nearly 14013, u.s. state department released a report on slavery.  it placed russia, china, and uzbekistan in the worst offenders category.  cuba, iran, north korea, sudan, syria, and zimbabwe were at the lowest level. the list also included algeria, libya, saudi arabia and kuwait among a total of 21 countries.the walk free foundation reported in 2018 that slavery in wealthy western societies is much more prevalent than previously known, in particular the united states and great britain, which have 403,000  an estimated 40.3.6007. however, although slavery, as a practice, was legally banned in 1981, it was not a crime to own a slave until 2007. although many slaves have escaped or have been freed since 2007, as of 2012, only one slave owner had been sentenced to serve time in prison.while american slaves in 1809 were sold for around $40,000  slavery is a multibillion-dollar industry with estimates of up to $35006, approximately 800,000 people are trafficked across national borders, which does not include millions trafficked within their own countries. approximately 80% of transnational victims are women and girls, and up to 50% are minors, reports the u.s. state department in a 2008 study.while the majority of trafficking victims are women who are forced into prostitution  because of the illegal nature of human trafficking, its extent is unknown. a u.s. government report, published in 2005, estimates that about 700,000 people worldwide are trafficked across borders each year. this figure does not include those who are trafficked internally. another research effort revealed that roughly 1.56932 bce, abolished the slave trade but not slavery. the qin dynasty, which ruled china from 221 to 206 bc, abolished slavery and discouraged serfdom. however, many of its laws were overturned when the dynasty was overthrown. slavery was again abolished by wang mang in china in 17 ce but was reinstituted after his assassination.the spanish colonization of the americas sparked a discussion about the right to enslave native americans. a prominent critic of slavery in the spanish new world colonies was bartolom, with british judge lord mansfield, whose opinion in somersetts case was widely taken to have held that slavery was illegal in england. this judgement also laid down the principle that slavery contracted in other jurisdictions could not be enforced in england.sons of africa was a late 18th-century british group that campaigned to end slavery. its members were africans in london, freed slaves who included ottobah cugoano, olaudah equiano and other leading members of londons black community. it was closely connected to the society for the abolition of the slave trade, a non-denominational group founded in 1787, whose members included thomas clarkson. british member of parliament william wilberforce led the anti-slavery movement in the united kingdom, although the groundwork was an anti-slavery essay by clarkson. wilberforce was urged by his close friend, prime minister william pitt the younger, to make the issue his own and was also given support by reformed evangelical john newton. the slave trade act was passed by the british parliament on march 25, 1807, making the slave trade illegal throughout the british empire, wilberforce also campaigned for abolition of slavery in the british empire, which he lived to see in the slavery abolition act 1833.after the 1807 act abolishing the slave trade was passed, these campaigners switched to encouraging other countries to follow suit, notably france and the british colonies. between 1808 and 1860, the british west africa squadron seized approximately 1,600 slave ships and freed 150,000 africans who were aboard. action was also taken against african leaders who refused to agree to british treaties to outlaw the trade, for example against ""the usurping king of lagos"", deposed in 1851. anti-slavery treaties were signed with over 50 african rulers.in 1839, the worlds oldest international human rights organization, anti-slavery international, was formed in britain by joseph sturge, which campaigned to outlaw slavery in other countries. there were celebrations in 2007 to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the abolition of the slave trade in the united kingdom through the work of the british anti-slavery society.in the 1860s, david livingstones reports of atrocities within the arab slave trade in africa stirred up the interest of the british public, reviving the flagging abolitionist movement. the royal navy throughout the 1870s attempted to suppress ""this abominable eastern trade"", at zanzibar in particular. in 1905, the french abolished indigenous slavery in most of french west africa.on december 10, 1948, the united nations general assembly adopted the universal declaration of human rights, which declared freedom from slavery is an internationally recognized human right. article 4 of the universal declaration of human rights states:no one shall be held in slavery or servitude; slavery and the slave trade shall be prohibited in all their forms.in 2014, for the first time in history, major leaders of many religions, buddhist, anglican, catholic, orthodox christian, hindu, jewish, and muslim met to sign a shared commitment against modern-day slavery; the declaration they signed calls for the elimination of slavery and human trafficking by 2020. the signatories were: pope francis, mn kh1, 2001, the national assembly of france passed the taubira law, recognizing slavery as a crime against humanity. apologies on behalf of african nations, for their role in trading their countrymen into slavery, remain an open issue since slavery was practiced in africa even before the first europeans arrived and the atlantic slave trade was performed with a high degree of involvement of several african societies. the black slave market was supplied by well-established slave trade networks controlled by local african societies and individuals.there is adequate evidence citing case after case of african control of segments of the trade. several african nations such as the calabar and other southern parts of nigeria had economies depended solely on the trade. african peoples such as the imbangala of angola and the nyamwezi of tanzania would serve as middlemen or roving bands warring with other african nations to capture africans for europeans.several historians have made important contributions to the global understanding of the african side of the atlantic slave trade. by arguing that african merchants determined the assemblage of trade goods accepted in exchange for slaves, many historians argue for african agency and ultimately a shared responsibility for the slave trade.in 1999, president mathieu kerekou of benin issued a national apology for the central role africans played in the atlantic slave trade. luc gnacadja, minister of environment and housing for benin, later said: ""the slave trade is a shame, and we do repent for it."" researchers estimate that 3007, british prime minister tony blair made a formal apology for great britains involvement in slavery.on february 25, 2007, the commonwealth of virginia resolved to profoundly regret and apologize for its role in the institution of slavery. unique and the first of its kind in the u.s., the apology was unanimously passed in both houses as virginia approached the 400th anniversary of the founding of jamestown.on august 24, 2007, mayor ken livingstone of london apologized publicly for britains role in colonial slave trade. ""you can look across there to see the institutions that still have the benefit of the wealth they created from slavery,"" he said, pointing towards the financial district. he claimed that london was still tainted by the horrors of slavery. specifically, london outfitted, financed, and insured many of the ships, which helped fund the building of londons docks. officials in liverpool, which was a large slave trading port, apologized in 1999.on july 30, 2008, the united states house of representatives passed a resolution apologizing for american slavery and subsequent discriminatory laws. in june 2009, the u.s. senate passed a resolution apologizing to african-americans for the ""fundamental injustice, cruelty, brutality, and inhumanity of slavery"". the news was welcomed by president barack obama, the nations first president of african descent. some of president obamas ancestors may have been slave owners.in 2010, libyan leader muammar gaddafi apologized for arab involvement in the slave trade, saying: ""i regret the behavior of the arabs\x80\xa6 they brought african children to north africa, they made them slaves, they sold them like animals, and they took them as slaves and traded them in a shameful way.""there have been movements to achieve reparations for those formerly held as slaves or for their descendants. claims for reparations for being held in slavery are handled as a civil law matter in almost every country. this is often decried as a serious problem, since former slaves relatives lack of money means they often have limited access to a potentially expensive and futile legal process. mandatory systems of fines and reparations paid to an as yet undetermined group of claimants from fines, paid by unspecified parties, and collected by authorities have been proposed by advocates to alleviate this ""civil court problem."" since in almost all cases there are no living ex-slaves or living ex-slave owners these movements have gained little traction. in nearly all cases the judicial system has ruled that the statute of limitations on these possible claims has long since expired.the word slavery is often used as a pejorative to describe any activity in which one is coerced into performing. some argue that military drafts and other forms of coerced government labour constitute ""state-operated slavery."" some libertarians and anarcho-capitalists view government taxation as a form of slavery.""slavery"" has been used by some anti-psychiatry proponents to define involuntary psychiatric patients, claiming there are no unbiased physical tests for mental illness and yet the psychiatric patient must follow the orders of the psychiatrist. they assert that instead of chains to control the slave, the psychiatrist uses drugs to control the mind. drapetomania was a psychiatric diagnosis for a slave who did not want to be a slave.some proponents of animal rights have applied the term slavery to the condition of some or all human-owned animals, arguing that their status is comparable to that of human slaves.the labor market, as institutionalized under todays market economic systems, has been criticized by mainstream socialists and by anarcho-syndicalists, who utilise the term wage slavery as a pejorative or dysphemism for wage labour. socialists draw parallels between the trade of labour as a commodity and slavery. cicero is also known to have suggested such parallels.film has been the most influential medium in the presentation of the history of slavery to the general public around the world. the american film industry has had a complex relationship with slavery and until recent decades often avoided the topic. films such as birth of a nation  and gone with the wind  song of the south gave a favorable outlook on slavery in the united states in 1946.the civil rights movement in the 1950s made defiant slaves into heroes. the question of slavery in american memory necessarily involves its depictions in feature films. most hollywood films used american settings, although spartacus  spartacus stays surprisingly close to the historical record.the last supper  berlin argues that critics complain if the treatment emphasizes historical brutality, or if it glosses over the harshness to highlight the emotional impact of slavery.",1,0
"in ordinary language, a crime is an unlawful act punishable by a state or other authority. the term crime does not, in modern criminal law, have any simple and universally accepted definition, though statutory definitions have been provided for certain purposes. the most popular view is that crime is a category created by law; in other words, something is a crime if declared as such by the relevant and applicable law. one proposed definition is that a crime or offence the notion that acts such as murder, rape, and theft are to be prohibited exists worldwide. what precisely is a criminal offence is defined by criminal law of each country. while many have a catalogue of crimes called the criminal code, in some common law countries no such comprehensive statute exists.the state while every crime violates the law, not every violation of the law counts as a crime. breaches of private law when informal relationships prove insufficient to establish and maintain a desired social order, a government or a state may impose more formalized or stricter systems of social control. with institutional and legal machinery at their disposal, agents of the state can compel populations to conform to codes and can opt to punish or attempt to reform those who do not conform.authorities employ various mechanisms to regulate the sociologist richard quinney has written about the relationship between society and crime. when quinney states ""crime is a social phenomenon"" he envisages both how individuals conceive crime and how populations perceive it, based on societal norms.the word crime is derived from the latin root cern43 of the trade union and labour relations a normative definition views crime as deviant behavior that violates prevailing norms0th century, michel foucault in discipline and punish made a study of criminalization as a coercive method of state control.the following classes of offences are used, or have been used, as legal terms:researchers and commentators have classified crimes into the following categories, in addition to those above:one can categorise crimes depending on the related punishment, with sentencing tariffs prescribed in line with the perceived seriousness of the offence. thus fines and noncustodial sentences may address the crimes seen as least serious, with lengthy imprisonment or officials compile this data at the city, county, and state levels into the ucr. they classify violations of laws based on common law as part i  they are further split into:many different causes and correlates of crime have been proposed with varying degree of empirical support. they include socioeconomic, psychological, biological, and behavioral factors. controversial topics include media violence research and effects of gun politics.emotional state  in positive emotional states an individual is able to consider more possible solutions to problems, but in lower emotional states fewer solutions can be ascertained. the narrowed thought-action repertoires can result in the only paths perceptible to an individual being ones they would never use if they saw an alternative, but if they cant conceive of the alternatives that carry less risk they will choose one that they can see. criminals who commit even the most horrendous of crimes, such as mass murders, did not see another solution.crimes defined by treaty as crimes against international law include:from the point of view of state-centric law, extraordinary procedures different religious traditions may promote distinct norms of behaviour, and these in turn may clash or harmonise with the perceived interests of a state. socially accepted or imposed religious morality has influenced secular jurisdictions on issues that may otherwise concern only an individuals conscience. activities sometimes criminalized on religious grounds include in the united states, it is estimated that workers are not paid at least $19 billion every year in overtime and that in total $40 billion to $60 billion are lost annually due to all forms of wage theft. this compares to national annual losses of $340 million due to robbery, $4.1 billion due to burglary, $5.3 billion due to larceny, and $3.8 billion due to auto theft in 2012. in singapore, as in the united states, wage theft was found to be widespread and severe. in a 2014 survey it was found that as many as one-third of low wage male foreign workers in singapore, or about 130,000, were affected by wage theft from partial to full denial of pay.",1,0
"a typewriter is a mechanical or electromechanical machine for typing characters similar to those produced by a printers movable type. typically, a typewriter has an array of keys, and each one causes a different single character to be produced on the paper, by means of a ribbon with dried ink struck against the paper by a type element similar to the sorts used in movable type letterpress printing. on some typewriters, a separate type element the first commercial typewriters were introduced in 1874, but did not become common in offices until after the mid-1880s. the typewriter quickly became an indispensable tool for practically all writing other than personal handwritten correspondence. it was widely used by professional writers, in offices, business correspondence in private homes, and by students preparing term papers.typewriters were a standard fixture in most offices up to the 1980s. thereafter, they began to be largely supplanted by computers. nevertheless, typewriters remain common in some parts of the world, are required for a few specific applications, and are popular in certain subcultures. in many indian cities and towns, typewriters are still used, especially in roadside and legal offices due to a lack of continuous, reliable electricity. the qwerty keyboard layout, developed for typewriters, remains the standard for computer keyboards.notable typewriter manufacturers included e. remington and sons, ibm, godrej, imperial typewriter company, oliver typewriter company, olivetti, royal typewriter company, smith corona, underwood typewriter company, adler typewriter company and olympia werke times as thinkers tried to come up with a workable design.some early typing instruments include:by the mid-19th century, the increasing pace of business communication had created a need for mechanization of the writing process. stenographers and telegraphers could take down information at rates up to 130 words per minute, whereas a writer with a pen was limited to a maximum of 30 words per minute from 1829 to 1870, many printing or typing machines were patented by inventors in europe and america, but none went into commercial production.in 1865, rev. rasmus malling-hansen of denmark invented the hansen writing ball, which went into commercial production in 1870 and was the first commercially sold typewriter. it was a success in europe and was reported as being used in offices in london as late as 1909.  malling-hansen used a solenoid escapement to return the carriage on some of his models which makes him a candidate for the title of inventor of the first ""electric"" typewriter.according to the book hvem er skrivekuglens opfinder? malling-hansen developed his typewriter further through the 1870s and 1880s and made many improvements, but the writing head remained the same. on the first model of the writing ball from 1870, the paper was attached to a cylinder inside a wooden box. in 1874, the cylinder was replaced by a carriage, moving beneath the writing head. then, in 1875, the well-known ""tall model"" was patented, which was the first of the writing balls that worked without electricity. malling-hansen attended the world exhibitions in vienna in 1873 and paris in 1878 and he received the first-prize for his invention at both exhibitions.the first typewriter to be commercially successful was patented in 1868 by americans christopher latham sholes, frank haven hall, carlos glidden and samuel w. soule in milwaukee, wisconsin, although sholes soon disowned the machine and refused to use or even recommend it. it looked ""like something like a cross between a piano and a kitchen table"". the working prototype was made by the machinist matthias schwalbach. the patent  the index typewriter uses a pointer or stylus to choose a letter from an index. the pointer is mechanically linked so that the letter chosen could then be printed, most often by the activation of a lever.the index typewriter was briefly popular in niche markets. although they were slower than keyboard type machines they were mechanically simpler and lighter, they were therefore marketed as being suitable for travellers, and because they could be produced more cheaply than keyboard machines, as budget machines for users who needed to produce small quantities of typed correspondence. the index typewriters niche appeal however soon disappeared, as on the one hand new keyboard typewriters became lighter and more portable and on the other refurbished second hand machines began to become available. the last widely available western index machine was the mignon typewriter produced by aeg which was produced until 1934. considered one of the very best of the index typewriters, part of the mignons popularity was that it featured both interchangeable indexes and type, allowing the use of different fonts and character sets, something very few keyboard machines allowed and only at considerable added cost.although pushed out of the market in most of the world by keyboard machines, successful japanese and chinese typewriters are of the index type albeit with a very much larger index and number of type elements.by about 1910, the ""manual"" or ""mechanical"" typewriter had reached a somewhat standardized design. there were minor variations from one manufacturer to another, but most typewriters followed the concept that each key was attached to a typebar that had the corresponding letter molded, in reverse, into its striking head.  when a key was struck briskly and firmly, the typebar hit a ribbon  typewriters for languages written right-to-left operate in the opposite direction.in most of the early typewriters, the typebars struck upward against the paper, pressed against the bottom of the platen, so the typist could not see the text as it was typed.  what was typed was not visible until a carriage return caused it to scroll into view. the difficulty with any other arrangement was ensuring the typebars fell back into place reliably when the key was released. this was eventually achieved with various ingenious mechanical designs and so-called ""visible typewriters"" which used frontstriking, in which the typebars struck forward against the front side of the platen, became standard.one of the first was the daugherty visible, introduced in 1893, which also introduced the four-bank keyboard that became standard, although the underwood which came out two years later was the first major typewriter with these features.  however, older ""nonvisible"" models continued in production to as late as 1915.a significant innovation was the shift key, introduced with the remington no. 2 in 1878. this key physically ""shifted"" either the basket of typebars, in which case the typewriter is described as ""basket shift"", or the paper-holding carriage, in which case the typewriter is described as ""carriage shift"".  either mechanism caused a different portion of the typebar to come in contact with the ribbon/platen.  the result is that each typebar could type two different characters, cutting the number of keys and typebars in half in the early part of the 20th century, a typewriter was marketed under the name noiseless and advertised as ""silent"". it was developed by wellington parker kidder and the first model was marketed by the noiseless typewriter company in 1917. an agreement with remington in 1924 saw production transferred to remington, and a further agreement in 1929 allowed underwood to produce it as well. noiseless portables sold well in the 1930s and 1940s, and noiseless standards continued to be manufactured until the 1960s.in a conventional typewriter the typebar reaches the end of its travel simply by striking the ribbon and paper. a ""noiseless"" typewriter has a complex lever mechanism that decelerates the typebar mechanically before pressing it against the ribbon and paper in an attempt to dampen the noise. it certainly reduced the high-frequency content of the sound, rendering it more of a ""clunk"" than a ""clack"" and arguably less intrusive, but such advertising claims as ""a machine that can be operated a few feet away from your desk . like the manual blickensderfer typewriters, it used a cylindrical typewheel rather than individual typebars. the machine was produced in several variants but apparently it was not a commercial success, for reasons that are unclear.the next step in the development of the electric typewriter came in 1910, when charles and howard krum filed a patent for the first practical teletypewriter. the krums machine, named the morkrum printing telegraph, used a typewheel rather than individual typebars.  this machine was used for the first commercial teletypewriter system on postal telegraph company lines between boston and new york city in 1910.james fields smathers of kansas city invented what is considered the first practical power-operated typewriter in 1914. in 1920, after returning from army service, he produced a successful model and in 1923 turned it over to the northeast electric company of rochester for development. northeast was interested in finding new markets for their electric motors and developed smatherss design so that it could be marketed to typewriter manufacturers, and from 1925 remington electric typewriters were produced powered by northeasts motors.after some 2,500 electric typewriters had been produced, northeast asked remington for a firm contract for the next batch. however, remington was engaged in merger talks, which would eventually result in the creation of remington rand and no executives were willing to commit to a firm order. northeast instead decided to enter the typewriter business for itself, and in 1929 produced the first electromatic typewriter.in 1928, delco, a division of general motors, purchased northeast electric, and the typewriter business was spun off as electromatic typewriters, inc. in 1933, electromatic was acquired by ibm, which then spent $1009, typewriters continued to be used by a number of government agencies and other institutions in the us, where they are primarily used to fill preprinted forms. according to a boston typewriter repairman quoted by the boston globe, ""every maternity ward has a typewriter, as well as funeral homes"".a fairly major typewriter user is the city of new york, which in 2008 purchased several thousand typewriters, mostly for use by the new york police department, at the total cost of $982,269. another $99,570 was spent in 2009 for the maintenance of the existing typewriters. new york police officers would use the machines to type property and evidence vouchers on carbon paper forms.a rather specialized market for typewriters exists due to the regulations of many correctional systems in the us, where prisoners are prohibited from having computers or telecommunication equipment, but are allowed to own typewriters. the swintec corporation in april 2011, godrej and boyce, a mumbai-based manufacturer of mechanical typewriters, closed its doors, leading to a flurry of  news reports that the ""worlds last typewriter factory"" had shut down. the reports were quickly contested, with opinions settling to agree that it was indeed the worlds last producer of manual typewriters.in november 2012, brothers uk factory manufactured what it claimed to be the last typewriter ever made in the uk; the typewriter was donated to the london science museum.russian typewriters use cyrillic, which has made the ongoing azerbaijani reconversion from cyrillic to latin alphabet more difficult. in 1997, the government of turkey offered to donate western typewriters to the republic of azerbaijan in exchange for more zealous and exclusive promotion of the latin alphabet for the azerbaijani language; this offer, however, was declined.in latin america and africa, mechanical typewriters are still common because they can be used without electrical power. in latin america, the typewriters used are most often brazilian models; brazil continues to produce mechanical the 21st century has seen a revival of interest in typewriters among certain subcultures, including makers, steampunks, hipsters, and street poets.according to the standards taught in secretarial schools in the mid-20th century, a business letter was supposed to have no mistakes and no visible corrections. accuracy was prized as much as speed. indeed, typing speeds, as scored in proficiency tests and typewriting speed competitions, included a deduction of ten words for every mistake. corrections were, of course, necessary, and many methods were developed.in practice, several methods would often be combined. for example, if six extra copies of a letter were needed, the fluid-corrected original would be photocopied, but only for the two recipients getting a c.c.; the other four copies, the less-important file copies that stayed in various departments at the office, would be cheaper, hand-erased, less-distinct bond paper copies or even ""flimsies"" of different colors dry correction products  the qwerty layout of keys has become the de facto standard for english-language typewriter and computer keyboards. other languages written in the latin alphabet sometimes use variants of the qwerty layouts, such as the french azerty, the italian qzerty and the german qwertz layouts.the qwerty layout is not the most efficient layout possible for the english language, since it requires a touch-typist to move his or her fingers between rows to type the most common letters. although the qwerty keyboard was the most commonly used layout in typewriters, a better, less strenuous keyboard was being searched for throughout the late 1900s.one popular but unverified explanation for the qwerty arrangement is that it was designed to reduce the likelihood of internal clashing of typebars by placing commonly used combinations of letters farther from each other inside the machine.a number of radically different layouts such as dvorak have been proposed to reduce the perceived inefficiencies of qwerty, but none have been able to displace the qwerty layout; their proponents claim considerable advantages, but so far none has been widely used. the blickensderfer typewriter with its dhiatensor layout may have possibly been the first attempt at optimizing the keyboard layout for efficiency advantages.many non-latin alphabets have keyboard layouts that have nothing to do with qwerty. the russian layout, for instance, puts the common trigrams  whether or not a particular suspect typewriter might have been used to produce a document. in some situations, an ink or correction ribbon may also be examined.the determination of a make and/or model of typewriter is a classification problem and several systems have been developed for this purpose. these include the original haas typewriter atlases  and  and the type system developed by dr. philip bouffard, the royal canadian mounted polices termatrex typewriter classification system, and interpols typewriter classification system, among others.because of the tolerances of the mechanical parts, slight variation in the alignment of the letters and their uneven wear, each typewriter has an individual ""signature"" or ""fingerprint"", which may permit a typewritten document to be traced back to the typewriter on which it was produced. for devices utilizing replaceable components, such as a typeball element, any association may be restricted to a specific element, rather than to the typewriter as a whole.the earliest reference in fictional literature to the potential identification of a typewriter as having produced a document was by sir arthur conan doyle, who wrote the sherlock holmes short story ""a case of identity"" in 1891. in non-fiction, the first document examiner to describe how a typewriter might be identified was william e. hagan who wrote, in 1894, ""all typewriter machines, even when using the same kind of type, become more or less peculiar by use as to the work done by them"". other early discussions of the topic were provided by a. s. osborn in his 1908 treatise, typewriting as evidence, and again in his 1929 textbook, questioned documents.  a modern description of the examination procedure is laid out in astm standard e2494-08 typewriter examination was used in the leopold and loeb and alger hiss cases. in the eastern bloc, typewriters   people previously convicted of any crime or those who because of their behaviour were considered to be ""a danger to public order or to the security of the state"" were refused approval. in addition, once a year, typewriter owners had to take the typewriter to the local police station, where they would be asked to type a sample of all the typewriters characters. it was also forbidden to borrow, lend, or repair typewriters other than at the places that had been authorized by the police.the ribbon can be read, although only if it has not been typed over more than once. this is not as easy as reading text from a page as the ribbon does not include spaces, but can be done, giving every typewriter a ""memory"".peter mitterhofer 1864 typewriterhansen writing ball, invented in 1865 (1870 model1868 patent drawing for the sholes, glidden, and soule typewriterhammond 1b typewriter,

"at least 48 publishedthe horse  is one of two extant subspecies of equus ferus. it is an odd-toed ungulate mammal belonging to the taxonomic family equidae. the horse has evolved over the past 45 to 555 and 305 to 30. in modern times, sugar puff, who had been listed in guinness world records as the worlds oldest living pony, died in 2007 at age 56.regardless of a horse or ponys actual birth date, for most competition purposes a year is added to its age each january1.2007. it contains 2.7 billion dna base pairs, which is larger than the dog genome, but smaller than the human genome or the bovine genome. the map is available to researchers.horses exhibit a diverse array of coat colors and distinctive markings, described by a specialized vocabulary. often, a horse is classified first by its coat color, before breed or sex. horses of the same color may be distinguished from one another by white markings, which, along with various spotting patterns, are inherited separately from coat color.many genes that create horse coat colors and patterns have been identified. current genetic tests can identify at least 13 different alleles influencing coat color, and research continues to discover new genes linked to specific traits. the basic coat colors of chestnut and black are determined by the gene controlled by the melanocortin 1 receptor, also known as the ""extension gene"" or ""red factor,"" as its recessive form is ""red""  additional genes control suppression of black color to point coloration that results in a bay, spotting patterns such as pinto or leopard, dilution genes such as palomino or dun, as well as graying, and all the other factors that create the many possible coat colors found in horses.horses that have a white coat color are often mislabeled; a horse that looks ""white"" is usually a middle-aged or older gray. grays are born a darker shade, get lighter as they age, but usually keep black skin underneath their white hair coat  different and unrelated genetic factors can produce white coat colors in horses, including several different alleles of dominant white and the sabino-1 gene. however, there are no ""albino"" horses, defined as having both pink skin and red eyes.gestation lasts approximately 34002 days and occurs from early spring into autumn. most mares enter an anestrus period during the winter and thus do not cycle in this period. foals are generally weaned from their mothers between four and six months of age.horses, particularly colts, sometimes are physically capable of reproduction at about 1805 bones. a significant difference between the horse skeleton and that of a human is the lack of a collarbone485013 study in the uk indicated that stabled horses were calmest in a quiet setting, or if listening to country or classical music, but displayed signs of nervousness when listening to jazz or rock music. this study also recommended keeping music under a volume of 21 decibels. an australian study found that stabled racehorses listening to talk radio had a higher rate of gastric ulcers than horses listening to music, and racehorses stabled where a radio was played had a higher overall rate of ulceration than horses stabled where there was no radio playing.horses have a great sense of balance, due partly to their ability to feel their footing and partly to highly developed proprioception4-hour period may range from several minutes to a couple of hours, mostly in short intervals of about 15.9 hours per day.horses must lie down to reach rem sleep. they only have to lie down for an hour or two every few days to meet their minimum rem sleep requirements. however, if a horse is never allowed to lie down, after several days it will become sleep-deprived, and in rare cases may suddenly collapse as it involuntarily slips into rem sleep while still standing. this condition differs from narcolepsy, although horses may also suffer from that disorder.the horse adapted to survive in areas of wide-open terrain with sparse vegetation, surviving in an ecosystem where other large grazing animals, especially ruminants, could not. horses and other equids are odd-toed ungulates of the order perissodactyla, a group of mammals that was dominant during the tertiary period. in the past, this order contained 14 to 37,500 years ago, the grasses characteristic of a steppe ecosystem gave way to shrub tundra, which was covered with unpalatable plants.a truly wild horse is a species or subspecies with no ancestors that were ever domesticated. therefore, most ""wild"" horses today are actually feral horses, animals that escaped or were turned loose from domestic herds and the descendants of those animals. only two never-domesticated subspecies, the tarpan and the przewalskis horse, survived into recorded history and only the latter survives today.the przewalskis horse  today, a small wild breeding population exists in mongolia. there are additional animals still maintained at zoos throughout the world.the tarpan or european wild horse  thus, the genetic line was lost. attempts have been made to recreate the tarpan, which resulted in horses with outward physical similarities, but nonetheless descended from domesticated ancestors and not true wild horses.periodically, populations of horses in isolated areas are speculated to be relict populations of wild horses, but generally have been proven to be feral or domestic. for example, the riwoche horse of tibet was proposed as such, but testing did not reveal genetic differences from domesticated horses. similarly, the sorraia of portugal was proposed as a direct descendant of the tarpan based on shared characteristics, but genetic studies have shown that the sorraia is more closely related to other horse breeds and that the outward similarity is an unreliable measure of relatedness.besides the horse, there are six other species of genus equus in the equidae family. these are the ass or donkey, equus asinus; the mountain zebra, equus zebra; plains zebra, equus quagga; gr000 bc there was a sharp increase in the number of horse bones found in human settlements in northwestern europe, indicating the spread of domesticated horses throughout the continent. the most recent, but most irrefutable evidence of domestication comes from sites where horse remains were interred with chariots in graves of the sintashta and petrovka cultures c. 2100 bc.domestication is also studied by using the genetic material of present-day horses and comparing it with the genetic material present in the bones and teeth of horse remains found in archaeological and palaeological excavations. the variation in the genetic material shows that very few wild stallions contributed to the domestic horse, while many mares were part of early domesticated herds. this is reflected in the difference in genetic variation between the dna that is passed on along the paternal, or sire line  but a great deal of genetic variation in mitochondrial dna. there is also regional variation in mitochondrial dna due to the inclusion of wild mares in domestic herds. another characteristic of domestication is an increase in coat color variation. in horses, this increased dramatically between 5000 and 3000 bc.before the availability of dna techniques to resolve the questions related to the domestication of the horse, various hypotheses were proposed. one classification was based on body types and conformation, suggesting the presence of four basic prototypes that had adapted to their environment prior to domestication. another hypothesis held that the four prototypes originated from a single wild species and that all different body types were entirely a result of selective breeding after domestication. however, the lack of a detectable substructure  in the horse has resulted in a rejection of both hypotheses.feral horses are born and live in the wild, but are descended from domesticated animals. many populations of feral horses exist throughout the world. studies of feral herds have provided useful insights into the behavior of prehistoric horses, as well as greater understanding of the instincts and behaviors that drive horses that live in domesticated conditions.there are also semi-feral horses in many parts of the world, such as dartmoor and the new forest in the uk, where the animals are all privately owned but live for significant amounts of time in ""wild"" conditions on undeveloped, often public, lands. owners of such animals often pay a fee for grazing rights.the concept of purebred bloodstock and a controlled, written breed registry has come to be particularly significant and important in modern times. sometimes purebred horses are incorrectly or inaccurately called ""thoroughbreds"". thoroughbred is a specific breed of horse, while a ""purebred"" is a horse  horse breeds are groups of horses with distinctive characteristics that are transmitted consistently to their offspring, such as conformation, color, performance ability, or disposition. these inherited traits result from a combination of natural crosses and artificial selection methods. horses have been selectively bred since their domestication. an early example of people who practiced selective horse breeding were the bedouin, who had a reputation for careful practices, keeping extensive pedigrees of their arabian horses and placing great value upon pure bloodlines. these pedigrees were originally transmitted via an oral tradition. in the 14th century, carthusian monks of southern spain kept meticulous pedigrees of bloodstock lineages still found today in the andalusian horse.breeds developed due to a need for ""form to function"", the necessity to develop certain characteristics in order to perform a particular type of work. thus, a powerful but refined breed such as the andalusian developed as riding horses with an aptitude for dressage. heavy draft horses were developed out of a need to perform demanding farm work and pull heavy wagons. other horse breeds had been developed specifically for light agricultural work, carriage and road work, various sport disciplines, or simply as pets. some breeds developed through centuries of crossing other breeds, while others descended from a single foundation sire, or other limited or restricted foundation bloodstock. one of the earliest formal registries was general stud book for thoroughbreds, which began in 1791 and traced back to the foundation bloodstock for the breed. there are more than 300 billion. in a 2004 ""poll"" conducted by animal planet, more than 50,000 viewers from 73 countries voted for the horse as the worlds 4th favorite animal.communication between human and horse is paramount in any equestrian activity; to aid this process horses are usually ridden with a saddle on their backs to assist the rider with balance and positioning, and a bridle or related headgear to assist the rider in maintaining control. sometimes horses are ridden without a saddle, and occasionally, horses are trained to perform without a bridle or other headgear. many horses are also driven, which requires a harness, bridle, and some type of vehicle.historically, equestrians honed their skills through games and races. equestrian sports provided entertainment for crowds and honed the excellent horsemanship that was needed in battle. many sports, such as dressage, eventing and show jumping, have origins in military training, which were focused on control and balance of both horse and rider. other sports, such as rodeo, developed from practical skills such as those needed on working ranches and stations. sport hunting from horseback evolved from earlier practical hunting techniques. horse racing of all types evolved from impromptu competitions between riders or drivers. all forms of competition, requiring demanding and specialized skills from both horse and rider, resulted in the systematic development of specialized breeds and equipment for each sport. the popularity of equestrian sports through the centuries has resulted in the preservation of skills that would otherwise have disappeared after horses stopped being used in combat.horses are trained to be ridden or driven in a variety of sporting competitions. examples include show jumping, dressage, three-day eventing, competitive driving, endurance riding, gymkhana, rodeos, and fox hunting. horse shows, which have their origins in medieval european fairs, are held around the world. they host a huge range of classes, covering all of the mounted and harness disciplines, as well as ""in-hand"" classes where the horses are led, rather than ridden, to be evaluated on their conformation. the method of judging varies with the discipline, but winning usually depends on style and ability of both horse and rider.sports such as polo do not judge the horse itself, but rather use the horse as a partner for human competitors as a necessary part of the game. although the horse requires specialized training to participate, the details of its performance are not judged, only the result of the riders actions71st century by the janjaweed militias in the war in darfur.modern horses are often used to reenact many of their historical work purposes. horses are used, complete with equipment that is authentic or a meticulously recreated replica, in various live action historical reenactments of specific periods of history, especially recreations of famous battles. horses are also used to preserve cultural traditions and for ceremonial purposes. countries such as the united kingdom still use horse-drawn carriages to convey royalty and other vips to and from certain culturally significant events. public exhibitions are another example, such as the budweiser clydesdales, seen in parades and other public settings, a team of draft horses that pull a beer wagon similar to that used before the invention of the modern motorized truck.horses are frequently used in television, films and literature. they are sometimes featured as a major character in films about particular animals, but also used as visual elements that assure the accuracy of historical stories. both live horses and iconic images of horses are used in advertising to promote a variety of products. the horse frequently appears in coats of arms in heraldry, in a variety of poses and equipment. the mythologies of many cultures, including greco-roman, hindu, islamic, and norse, include references to both normal horses and those with wings or additional limbs, and multiple myths also call upon the horse to draw the chariots of the moon and sun. the horse also appears in the 12-year cycle of animals in the chinese zodiac related to the chinese calendar.people of all ages with physical and mental disabilities obtain beneficial results from an association with horses. therapeutic riding is used to mentally and physically stimulate disabled persons and help them improve their lives through improved balance and coordination, increased self-confidence, and a greater feeling of freedom and independence. the benefits of equestrian activity for people with disabilities has also been recognized with the addition of equestrian events to the paralympic games and recognition of para-equestrian events by the international federation for equestrian sports  hippotherapy and therapeutic horseback riding are names for different physical, occupational, and speech therapy treatment strategies that utilize equine movement. in hippotherapy, a therapist uses the horses movement to improve their patients cognitive, coordination, balance, and fine motor skills, whereas therapeutic horseback riding uses specific riding skills.horses also provide psychological benefits to people whether they actually ride or not. ""equine-assisted"" or ""equine-facilitated"" therapy is a form of experiential psychotherapy that uses horses as companion animals to assist people with mental illness, including anxiety disorders, psychotic disorders, mood disorders, behavioral difficulties, and those who are going through major life changes. there are also experimental programs using horses in prison settings. exposure to horses appears to improve the behavior of inmates and help reduce recidivism when they leave.horses are raw material for many products made by humans throughout history, including byproducts from the slaughter of horses as well as materials collected from living horses.products collected from living horses include mares milk, used by people with large horse herds, such as the mongols, who let it ferment to produce kumis. horse blood was once used as food by the mongols and other nomadic tribes, who found it a convenient source of nutrition when traveling. drinking their own horses blood allowed the mongols to ride for extended periods of time without stopping to eat. the drug premarin is a mixture of estrogens extracted from the urine of pregnant mares  the tail hair of horses can be used for making bows for string instruments such as the violin, viola, cello, and double bass.horse meat has been used as food for humans and carnivorous animals throughout the ages. approximately 5 million horses are slaughtered each year for meat worldwide. it is eaten in many parts of the world, though consumption is taboo in some cultures, and a subject of political controversy in others. horsehide leather has been used for boots, gloves, jackets, baseballs, and baseball gloves. horse hooves can also be used to produce animal glue. horse bones can be used to make implements. specifically, in italian cuisine, the horse tibia is sharpened into a probe called a spinto, which is used to test the readiness of a  in asia, the saba is a horsehide vessel used in the production of kumis.horses are grazing animals, and their major source of nutrients is good-quality forage from hay or pasture. they can consume approximately 2% to 2.5% of their body weight in dry feed each day. therefore, a 450-kilogram  sometimes, concentrated feed such as grain is fed in addition to pasture or hay, especially when the animal is very active. when grain is fed, equine nutritionists recommend that 50% or more of the animals diet by weight should still be forage.horses require a plentiful supply of clean water, a minimum of 10 us gallons  although horses are adapted to live outside, they require shelter from the wind and precipitation, which can range from a simple shed or shelter to an elaborate stable.horses require routine hoof care from a farrier, as well as vaccinations to protect against various diseases, and dental examinations from a veterinarian or a specialized equine dentist. if horses are kept inside in a barn, they require regular daily exercise for their physical health and mental well-being. when turned outside, they require well-maintained, sturdy fences to be safely contained. regular grooming is also helpful to help the horse maintain good health of the hair coat and underlying skin.",1,0
"education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, however learners can also educate themselves. education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. the methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.formal education is commonly divided formally into such stages as preschool or kindergarten, primary school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship.a right to education has been recognized by some governments and the united nations. in most regions, education is compulsory up to a certain age. there is a movement for education reform, and in particular for evidence-based education with global initiatives aimed at achieving the sustainable development goal 4, which promotes quality education for all.etymologically, the word ""education"" is derived from the latin word 5 fields, though the fields were later separated out to form a different project. the current version isced 2011 has 9 rather than 7 levels, created by dividing the tertiary pre-doctorate level into three levels. it also extended the lowest level education designed to support early development in preparation for participation in school and society. the programmes are designed for children below the age of 3. this is isced level 01. preschools provide education from ages approximately three to seven, depending on the country when children enter primary education. the children now readily interact with their peers and the educator. these are also known as nursery schools and as kindergarten, except in the us, where the term kindergarten refers to the earliest levels of primary education. kindergarten ""provides a child-centred, preschool curriculum for three- to seven-year-old children that aim at unfolding the childs physical, intellectual, and moral nature with balanced emphasis on each of them."" this is isced level 02.this is isced level 1. primary  under the education for all programs driven by unesco, most countries have committed to achieving universal enrollment in primary education by 2015, and in many countries, it is compulsory. the division between primary and secondary education is somewhat arbitrary, but it generally occurs at about eleven or twelve years of age. some education systems have separate middle schools, with the transition to the final stage of secondary education taking place at around the age of fifteen. schools that provide primary education, are mostly referred to as primary schools or elementary schools. primary schools are often subdivided into infant schools and junior schools.in india, for example, compulsory education spans over twelve years, with eight years of elementary education, five years of primary schooling and three years of upper primary schooling. various states in the republic of india provide 12 years of compulsory school education based on a national curriculum framework designed by the national council of educational research and training.this covers the two isced levels, isced 2: lower secondary education and isced 3: upper secondary education.in most contemporary educational systems of the world, secondary education comprises the formal education that occurs during adolescence.  in the united states, canada, and australia, primary and secondary education together are sometimes referred to as k-12 education, and in new zealand year 1, lower secondary education are usually organized around a more subject-oriented curriculum; differing from primary education. teachers typically havepedagogical training in the specific subjects and, more often than at isced level 1, a class ofstudents will have several teachers, each with specialized knowledge of the subjects they teach. programmes at isced level 2, aim to lay the foundation for lifelong learning and human development upon introducing theoretical concepts across a broad range of subjects which can be developed in future stages. some education systems may offer vocational education programs during isced level 2 providing skills relevant to employment.programs at isced level 3, or upper secondary education, are typically designed to complete the secondary education process. they lead to skills relevant to employment and the skill necessary to engage in tertiary courses. they offer students more varied, specialized and in-depth instruction. they are more differentiated, with range of options and learning streams.community colleges offer another option at this transitional stage of education. they provide nonresidential junior college courses to people living in a particular area.higher education, also called tertiary, third stage, or postsecondary education, is the non-compulsory educational level that follows the completion of a school such as a high school or secondary school. tertiary education is normally taken to include undergraduate and postgraduate education, as well as vocational education and training. colleges and universities mainly provide tertiary education. collectively, these are sometimes known as tertiary institutions. individuals who complete tertiary education generally receive certificates, diplomas, or academic degrees.the isced distinguishes 4 levels of tertiary education. isced 6 is equivalent to a first degree, isced 7 is equivalent to a masters or an advanced professional qualification and isced 8 is an advanced research qualification, usually concluding with the submission and defence of a substantive dissertation of publishable quality based on original research. the category isced 5 is reserved for short-cycle courses of requiring degree level study.higher education typically involves work towards a degree-level or foundation degree qualification. in most developed countries, a high proportion of the population  although what is known today as liberal arts education began in europe, the term ""liberal arts college"" is more commonly associated with institutions in the united states such as williams college or barnard college.vocational education is a form of education focused on direct and practical training for a specific trade or craft. vocational education may come in the form of an apprenticeship or internship as well as institutions teaching courses such as carpentry, agriculture, engineering, medicine, architecture and the arts. post 16 education, adult education and further education involve continued study, but a level no different from that found at upper secondary, and are grouped together as isced 4, post-secondary non-tertiary education.in the past, those who were disabled were often not eligible for public education. children with disabilities were repeatedly denied an education by physicians or special tutors.  these early physicians while considered ""alternative"" today, most alternative systems have existed since ancient times.  after the public school system was widely developed beginning in the 19th century, some parents found reasons to be discontented with the new system. alternative education developed in part as a reaction to perceived limitations and failings of traditional education. a broad range of educational approaches emerged, including alternative schools, self learning, homeschooling, and unschooling. example alternative schools include montessori schools, waldorf schools in time, some ideas from these experiments and paradigm challenges may be adopted as the norm in education, just as friedrich fr0th century, the concept was broadened to include young adults but the emphasis was on physical activities. l.p. jacks, also an early proponent of lifelong learning, described education through recreation: ""a master in the art of living draws no sharp distinction between his work and his play, his labour and his leisure, his mind and his body, his education and his recreation. he hardly knows which is which. he simply pursues his vision of excellence through whatever he is doing and leaves others to determine whether he is working or playing. to himself, he always seems to be doing both. enough for him that he does it well."" education through recreation is the opportunity to learn in a seamless fashion through all of lifes activities. the concept has been revived by the university of western ontario to teach anatomy to medical students.autodidacticism evidence-based education is the use of well designed scientific studies to determine which education methods work best. it consists of evidence-based teaching and evidence-based learning. evidence-based learning methods such as spaced repetition can increase rate of learning. the evidence-based education movement has its roots in the larger movement towards evidence-based-practices.many large university institutions are now starting to offer free or almost free full courses, through open education, such as harvard, mit and berkeley teaming up to form edx. other universities offering open education are prestigious private universities such as stanford, princeton, duke, johns hopkins, the university of pennsylvania, and caltech, as well as notable public universities including tsinghua, peking, edinburgh, university of michigan, and university of virginia.open education has been called the biggest change in the way people learn since the printing press. despite favourable studies on effectiveness, many people may still desire to choose traditional campus education for social and cultural reasons.many open universities are working to have the ability to offer students standardized testing and traditional degrees and credentials.the conventional merit-system degree is currently not as common in open education as it is in campus universities, although some open universities do already offer conventional degrees such as the open university in the united kingdom. presently, many of the major open education sources offer their own form of certificate.out of 182 colleges surveyed in 2009 nearly half said tuition for online courses was higher than for campus-based ones.a 2010 meta-analysis found that online and blended educational approaches had better outcomes than methods that used solely face-to-face interaction.the education sector or education system is a group of institutions schools deliver education, with support from the rest of the education system through various elements such as education policies and guidelines 030 agenda for sustainable development, adopted by the united nations since 1909, the percentage of children in the developing world attending school has increased. before then, a small minority of boys attended school. by the start of the twenty-first century, the majority of children in most regions of the world attended school.universal primary education was one of the eight international millennium development goals, towards which progress has been made in the past decade, though barriers still remain. securing charitable funding from prospective donors is one particularly persistent problem. researchers at the overseas development institute have indicated that the main obstacles to funding for education include conflicting donor priorities, an immature aid architecture, and a lack of evidence and advocacy for the issue. additionally, transparency international has identified corruption in the education sector as a major stumbling block to achieving universal primary education in africa. furthermore, demand in the developing world for improved educational access is not as high as foreigners have expected. indigenous governments are reluctant to take on the ongoing costs involved. there is also economic pressure from some parents, who prefer their children to earn money in the short term rather than work towards the long-term benefits of education.a study conducted by the unesco international institute for educational planning indicates that stronger capacities in educational planning and management may have an important spill-over effect on the system as a whole. sustainable capacity development requires complex interventions at the institutional, organizational and individual levels that could be based on some foundational principles:nearly every country now has universal primary education.similarities 008. they are sold at cost or given away based on donations.in africa, the new partnership for africas development  an international development agency project called nabuur.com, started with the support of former american president bill clinton, uses the internet to allow co-operation by individuals on issues of social development.india is developing technologies that will bypass land-based telephone and internet infrastructure to deliver distance learning directly to its students. in 2004, the indian space research organisation launched edusat, a communications satellite providing access to educational materials that can reach more of the countrys population at a greatly reduced cost.a survey of literature of the research into low-cost private schools  the polarization was due to disputes around whether the schools are affordable for the poor, reach disadvantaged groups, provide quality education, support or undermine equality, and are financially sustainable. the report examined the main challenges encountered by development organizations which support lcpss. surveys suggest these types of schools are expanding across africa and asia. this success is attributed to excess demand. these surveys found concern for:the report showed some cases of successful voucher where there was an oversupply of quality private places and an efficient administrative authority and of subsidy programs. evaluations of the effectiveness of international support to the sector are rare. addressing regulatory ineffectiveness is a key challenge. emerging approaches stress the importance of understanding the political economy of the market for lcps, specifically how relationships of power and accountability between users, government, and private providers can produce better education outcomes for the poor.educational psychology is the study of how humans learn in educational settings, the effectiveness of educational interventions, the psychology of teaching, and the social psychology of schools as organizations. the terms ""educational psychology"" and ""school psychology"" are often used interchangeably. educational psychology is concerned with the processes of educational attainment in the general population and in sub-populations such as gifted children and those with specific disabilities.educational psychology can in part be understood through its relationship with other disciplines. it is informed primarily by psychology, bearing a relationship to that discipline analogous to the relationship between medicine and biology. educational psychology, in turn, informs a wide range of specialties within educational studies, including instructional design, educational technology, curriculum development, organizational learning, special education and classroom management. educational psychology both draws from and contributes to cognitive science and the learning sciences. in universities, departments of educational psychology are usually housed within faculties of education, possibly accounting for the lack of representation of educational psychology content in introductory psychology textbooks  this effect is also observable in the opposite direction, in that education increases measurable intelligence. studies have shown that while educational attainment is important in predicting intelligence in later life, intelligence at 53 is more closely correlated to intelligence at 8 years old than to educational attainment.there has been much interest in learning modalities and styles over the last two decades. the most commonly employed learning modalities are:other commonly employed modalities include musical, interpersonal, verbal, logical, and intrapersonal.dunn and dunn focused on identifying relevant stimuli that may influence learning and manipulating the school environment, at about the same time as joseph renzulli recommended varying teaching strategies. howard gardner identified a wide range of modalities in his multiple intelligences theories. the myers-briggs type indicator and keirsey temperament sorter, based on the works of jung, focus on understanding how peoples personality affects the way they interact personally, and how this affects the way individuals respond to each other within the learning environment. the work of david kolb and anthony gregorcs type delineator follows a similar but more simplified approach.some theories propose that all individuals benefit from a variety of learning modalities, while others suggest that individuals may have preferred learning styles, learning more easily through visual or kinesthetic experiences. a consequence of the latter theory is that effective teaching should present a variety of teaching methods which cover all three learning modalities so that different students have equal opportunities to learn in a way that is effective for them. guy claxton has questioned the extent that learning styles such as visual, auditory and kinesthetic recent research has argued, ""there is no adequate evidence base to justify incorporating learning styles assessments into general educational practice.""educational neuroscience is an emerging scientific field that brings together researchers in cognitive neuroscience, developmental cognitive neuroscience, educational psychology, educational technology, education theory and other related disciplines to explore the interactions between biological processes and education. researchers in educational neuroscience investigate the neural mechanisms of reading, numerical cognition, attention, and their attendant difficulties including dyslexia, dyscalculia, and adhd as they relate to education. several academic institutions around the world are beginning to devote resources to the establishment of educational neuroscience research.as an academic field, philosophy of education is ""the philosophical study of education and its problems its central subject matter is education, and its methods are those of philosophy"". ""the philosophy of education may be either the philosophy of the process of education or the philosophy of the discipline of education. that is, it may be part of the discipline in the sense of being concerned with the aims, forms, methods, or results of the process of educating or being educated; or it may be metadisciplinary in the sense of being concerned with the concepts, aims, and methods of the discipline."" as such, it is both part of the field of education and a field of applied philosophy, drawing from fields of metaphysics, epistemology, axiology and the philosophical approaches  for example, it might study what constitutes upbringing and education, the values and norms revealed through upbringing and educational practices, the limits and legitimization of education as an academic discipline, and the relation between education theory and practice.there is no broad consensus as to what educations chief aim or aims are or should be. different places, and at different times, have used educational systems for different purposes.  the prussian education system in the 19th century, for example, wanted to turn boys and girls into adults who would serve the states political goals.some authors stress its value to the individual, emphasizing its potential for positively influencing students personal development, promoting autonomy, forming a cultural identity or establishing a career or occupation. other authors emphasize educations contributions to societal purposes, including good citizenship, shaping students into productive members of society, thereby promoting societys general economic development, and preserving cultural values.the purpose of education in a given time and place affects who is taught, what is taught, and how the education system behaves.  for example, in the 21st century, many countries treat education as a positional good. in this competitive approach, people want their own students to get a better education than other students. this approach can lead to unfair treatment of some students, especially those from disadvantaged or marginalized groups. for example, in this system, a citys school system may draw school district boundaries so that nearly all the students in one school are from low-income families, and that nearly all the students in the neighboring schools come from more affluent families, even though concentrating low-income students in one school results in worse educational achievement for the entire school system.in formal education, a curriculum is the set of courses and their content offered at a school or university. as an idea, curriculum stems from the latin word for race course, referring to the course of deeds and experiences through which children grow to become mature adults. a curriculum is prescriptive and is based on a more general syllabus which merely specifies what topics must be understood and to what level to achieve a particular grade or standard.an academic discipline is a branch of knowledge which is formally taught, either at the university 020, the covid-19 pandemic has created the largest disruption of education systems in history, affecting nearly 1.6 billion learners in more than 190 countries and all continents. closures of schools and other learning spaces have impacted 94 percent of the world020 there were 27 countries that had localized school closures. in the united states, an estimated 55.1 million students were forced to cease in-person instruction as of april 10, 2020. see impact of the covid-19 pandemic on education. a switch to a virtual learning experience is particularly challenging for families that cannot afford the proper technology, such as laptops, printers, or a reliable internet connection. when schools close, parents are often asked to facilitate the learning of children at home and can struggle to perform this task. this is especially true for parents with limited education and resources. students who require special education have found it difficult to progress through the curriculum without obtaining the education tools that they require. polling suggests that schools that serve a majority of students of color are far less likely to have access to the technology needed for remote learning. only 66% of black households in the u.s. had home broadband service in 2019. only 45% of black americans owned a desktop or laptop computer in 2015. without access to the internet or a computer, black parents are at a disadvantage in educating their children. the mental health of students has been greatly impacted due to the pandemic. it is estimated that three in ten participating in school at home have had their emotional and mental health negatively impacted. similarly, the social lives of students have also been upended and this has been detrimental to the health of students worldwide which has also negatively impacted educational quality. this will be an issue for years to come. covid-19 has shined a light on opportunity gaps and it will be incumbent upon educators and policymakers to direct the necessary resources to mitigating these disparities in the coming years.",1,0
"borat: cultural learnings of america for make benefit glorious nation of kazakhstan is a 2006 british-american mockumentary comedy film directed by larry charles and starring sacha baron cohen. baron cohen stars as borat sagdiyev, a fictitious kazakhstani journalist who travels through the united states to make a documentary which features real-life interactions with americans. much of the film features unscripted vignettes of borat interviewing and interacting with real-life americans who believe he is a foreigner with little or no understanding of american customs. it is the second of four films built around baron cohens characters from da ali g show  most scenes in the film were unscripted. in most cases, the films participants were given no warning on what they would be taking part in except for being asked to sign release forms agreeing not to take legal action against the films producers.principal photography was already underway in january 2005, when baron cohen caused a near riot in what would ultimately be the rodeo scene in the final cut of the film. an interview with baron cohen by rolling stone indicated that more than 400 hours of footage had been shot for the film.the kazakhstan depicted in the film has little or no relationship with the actual country, and the producers explicitly deny attempting to ""convey the actual beliefs, practices or behaviour of anyone associated with kazakhstan"" in the ""all persons fictitious"" disclaimer. the scenes showing borats home village were filmed in the romanian village of glod, which is primarily roma. the name of borats neighbour, nursultan tulyakbay, is a cross between the names of former kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev and opposition politician zharmakhan tuyakbay.no kazakh language is heard in the film. borats neighbours in kazakhstan were portrayed by romani people, who were unaware of the films subject until after it premiered. sacha baron cohen the dvd included several deleted scenes from the film, including borat being questioned by police at a traffic stop, visiting an animal shelter to adopt a dog that could protect him from jews, getting a massage at a hotel, and visiting an american doctor. there is also a montage of scenes cut from the film, including borat taking a job at krystal and taking part in an american civil war reenactment. the deleted scenes menu also includes an intentionally tedious supermarket sequence with an unusually patient supermarket owner  in an interview, one of the films writers, dan mazer, confirmed that there was a scene filmed but cut in which borat observed the shooting of actual pornography with actress brooke banner. mazer stated that the scene was deleted so as not to compete with the naked hotel fight, but hinted it might be included in future dvd releases. in a 2016 interview on conan, cohen elaborated on the deleted scene in which he was featured in the pornographic film.borat was previewed at the 2006 comic-con international in san diego, california, on 21 july 2006. its first screening to a paying audience was during the 2006 traverse city film festival, where it won the excellence in filmmaking award.the films official debut was in toronto on 7 september 2006, at the ryerson university theatre during the toronto international film festival. baron cohen arrived in character as borat in a cart pulled by women dressed as peasants. twenty minutes into the showing, however, the projector broke. baron cohen performed an impromptu act to keep the audience amused, but ultimately all attempts to fix the equipment failed. the film was successfully screened the following night, with dustin hoffman in attendance.in israel, a proposed poster depicting borat in a sling bikini was rejected by the films advertising firm in favour of one showing him in his usual suit. the film helped popularize the term ""mankini"".the film opened at no. 1 in the box office, maintaining first place for two weeks straight. the film earned more in the second week borat had its public release on 1 november 2006 in belgium. by 3 november 2006, it had opened in the united states and canada, as well as in 14 european countries. upon its release, it was a massive hit, taking in us$26.4 million in its opening weekend, the highest ever in the united states and canada for a film released in fewer than 1,000 cinemas until hannah montana & miley cyrus: best of both worlds concert in 2008. however, its opening day  was larger than that of the hannah montana concert  leaving borat with the record of the highest opening day gross for a film released in fewer than 1,000 cinemas. on its second weekend, borat surpassed its opening with a total of us$29 million.borat received widespread critical acclaim. on rotten tomatoes the film has a score of 91% based on reviews from 222 critics, with an average rating of 8.02/10. the websites consensus for the film reads, ""part satire, part shockumentary, borat gets high-fives almost all-around for being offensive in the funniest possible way. jagshemash!"" on metacritic, the film has a score of 89 out of 100 based on 38 critics, indicating ""universal acclaim"". audiences surveyed by cinemascore gave the film a grade b+ on scale of a to f.ty burr spoke positively about the film in his review for the boston globe, calling it ""silliness at its most trenchant"" and declaring it the funniest film of the year. michael medved gave it 3.5 out of 4 stars, calling it ""simultaneously hilarious and cringe-inducing, full of ingenious bits that youll want to describe to your friends and then laugh all over again when you do."" peter travers of rolling stone wrote: ""you wont know what outrageous fun is until you see borat. high-five!"" in an article about the changing face of comedy, the atlantic said that it ""may be the funniest film in a decade"".the guardian included the film in its list of ten best films of the noughties one negative review came from american critic joe queenan, who went as far as to call baron cohen an ""odious twit"". in an article for slate, writer christopher hitchens offered a counter-argument to suggestions of anti-americanism in the film. hitchens suggested instead that the film demonstrated amazing tolerance by the films unknowing subjects, especially citing the reactions of the guests in the southern dinner scene to borats behaviour.by posting scenes from the film on youtube, borat was also exposed by viral communication. this triggered discussions on different national identities american audiences embraced the film, which played to sold-out crowds at many showings on its opening, despite having been shown on only 837 screens. borat debuted at no. 1 on its opening weekend, with a total gross of $26.4 million, beating its competitors flushed away and the santa clause 3: the escape clause. the cinema average for the films opening weekend was an estimated $31,511, topping star wars:

ultimately went to the departed. it was also nominated for a golden globe award under the category of best motion picture 006, and it was nominated for the writers guild of america award for best adapted screenplay.baron cohen won the golden globe award for best actor in a motion picture 006after the films release, dharma arthur, a news producer for wapt in jackson, mississippi, wrote a letter to newsweek saying that borats appearance on the station had led to her losing her job: ""because of him, my boss lost faith in my abilities and second-guessed everything i did thereafter. how upsetting that a man who leaves so much harm in his path is applauded as a comedic genius."" although arthur has said she was fired from the show, she told the associated press that she resigned from the station. she said that she checked a public relations website that borats producers gave her before booking him.in news coverage that aired in january 2005 of the filming of the rodeo scene, bobby rowe, producer of the salem, virginia rodeo depicted in the film, stated that he felt he had been the victim of a hoax. he said that ""months"" prior to the appearance, he had been approached by someone from ""one america, a california-based film company that was reportedly doing a documentary on a russian immigrant""; he agreed to permit the ""immigrant"" to sing the u.s. national anthem after listening to a tape. after the films release, rowe said, ""some people come up and say, hey, you made the big time; ive made the big time, but not in the way i want it.""cindy streit, borats etiquette consultant, subsequently hired high-profile attorney gloria allred, who demanded that the california attorney general investigate fraud allegedly committed by baron cohen and the films producers.the salon arts & entertainment site quotes the behars  the boston globe also interviewed the couple, saying they considered the film more anti-muslim than anti-semitic and had feared that baron cohen and his ensemble might be filming pornography in the house.the feminists from veteran feminists of america the new york post had reported in november 2006 that pamela anderson filed for divorce from her husband kid rock after he reacted unfavourably to the film during a screening. the posts article specifically claimed he had said of her role in the film, ""youre nothing but a whore! youre a slut! how could you do that movie?"" in an interview on the howard stern show, anderson confirmed that rock was upset by her appearance in the film, but did not confirm that this was the cause of the separation.the villagers of glod, romania, took legal action against the producers of borat, complaining that they were lied to about the nature of the filming and they were portrayed as incestuous and ignorant. some said they were paid only three lei  the residents asked for $38 million in damages. one lawsuit was thrown out by u.s. district judge loretta preska in a hearing in early december 2006 on the ground that the allegations in the complaint were too vague. despite this, the litigants planned to refile. in april 2008, the case was dismissed again, citing insufficient evidence.two of the university of south carolina fraternity brothers who appeared in the film, justin seay and christopher rotunda, sued the producers, claiming defamation. the suit by seay and rotunda was dismissed in february 2007. the students had also sought an injunction to prevent the dvd release of the film, which was denied.another lawsuit was filed by a south carolina resident who said he was accosted by baron cohen the macedonian romani singer esma red6,000 compensation, since it turned out that baron cohen had received permission from her production house to use the song, which she had not been notified about.felix cedeno, a 31-year-old american, sued 20th century fox for $2.25 million, after he was filmed as part of a scene where a live chicken fell out of borats suitcase on the subway. cedeno later dropped the suit and received nothing.baltimore resident michael psenicska sought more than $100,000 in damages from baron cohen, 20th century fox, and other parties. psenicska008.jeffrey lemerond, who was shown running and yelling, ""get away"" as borat attempted to hug strangers on a new york street, filed a legal case claiming his image was used in the film illegally, and that he suffered ""public ridicule, degradation and humiliation"" as a result. the case was dismissed.baron cohen reacted to these suits by commenting: ""some of the letters i get are quite unusual, like the one where the lawyer informed me im about to be sued for $100,000 and at the end says, p.s. loved the movie. can you sign a poster for my son jeremy?""the government of kazakhstan at first denounced borat. in 2005, following borats appearance at the mtv movie awards, the countrys foreign ministry threatened to sue sacha baron cohen, and borats kazakh-based website, www.borat.kz, was taken down. kazakhstan also launched a multi-million dollar ""heart of eurasia"" campaign to counter the borat effect; baron cohen replied by denouncing the campaign at an in-character press conference in front of the white house as the propaganda of the ""evil nitwits"" of uzbekistan. uzbekistan is, throughout the film, referred to by borat as his nations second leading problem, with the first being the jews. in november 2006, kazakh tv personality jantemir baimukhamedov travelled to london with the stated aim of presenting baron cohen with horse meat and horse urine, which were claimed by borat to be the national food and drink of kazakhstan, although he was unable to organise a meeting with him.in 2006, gemini films, the central asian distributor of 20th century fox, complied with a kazakh government request to not release the film. that year, kazakh ambassador to the united kingdom erlan idrissov, after viewing the film, called parts of the film funny and wrote that the film had ""placed kazakhstan on the map"". by 2012, kazakh foreign minister yerzhan kazykhanov attributed a great rise in tourism to his country016, ten years after the films release, many of his colleagues in the kazakh media saw the character of borat as a valuable pr opportunity. according to him some of the kazakhs who were most upset by the film were students studying in the us and the uk, who understood the films satirical intent but felt that their non-kazakh peers were taking the film at face value as an accurate portrayal of the country. he suggested that interest in the character inside the country faded once kazakhs grasped that the film was designed to ""get an outsiders view of the us and reveal the prejudices of the americans who borat interacts with... functioning as a sort of 21st century alexis de tocqueville"".the kazakh tabloid karavan declared borat to be the best film of the year, having had a reviewer see the film at a screening in vienna. the paper said that it was ""certainly not an anti-kazakh, anti-romanian or anti-semitic"" film, but rather ""cruelly anti-american ... amazingly funny and sad at the same time."" another favorable word came from kazakh novelist sapabek asip-uly, who suggested baron cohen be nominated for the annual award bestowed by the kazakh club of art patrons. in a letter published by the newspaper vremya, asip-uly wrote, "" has managed to spark an immense interest of the whole world in kazakhstan012, the parody national anthem from the films soundtrack, which acclaims kazakhstan for its high-quality potassium exports and having the second-cleanest prostitutes in the region, was mistakenly played at the emir of kuwait international shooting grand prix. the gold medalist, mariya dmitriyenko, stood on the dais while the entire parody was played. the team complained, and the award ceremony was restaged. the incident apparently resulted from the wrong song being downloaded from the internet.the european center for antiziganism research, which works against negative attitudes toward romani people, filed a complaint with german prosecutors on 18 october 2006, based on borats references to gypsies in his film. the complaint accuses him of defamation and inciting violence against an ethnic group. as a consequence, 20th century fox declared that it would remove all parts referring to romani people from trailers shown on german television as well as on the films website.before the release of the film, the anti-defamation league  both baron cohen  but the adl expressed concern that some audiences might remain oblivious to this aspect of the films humor, while ""some may even find it reinforcing their bigotry"".the film was banned in the entire arab world except for lebanon and the united arab emirates  yousuf abdul hamid, a film censor for dubai in the united arab emirates, called the film ""vile, gross and extremely ridiculous"". the censor said that he and his colleagues had walked out on their screening before it had ended, and that only half an hour of the film would be left once all the offensive scenes were removed.the soundtrack for borat was released on the itunes store on 24 october 2006, and in shops on 31 october 2006. the album included music from the film, five tracks entitled ""dialoguing excerpt from moviefilm"", as well as the controversial anti-semitic song ""in my country there is problem"" from da ali g show.the folk music included in the soundtrack has no connection to the authentic music of kazakhstan. the album features songs by romani and balkan artists  special features include deleted scenes, faux advertisements for the soundtrack album, and a complete russian language translation audio track using a professional dubbing cast, along with the english, french, and spanish language tracks common on region 1. there is also a choice of hebrew, but this is merely a joke; choosing the hebrew language option results in a warning screen reading ""you have been trapped, jew!"" which warns the viewer not to change his shape and to keep his claws where they can be seen, again playing on the anti-semitism supposedly prevalent in borats version of kazakhstan. it also includes footage of borats publicity tour for the film, with baron cohen in character as borat on the tonight show with jay leno, late night with conan obrien, the toronto international film festival, and saturday night live. the bonus features conclude with a news segment from a virginia tv station about borats night at the rodeo, complete with an interview with rodeo owner bobby rowe.as a play on the copyright infringement common in the former soviet union, the packaging of the region 1  the umd version is similar to the dvd, even being labelled a ""umd-r""  borat was released on blu-ray in the us on 9 november 2009 as a region free disc.in 2009, the film br million.rupert murdoch announced in early february 2007 that baron cohen had signed on to do another borat film with fox. however, this was contradicted by an interview in which baron cohen himself stated that borat was to be discontinued, as he was now too well known to avoid detection as he did in the film and on da ali g show. a spokesman for fox later stated that it was too early to begin planning such a film, although they were open to the idea.baron cohen subsequently announced that he was ""killing off"" the characters of borat and ali g because they were now so famous he could no longer trick people. even though he decided to retire the characters, on 26 february 2014, he brought them back for the fxx series ali g: rezurection, a collection of the sketches from all 18 episodes of da ali g show, including new footage of baron cohen in-character as ali g, who is portrayed as the presenter of the show.baron cohen revived the character of borat in december 2015 on the late night talk show jimmy kimmel live! to premiere the new trailer for his movie grimsby.in september 2020, a direct sequel, titled borat subsequent moviefilm, was officially confirmed to have been secretly filmed, completed and screened during the covid-19 pandemic a few weeks after baron cohen was spotted driving a pick-up truck in character as borat around los angeles. that same month, amazon studios acquired distribution rights to the film and released it on 23 october 2020.",1,0

"stress, either physiological or biological, is an organisms response to a stressor such as an environmental condition. stress is the bodys method of reacting to a condition such as a threat, challenge or physical and psychological barrier. stimuli that alter an organisms environment are responded to by multiple systems in the body. in humans and most mammals, the autonomic nervous system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal the sympathoadrenal medullary through these mechanisms, stress can alter memory functions, reward, immune function, metabolism and susceptibility to diseases. disease risk is particularly pertinent to mental illnesses, whereby chronic or severe stress remains a common risk factor for several mental illnesses. one system suggests there are five types of stress labeled ""acute time-limited stressors"", ""brief naturalistic stressors"", ""stressful event sequences"", ""chronic stressors"", and ""distant stressors"". an acute time-limited stressor involves a short-term challenge, while a brief  natural stressor involves an event that is normal but nevertheless challenging. a stressful event sequence is a stressor that occurs, and then continues to yield stress into the immediate future. a chronic stressor involves exposure to a long-term stressor, and a distant stressor is a stressor that is not immediate.chronic stress and a lack of coping resources available or used by an individual can often lead to the development of psychological issues such as delusions, depression and anxiety  this is particularly true regarding chronic stressors. these are stressors that may not be as intense as an acute stressor like a natural disaster or a major accident, but they persist over longer periods of time. these types of stressors tend to have a more negative effect on health because they are sustained and thus require the bodys physiological response to occur daily.this depletes the bodys energy more quickly and usually occurs over long periods of time, especially when these microstressors cannot be avoided when humans are under chronic stress, permanent changes in their physiological, emotional, and behavioral responses may occur. chronic stress can include events such as caring for a spouse with dementia, or may result from brief focal events that have long term effects, such as experiencing a sexual assault. studies have also shown that psychological stress may directly contribute to the disproportionately high rates of coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality and its etiologic risk factors. specifically, acute and chronic stress have been shown to raise serum lipids and are associated with clinical coronary events.however, it is possible for individuals to exhibit hardiness0s. it is a form of the middle english destresse, derived via old french from the latin stringere, ""to draw tight"". the word had long been in use in physics to refer to the internal distribution of a force exerted on a material body, resulting in strain. in the 1920s and 30s, biological and psychological circles occasionally used the term to refer to a mental strain or to a harmful environmental agent that could cause illness.walter cannon used it in 1926 to refer to external factors that disrupted what he called homeostasis. but ""...stress as an explanation of lived experience is absent from both lay and expert life narratives before the 1930s"". physiological stress represents a wide range of physical responses that occur as a direct effect of a stressor causing an upset in the homeostasis of the body. upon immediate disruption of either psychological or physical equilibrium the body responds by stimulating the nervous, endocrine, and immune systems. the reaction of these systems causes a number of physical changes that have both short- and long-term effects on the body.the holmes and rahe stress scale was developed as a method of assessing the risk of disease from life changes. the scale lists both positive and negative changes that elicit stress. these include things such as a major holiday or marriage, or death of a spouse and firing from a job.homeostasis is a concept central to the idea of stress. in biology, most biochemical processes strive to maintain equilibrium  factors causing an organisms condition to diverge too far from homeostasis can be experienced as stress. a life-threatening situation such as a major physical trauma or prolonged starvation can greatly disrupt homeostasis. on the other hand, an organisms attempt at restoring conditions back to or near homeostasis, often consuming energy and natural resources, can also be interpreted as stress.the ambiguity in defining this phenomenon was first recognized by hans selye first to use the term in a biological context, selye continued to define stress as ""the non-specific response of the body to any demand placed upon it"". neuroscientists such as bruce mcewen and jaap koolhaas believe that stress, based on years of empirical research, ""should be restricted to conditions where an environmental demand exceeds the natural regulatory capacity of an organism"". indeed, in 1995 toates already defined stress as a ""chronic state that arises only when defense mechanisms are either being chronically stretched or are actually failing,"" while according to ursin  which also puts stress into the broader context of cognitive-consistency theory.stress can have many profound effects on the human biological systems. biology primarily attempts to explain major concepts of stress using a stimulus-response paradigm, broadly comparable to how a psychobiological sensory system operates. the central nervous system stress, either severe, acute stress or chronic low-grade stress may induce abnormalities in three principal regulatory systems in the body: serotonin systems, catecholamine systems, and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis. aggressive behavior has also been associated with abnormalities in these systems.the brain endocrine interactions are relevant in the translation of stress into physiological and psychological changes. the autonomic nervous system the ans is composed of the parasympathetic nervous system and sympathetic nervous system, two branches that are both tonically active with opposing activities. the ans directly innervates tissue through the postganglionic nerves, which is controlled by preganglionic neurons originating in the intermediolateral cell column. the ans receives inputs from the medulla, hypothalamus, limbic system, prefrontal cortex, midbrain and monoamine nuclei.the activity of the sympathetic nervous system drives what is called the ""fight or flight"" response. the fight or flight response to emergency or stress involves mydriasis, increased heart rate and force contraction, vasoconstriction, bronchodilation, glycogenolysis, gluconeogenesis, lipolysis, sweating, decreased motility of the digestive system, secretion of the epinephrine and cortisol from the adrenal medulla, and relaxation of the bladder wall. the parasympathetic nervous response, ""rest and digest"", involves return to maintaining homeostasis, and involves miosis, bronchoconstriction, increased activity of the digestive system, and contraction of the bladder walls. complex relationships between protective and vulnerability factors on the effect of childhood home stress on psychological illness, cardiovascular illness and adaption have been observed. ans related mechanisms are thought to contribute to increased risk of cardiovascular disease after major stressful events.the hpa axis is a neuroendocrine system that mediates a stress response. neurons in the hypothalamus, particularly the paraventricular nucleus, release vasopressin and corticotropin releasing hormone, which travel through the hypophysial portal vessel where they travel to and bind to the corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor on the anterior pituitary gland. multiple crh peptides have been identified, and receptors have been identified on multiple areas of the brain, including the amygdala. crh is the main regulatory molecule of the release of acth.the secretion of acth into systemic circulation allows it to bind to and activate melanocortin receptor, where it stimulates the release of steroid hormones. steroid hormones bind to glucocorticoid receptors in the brain, providing negative feedback by reducing acth release. some evidence supports a second long term feedback that is non-sensitive to cortisol secretion. the pvn of the hypothalamus receives inputs from the nucleus of the solitary tract, and lamina terminalis. through these inputs, it receives and can respond to changes in blood.the pvn innervation from the brain stem nuclei, particularly the noradrenergic nuclei stimulate crh release. other regions of the hypothalamus both directly and indirectly inhibit hpa axis activity. hypothalamic neurons involved in regulating energy balance also influence hpa axis activity through the release of neurotransmitters such as neuropeptide y, which stimulates hpa axis activity. generally, the amygdala stimulates, and the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus attenuate, hpa axis activity; however, complex relationships do exist between the regions.the immune system may be heavily influenced by stress. the sympathetic nervous system innervates various immunological structures, such as bone marrow and the spleen, allowing for it to regulate immune function. the adrenergic substances released by the sympathetic nervous system can also bind to and influence various immunological cells, further providing a connection between the systems. the hpa axis ultimately results in the release of cortisol, which generally has immunosuppressive effects. however, the effect of stress on the immune system is disputed, and various models have been proposed in an attempt to account for both the supposedly ""immunodeficiency"" linked diseases and diseases involving hyper activation of the immune system. one model proposed to account for this suggests a push towards an imbalance of cellular immunitychronic stress is a term sometimes used to differentiate it from acute stress. definitions differ, and may be along the lines of continual activation of the stress response, stress that causes an allostatic shift in bodily functions, or just as ""prolonged stress"". for example, results of one study demonstrated that individuals who reported relationship conflict lasting one month or longer have a greater risk of developing illness and show slower wound healing. similarly, the effects that acute stressors have on the immune system may be increased when there is perceived stress and/or anxiety due to other events. for example, students who are taking exams show weaker immune responses if they also report stress due to daily hassles. while responses to acute stressors typically do not impose a health burden on young, healthy individuals, chronic stress in older or unhealthy individuals may have long-term effects that are detrimental to health.acute time-limited stressors, or stressors that lasted less than two hours, results in an up regulation of natural immunity and down regulation of specific immunity. this type of stress saw in increase in granulocytes, natural killer cells, iga, interleukin 6, and an increase in cell cytotoxicity. brief naturalistic stressors elicit a shift from th1some studies have observed increased risk of upper respiratory tract infection during chronic life stress. in patients with hiv, increased life stress and cortisol was associated with poorer progression of hiv.a link has been suggested between chronic stress and cardiovascular disease. stress appears to play a role in hypertension, and may further predispose people to other conditions associated with hypertension. stress may also precipitate a more serious, or relapse into abuse of alcohol. stress may also contribute to aging and chronic diseases in aging, such as depression and metabolic disorders.the immune system also plays a role in stress and the early stages of wound healing. it is responsible for preparing the tissue for repair and promoting recruitment of certain cells to the wound area. consistent with the fact that stress alters the production of cytokines, graham et al. found that chronic stress associated with care giving for a person with alzheimers disease leads to delayed wound healing. results indicated that biopsy wounds healed 25% more slowly in the chronically stressed group, or those caring for a person with alzheimers disease.chronic stress has also been shown to impair developmental growth in children by lowering the pituitary glands production of growth hormone, as in children associated with a home environment involving serious marital discord, alcoholism, or child abuse.more generally, prenatal life, infancy, childhood, and adolescence are critical periods in which the vulnerability to stressors is particularly high.chronic stress is seen to affect the parts of the brain where memories are processed through and stored. when people feel stressed, stress hormones get over-secreted, which affects the brain. this secretion is made up of glucocorticoids, including cortisol, which are steroid hormones that the adrenal gland releases, although this can increase storage of flashbulb memories it decreases long-term potentiation  the hippocampus is important in the brain for storing certain kinds of memories and damage to the hippocampus can cause trouble in storing new memories but old memories, memories stored before the damage, are not lost. also high cortisol levels can be tied to the deterioration of the hippocampus and decline of memory that many older adults start to experience with age. these mechanisms and processes may therefore contribute to age-related disease, or originate risk for earlier-onset disorders. for instance, extreme stress chronic stress also shifts learning, forming a preference for habit based learning, and decreased task flexibility and spatial working memory, probably through alterations of the dopaminergic systems. stress may also increase reward associated with food, leading to weight gain and further changes in eating habits. stress may contribute to various disorders, such as fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, depression, and functional somatic syndromes.selye published in year 1975 a model dividing stress into eustress and distress. where stress enhances function responses to stress include adaptation, psychological coping such as stress management, anxiety, and depression. over the long term, distress can lead to diminished health and/or increased propensity to illness; to avoid this, stress must be managed.stress management encompasses techniques intended to equip a person with effective coping mechanisms for dealing with psychological stress, with stress defined as a persons physiological response to an internal or external stimulus that triggers the fight-or-flight response. stress management is effective when a person uses strategies to cope with or alter stressful situations.there are several ways of coping with stress, such as controlling the source of stress or learning to set limits and to say ""no"" to some of the demands that bosses or family members may make.a persons capacity to tolerate the source of stress may be increased by thinking about another topic such as a hobby, listening to music, or spending time in a wilderness.a way to control stress is first dealing with what is causing the stress if it is something the individual has control over. other methods to control stress and reduce it can be: to not procrastinate and leave tasks for the last minute, do things you like, exercise, do breathing routines, go out with friends, and take a break. having support from a loved one also helps a lot in reducing stress.one study showed that the power of having support from a loved one, or just having social support, lowered stress in individual subjects. painful shocks were applied to married womens ankles. in some trials women were able to hold their husbands hand, in other trials they held a strangers hand, and then held no ones hand. when the women were holding their husbands hand, the response was reduced in many brain areas. when holding the strangers hand the response was reduced a little, but not as much as when they were holding their husbands hand. social support helps reduce stress and even more so if the support is from a loved one.lazarus argued that, in order for a psychosocial situation to be stressful, it must be appraised as such. he argued that cognitive processes of appraisal are central in determining whether a situation is potentially threatening, constitutes a harm/loss or a challenge, or is benign.both personal and environmental factors influence this primary appraisal, which then triggers the selection of coping processes. problem-focused coping is directed at managing the problem, whereas emotion-focused coping processes are directed at managing the negative emotions. secondary appraisal refers to the evaluation of the resources available to cope with the problem, and may alter the primary appraisal.in other words, primary appraisal includes the perception of how stressful the problem is and the secondary appraisal of estimating whether one has more than or less than adequate resources to deal with the problem that affects the overall appraisal of stressfulness. further, coping is flexible in that, in general, the individual examines the effectiveness of the coping on the situation; if it is not having the desired effect, s/he will, in general, try different strategies.both negative and positive stressors can lead to stress. the intensity and duration of stress changes depending on the circumstances and emotional condition of the person suffering from it alarm is the first stage, which is divided into two phases: the shock phase and the antishock phase.resistance is the second stage. during this stage, increased secretion of glucocorticoids intensifies the bodys systemic response. glucocorticoids can increase the concentration of glucose, fat, and amino acid in blood. in high doses, one glucocorticoid, cortisol, begins to act similarly to a mineralocorticoid the current usage of the word stress arose out of hans selyes 1930s experiments. he started to use the term to refer not just to the agent but to the state of the organism as it responded and adapted to the environment. his theories of a universal non-specific stress response attracted great interest and contention in academic physiology and he undertook extensive research programs and publication efforts.while the work attracted continued support from advocates of psychosomatic medicine, many in experimental physiology concluded that his concepts were too vague and unmeasurable. during the 1950s, selye turned away from the laboratory to promote his concept through popular books and lecture tours. he wrote for both non-academic physicians and, in an international bestseller entitled stress of life, for the general public.a broad biopsychosocial concept of stress and adaptation offered the promise of helping everyone achieve health and happiness by successfully responding to changing global challenges and the problems of modern civilization. selye coined the term ""eustress"" for positive stress, by contrast to distress. he argued that all people have a natural urge and need to work for their own benefit, a message that found favor with industrialists and governments. he also coined the term stressor to refer to the causative event or stimulus, as opposed to the resulting state of stress.selye was in contact with the tobacco industry from 1958 and they were undeclared allies in litigation and the promotion of the concept of stress, clouding the link between smoking and cancer, and portraying smoking as a ""diversion"", or in selyes concept a ""deviation"", from environmental stress.from the late 1960s, academic psychologists started to adopt selyes concept; they sought to quantify ""life stress"" by scoring ""significant life events"", and a large amount of research was undertaken to examine links between stress and disease of all kinds. by the late 1970s, stress had become the medical area of greatest concern to the general population, and more basic research was called for to better address the issue. there was also renewed laboratory research into the neuroendocrine, molecular, and immunological bases of stress, conceived as a useful heuristic not necessarily tied to selyes original hypotheses. the us military became a key center of stress research, attempting to understand and reduce combat neurosis and psychiatric casualties.the psychiatric diagnosis post-traumatic stress disorder  ptsd was considered a severe and ongoing emotional reaction to an extreme psychological trauma, and as such often associated with soldiers, police officers, and other emergency personnel. the stressor may involve threat to life the american psychological associations 2015 stress in america study found that nationwide stress is on the rise and that the three leading sources of stress were ""money"", ""family responsibility"", and ""work"".",1,0
"traditions by regiontraditions by schooltraditions by religionlogic  is the systematic study of valid rules of inference, i.e. the relations that lead to the acceptance of one proposition there is no universal agreement as to the exact definition and boundaries of logic, hence the issue still remains one of the main subjects of research and debates in the field of philosophy of logic  however, it has traditionally included the classification of arguments; the systematic exposition of the logical forms; the validity and soundness of deductive reasoning; the strength of inductive reasoning; the study of formal proofs and inference in ordinary discourse, inferences may be signified by words such as therefore, thus, hence, ergo, and so on.historically, logic has been studied in philosophy the concepts of logical form and argument are central to logic.an argument is constructed by applying one of the forms of the different types of logical reasoning: deductive, inductive, and abductive. in deduction, the validity of an argument is determined solely by its logical form, not its content, whereas the soundness requires both validity and that all the given premises are actually true.completeness, consistency, decidability, and expressivity, are further fundamental concepts in logic. the categorization of the logical systems and of their properties has led to the emergence of a metatheory of logic known as metalogic. however, agreement on what logic actually is has remained elusive, although the field of universal logic has studied the common structure of logics.logic is generally considered formal when it analyzes and represents the form of any valid argument type. the form of an argument is displayed by representing its sentences in the formal grammar and symbolism of a logical language to make its content usable in formal inference. simply put, to formalize simply means to translate english sentences into the language of logic.this is called showing the logical form of the argument. it is necessary because indicative sentences of ordinary language show a considerable variety of form and complexity that makes their use in inference impractical. it requires, first, ignoring those grammatical features irrelevant to logic  according to the followers of aristotle the validity of an argument depends upon the meaning, or semantics, of the sentences that make it up.aristotles six organon, especially de interpretatione, gives a cursory outline of semantics which the scholastic logicians, particularly in the thirteenth and fourteenth century, developed into a complex and sophisticated theory, called supposition theory. this showed how the truth of simple sentences, expressed schematically, depend on how the terms supposit, or stand for, certain extra-linguistic items. for example, in part ii of his summa logicae, william of ockham presents a comprehensive account of the necessary and sufficient conditions for the truth of simple sentences, in order to show which arguments are valid and which are not.  thus ""every a is b is true if and only if there is something for which a stands, and there is nothing for which a stands, for which b does not also stand.""early modern logic defined semantics purely as a relation between ideas. antoine arnauld in the port royal-logic, says that after conceiving things by our ideas, we compare these ideas, and, finding that some belong together and some do not, we unite or separate them. this is called affirming or denying, and in general judging. thus truth and falsity are no more than the agreement or disagreement of ideas. this suggests obvious difficulties, leading locke to distinguish between real truth, when our ideas have real existence and imaginary or verbal truth, where ideas like harpies or centaurs exist only in the mind. this view, known as psychologism, was taken to the extreme in the nineteenth century, and is generally held by modern logicians to signify a low point in the decline of logic before the twentieth century.modern semantics is in some ways closer to the medieval view, in rejecting such psychological truth-conditions. however, the introduction of quantification, needed to solve the problem of multiple generality, rendered impossible the kind of subject-predicate analysis that underlies medieval semantics. the main modern approach is model-theoretic semantics, based on alfred tarskis semantic theory of truth. the approach assumes that the meaning of the various parts of the propositions are given by the possible ways we can give a recursively specified group of interpretation functions from them to some predefined domain of discourse: an interpretation of first-order predicate logic is given by a mapping from terms to a universe of individuals, and a mapping from propositions to the truth values ""true"" and ""false"".  model-theoretic semantics is one of the fundamental concepts of model theory. modern semantics also admits rival approaches, such as the proof-theoretic semantics that associates the meaning of propositions with the roles that they can play in inferences, an approach that ultimately derives from the work of gerhard gentzen on structural proof theory and is heavily influenced by ludwig wittgensteins later philosophy, especially his aphorism ""meaning is use.""inference is not to be confused with implication. an implication is a sentence of the form if p then q, and can be true or false. the stoic logician philo of megara was the first to define the truth conditions of such an implication: false only when the antecedent p is true and the consequent q is false, in all other cases true. an inference, on the other hand, consists of two separately asserted propositions of the form p therefore q. an inference is not true or false, but valid or invalid. however, there is a connection between implication and inference, as follows: if the implication if p then q is true, the inference p therefore q is valid. this was given an apparently paradoxical formulation by philo, who said that the implication if it is day, it is night is true only at night, so the inference it is day, therefore it is night is valid in the night, but not in the day.the theory of inference , and reductio ad absurdum  it consists of an alphabet, a language over the alphabet to construct sentences, and a rule for deriving sentences. among the important properties that logical systems can have are:some logical systems do not have all these properties. as an example, kurt g3, william of ockhams influential summa logicae was released. by the 18th century, the structured approach to arguments had degenerated and fallen out of favour, as depicted in holbergs satirical play erasmus montanus.the chinese logical philosopher gongsun long  in china, the tradition of scholarly investigation into logic, however, was repressed by the qin dynasty following the legalist philosophy of han feizi.in india, the anviksiki school of logic was founded by medh4, indian logic attracted the attention of many western scholars, and has had an influence on important 19th-century logicians such as charles babbage, augustus de morgan, and george boole. in the 20th century, western philosophers like stanislaw schayer and klaus glashoff have explored indian logic more extensively.the syllogistic logic developed by aristotle predominated in the west until the mid-19th century, when interest in the foundations of mathematics stimulated the development of symbolic logic  introducing symbolic logic and the principles of what is now known as boolean logic. in 1879, gottlob frege published begriffsschrift, which inaugurated modern logic with the invention of quantifier notation, reconciling the aristotelian and stoic logics in a broader system, and solving such problems for which aristotelian logic was impotent, such as the problem of multiple generality. from 1910 to 1913, alfred north whitehead and bertrand russell published principia mathematica on the foundations of mathematics, attempting to derive mathematical truths from axioms and inference rules in symbolic logic. in 1931, g0th century jan ukasiewicz investigated the extension of the traditional true/false values to include a third value, ""possible""  a minor modification of the ternary logic was later introduced in a sibling ternary logic model proposed by stephen cole kleene. kleenes system differs from the ukasiewiczs logic with respect to an outcome of the implication. the former assumes that the operator of implication between two hypotheses produces a hypothesis.logics such as fuzzy logic have since been devised with an infinite number of ""degrees of truth"", represented by a real number between 0 and 1.intuitionistic logic was proposed by l.e.j. brouwer as the correct logic for reasoning about mathematics, based upon his rejection of the law of the excluded middle as part of his intuitionism. brouwer rejected formalization in mathematics, but his student arend heyting studied intuitionistic logic formally, as did gerhard gentzen. intuitionistic logic is of great interest to computer scientists, as it is a constructive logic and sees many applications, such as extracting verified programs from proofs and influencing the design of programming languages through the formulae-as-types correspondence.modal logic is not truth conditional, and so it has often been proposed as a non-classical logic. however, modal logic is normally formalized with the principle of the excluded middle, and its relational semantics is bivalent, so this inclusion is disputable.what is the epistemological status of the laws of logic? what sort of argument is appropriate for criticizing purported principles of logic? in an influential paper entitled ""is logic empirical?"" hilary putnam, building on a suggestion of w. v. quine, argued that in general the facts of propositional logic have a similar epistemological status as facts about the physical universe, for example as the laws of mechanics or of general relativity, and in particular that what physicists have learned about quantum mechanics provides a compelling case for abandoning certain familiar principles of classical logic: if we want to be realists about the physical phenomena described by quantum theory, then we should abandon the principle of distributivity, substituting for classical logic the quantum logic proposed by garrett birkhoff and john von neumann.another paper of the same name by michael dummett argues that putnams desire for realism mandates the law of distributivity. distributivity of logic is essential for the realists understanding of how propositions are true of the world in just the same way as he has argued the principle of bivalence is. in this way, the question, ""is logic empirical?"" can be seen to lead naturally into the fundamental controversy in metaphysics on realism versus anti-realism.the notion of implication formalized in classical logic does not comfortably translate into natural language by means of ""if+2=5, which are puzzling because natural language does not support the principle of explosion. eliminating this class of paradoxes was the reason for c. i. lewiss formulation of strict implication, which eventually led to more radically revisionist logics such as relevance logic.the second class of paradoxes involves redundant premises, falsely suggesting that we know the succedent because of the antecedent: thus ""if that man gets elected, granny will die"" is materially true since granny is mortal, regardless of the mans election prospects. such sentences violate the gricean maxim of relevance, and can be modelled by logics that reject the principle of monotonicity of entailment, such as relevance logic.georg wilhelm friedrich hegel was deeply critical of any simplified notion of the law of non-contradiction. it was based on gottfried wilhelm leibnizs idea that this law of logic also requires a sufficient ground to specify from what point of view the philosophical vein of various kinds of skepticism contains many kinds of doubt and rejection of the various bases on which logic rests, such as the idea of logical form, correct inference, or meaning, typically leading to the conclusion that there are no logical truths. this is in contrast with the usual views in philosophical skepticism, where logic directs skeptical enquiry to doubt received wisdoms, as in the work of sextus empiricus.friedrich nietzsche provides a strong example of the rejection of the usual basis of logic: his radical rejection of idealization led him to reject truth as a ""...\x80\x94and accuse nietzsche of not even having a coherent perspective, let alone a theory of knowledge. georg luk\xc3\xa1cs, in his book the destruction of reason, asserts that, ""were we to study nietzsches statements in this area from a logico-philosophical angle, we would be confronted by a dizzy chaos of the most lurid assertions, arbitrary and violently incompatible."" bertrand russell described nietzsches irrational claims with ""he is fond of expressing himself paradoxically and with a view to shocking conventional readers"" in his book a history of western philosophy.",1,0
"capital punishment, also known as the death penalty, is a government-sanctioned practice whereby a person is put to death by the state as a punishment for a crime. the sentence ordering that someone be punished in such a manner is referred to as a death sentence, whereas the act of carrying out such a sentence is known as an execution. a prisoner who has been sentenced to death and is awaiting execution is referred to as condemned, and is said in some countries to be on ""death row"". crimes that are punishable by death are known as capital crimes, capital offences or capital felonies, and vary depending on the jurisdiction, but commonly include serious offences such as murder, mass murder, aggravated cases of rape, child rape, child sexual abuse, terrorism, treason, espionage, sedition, offences against the state  but executions can done by various other methods, such as hanging, shooting, lethal injection, stoning, electrocution and gassing.fifty-six countries retain capital punishment, 106 countries have completely abolished it de jure for all crimes, eight have abolished it for ordinary crimes  although most nations have abolished capital punishment, over 60% of the worlds population live in countries where the death penalty is retained, such as china, india, the united states, indonesia, pakistan, bangladesh, nigeria, ethiopia, egypt, saudi arabia, iran, and among almost all islamic countries, as well as in japan, south korea, taiwan, and sri lanka. china is believed to execute more people than all other countries combined.capital punishment is a matter of active controversy in several countries and states, and positions can vary within a single political ideology or cultural region. in the european union  the council of europe, which has 47 member states, has sought to abolish the use of the death penalty by its members absolutely, through protocol 13 of the european convention on human rights. however, this only affects those member states which have signed and ratified it, and they do not include armenia, russia, and azerbaijan. the united nations general assembly has adopted, throughout the years from 2007 to 2018, seven non-binding resolutions calling for a global moratorium on executions, with a view to eventual abolition.execution of criminals and dissidents has been used by nearly all societies since the beginning of civilizations on earth. until the nineteenth century, without developed prison systems, there was frequently no workable alternative to ensure deterrence and incapacitation of criminals. in pre-modern times the executions themselves often involved torture with cruel and painful methods, such as the breaking wheel, keelhauling, sawing, hanging, drawing, and quartering, brazen bull, burning at the stake, flaying, slow slicing, boiling alive, impalement, mazzatello, blowing from a gun, schwedentrunk, blood eagle, and scaphism.the use of formal execution extends to the beginning of recorded history. most historical records and various primitive tribal practices indicate that the death penalty was a part of their justice system. communal punishments for wrongdoing generally included blood money compensation by the wrongdoer, corporal punishment, shunning, banishment and execution. in tribal societies, compensation and shunning were often considered enough as a form of justice. the response to crimes committed by neighbouring tribes, clans or communities included a formal apology, compensation, blood feuds, and tribal warfare.a blood feud or vendetta occurs when arbitration between families or tribes fails or an arbitration system is non-existent. this form of justice was common before the emergence of an arbitration system based on state or organized religion. it may result from crime, land disputes or a code of honour. ""acts of retaliation underscore the ability of the social collective to defend itself and demonstrate to enemies in most countries that practise capital punishment, it is now reserved for murder, terrorism, war crimes, espionage, treason, or as part of military justice.  in some countries sexual crimes, such as rape, fornication, adultery, incest, sodomy, and bestiality carry the death penalty, as do religious crimes such as hudud, zina, and qisas crimes, such as apostasy elaborations of tribal arbitration of feuds included peace settlements often done in a religious context and compensation system. compensation was based on the principle of substitution which might include material  systems deriving from blood feuds may survive alongside more advanced legal systems or be given recognition by courts a further example comes from ancient greece, where the athenian legal system replacing customary oral law was first written down by draco in about 621 bc: the death penalty was applied for a particularly wide range of crimes, though solon later repealed dracos code and published new laws, retaining capital punishment only for intentional homicide, and only with victims family permission. the word draconian derives from dracos laws. the romans also used the death penalty for a wide range of offences.protagoras  4 executions in the year 730 and 58 executions in the year 736.the two most common forms of execution in the tang dynasty were strangulation and decapitation, which were the prescribed methods of execution for 144 and 89 offences respectively. strangulation was the prescribed sentence for lodging an accusation against ones parents or grandparents with a magistrate, scheming to kidnap a person and sell them into slavery, and opening a coffin while desecrating a tomb. decapitation was the method of execution prescribed for more serious crimes such as treason and sedition. despite the great discomfort involved, most of the tang chinese preferred strangulation to decapitation, as a result of the traditional tang chinese belief that the body is a gift from the parents and that it is, therefore, disrespectful to ones ancestors to die without returning ones body to the grave intact.some further forms of capital punishment were practised in the tang dynasty, of which the first two that follow at least were extralegal. the first of these was scourging to death with the thick rod which was common throughout the tang dynasty especially in cases of gross corruption. the second was truncation, in which the convicted person was cut in two at the waist with a fodder knife and then left to bleed to death. a further form of execution called ling chi in medieval and early modern europe, before the development of modern prison systems, the death penalty was also used as a generalized form of punishment for even minor offences. during the reign of henry viii of england, as many as 72,000 people are estimated to have been executed.in early modern europe, a massive moral panic regarding witchcraft swept across europe and later the european colonies in north america. during this period, there were widespread claims that malevolent satanic witches were operating as an organized threat to christendom. as a result, tens of thousands of women were prosecuted for witchcraft and executed through the witch trials of the early modern period despite the wide use of the death penalty, calls for reform were not unknown. the 12th century jewish legal scholar, moses maimonides, wrote, ""it is better and more satisfactory to acquit a thousand guilty persons than to put a single innocent man to death."" he argued that executing an accused criminal on anything less than absolute certainty would lead to a slippery slope of decreasing burdens of proof, until we would be convicting merely ""according to the judges caprice"". maimonidess concern was maintaining popular respect for law, and he saw errors of commission as much more threatening than errors of omission.the abbasid caliphs in baghdad, such as al-mutadid, were often cruel in their punishments.while during the middle ages the expiatory aspect of the death penalty was taken into account, this is no longer the case under the lumi00. these were mainly property offences, for example cutting down a cherry tree in an orchard. in 1820, there were 160, including crimes such as shoplifting, petty theft or stealing cattle. the severity of the so-called bloody code was often tempered by juries who refused to convict, or judges, in the case of petty theft, who arbitrarily set the value stolen at below the statutory level for a capital crime.in nazi germany there were three types of capital punishment; hanging, decapitation and death by shooting. also, modern military organisations employed capital punishment as a means of maintaining military discipline. in the past, cowardice, absence without leave, desertion, insubordination, shirking under enemy fire and disobeying orders were often crimes punishable by death  according to robert conquest, the leading expert on joseph stalins purges, more than one million soviet citizens were executed during the great purge of 1937017 two major countries, turkey and the philippines, saw their executives making moves to reinstate the death penalty.  in the same year, passage of the law in the philippines failed to obtain the senates approval.in 724 in japan, the death penalty was banned during the reign of emperor sh years.in england, a public statement of opposition was included in the twelve conclusions of the lollards, written in 1395. sir thomas mores utopia, published in 1516, debated the benefits of the death penalty in dialogue form, coming to no firm conclusion. more was himself executed for treason in 1535. more recent opposition to the death penalty stemmed from the book of the italian cesare beccaria dei delitti e delle pene in the post classical republic of poljica life was ensured as a basic right in its poljica statute of 1440. the roman republic banned capital punishment in 1849. venezuela followed suit and abolished the death penalty in 1863 and san marino did so in 1865. the last execution in san marino had taken place in 1468. in portugal, after legislative proposals in 1852 and 1863, the death penalty was abolished in 1867. the last execution of the death penalty in brazil was 1876, from there all the condemnations were commuted by the emperor pedro ii until its abolition for civil offences and military offences in peacetime in 1891. the penalty for crimes committed in peacetime was then reinstated and abolished again twice in the united states, michigan was the first state to ban the death penalty, on 18 may 1846. the death penalty was declared unconstitutional between 1972 and 1976 based on the furman v. georgia case, but the 1976 gregg v. georgia case once again permitted the death penalty under certain circumstances. further limitations were placed on the death penalty in atkins v. virginia most countries, including almost all first world nations, have abolished capital punishment either in law or in practice; notable exceptions are the united states, japan and taiwan. additionally, capital punishment is also carried out in china, india, and most islamic states. the united states is the only western country to still use the death penalty.since world war ii, there has been a trend toward abolishing the death penalty. 58 countries retain the death penalty in active use, 102 countries have abolished capital punishment altogether, six have done so for all offences except under special circumstances, and 32 more have abolished it in practice because they have not used it for at least 10 years and are believed to have a policy or established practice against carrying out executions.according to amnesty international, 23 countries are known to have performed executions in 2016. there are countries which do not publish information on the use of capital punishment, most significantly china and north korea. as per amnesty international, around 1,000 prisoners were executed in 2017.the use of the death penalty is becoming increasingly restrained in some retentionist countries including taiwan and singapore. indonesia carried out no executions between november 2008 and march 2013. singapore, japan and the united states are the only developed countries that are classified by amnesty international as retentionist  nearly all retentionist countries are situated in asia, africa and the caribbean. the only retentionist country in europe is belarus. the death penalty was overwhelmingly practised in poor and authoritarian states, which often employed the death penalty as a tool of political oppression. during the 1980s, the democratisation of latin america swelled the ranks of abolitionist countries.this was soon followed by the fall of communism in europe. many of the countries which restored democracy aspired to enter the eu. the eu and the council of europe both strictly require member states not to practise the death penalty  the last execution in a member state of the present-day council of europe took place in 1997 in ukraine. in contrast, the rapid industrialisation in asia has seen an increase in the number of developed countries which are also retentionist. in these countries, the death penalty retains strong public support, and the matter receives little attention from the government or the media; in china there is a small but significant and growing movement to abolish the death penalty altogether. this trend has been followed by some african and middle eastern countries where support for the death penalty remains high.some countries have resumed practising the death penalty after having previously suspended the practice for long periods. the united states suspended executions in 1972 but resumed them in 1976; there was no execution in india between 1995 and 2004; and sri lanka declared an end to its moratorium on the death penalty on 20 november 2004, although it has not yet performed any further executions. the philippines re-introduced the death penalty in 1993 after abolishing it in 1987, but again abolished it in 2006.the united states and japan are the only developed countries to have recently carried out executions. the u.s. federal government, the u.s. military, and 31 states have a valid death penalty statute, and over 1,400 executions have been carried in the united states since it reinstated the death penalty in 1976. japan has 112 inmates with finalized death sentences as of december6, 2019, after executing wei wei, a former student from china who was charged with robbing and killing a japanese family of four, including children aged 8 and 11, in 2003.the most recent country to abolish the death penalty was burkina faso in june 2018.the public opinion on the death penalty varies considerably by country and by the crime in question. countries where a majority of people are against execution include norway, where only 25% are in favour. most french, finns, and italians also oppose the death penalty. a 2016 gallup poll shows that 60% of americans support the death penalty, down from 64% in 2010, 65% in 2006, and 68% in 2001.the support and sentencing of capital punishment has been growing in india in the 2010s due to anger over several recent brutal cases of rape, even though actual executions are comparatively rare. while support for the death penalty for murder is still high in china, executions have dropped precipitously, with 3,000 executed in 2012 versus 12,000 in 2002. a poll in south africa, where capital punishment is abolished, found that 76% of millennial south africans support re-introduction of the death penalty due to increasing incidents of rape and murder.a 2017 poll found younger mexicans are more likely to support capital punishment than older ones. 57% of brazilians support the death penalty. the age group that shows the greatest support for execution of those condemned is the 25 to 34-year-old category, in which 61% say they are in favor.the death penalty for juvenile offenders  china, pakistan, the united states, yemen and saudi arabia have since raised the minimum age to 18. amnesty international has recorded 61 verified executions since then, in several countries, of both juveniles and adults who had been convicted of committing their offences as juveniles. the prc does not allow for the execution of those under 18, but child executions have reportedly taken place.one of the youngest children ever to be executed was the infant son of perotine massey on or around 18 july 1556. his mother was one of the guernsey martyrs who was executed for heresy, and his father had previously fled the island. at less than one day old, he was ordered to be burned by bailiff hellier gosselin, with the advice of priests nearby who said the boy should burn due to having inherited moral stain from his mother, who had given birth during her execution.starting in 1642 within the then british american colonies until present day, an estimated 365 juvenile offenders were executed by the british colonial authorities and subsequently by state authorities and the federal government of the united states. the united states supreme court abolished capital punishment for offenders under the age of 16 in thompson v. oklahoma  capital punishment was cancelled by the electorate of bavaria in 1751 for children under the age of 11 and by the kingdom of bavaria in 1813 for children and youth under 16 years. in prussia, the exemption was extended to youth under the age of 16 in 1851. for the first time, all juveniles were excluded for the death penalty by the north german confederation in 1871, which was continued by the german empire in 1872. in nazi germany, capital punishment was reinstated for juveniles between 16 and 17 years in 1939. this was broadened to children and youth from age 12 to 17 in 1943. the death penalty for juveniles was abolished by west germany, also generally, in 1949 and by east germany in 1952.in the hereditary lands, austrian silesia, bohemia and moravia within the habsburg monarchy, capital punishment for children under the age of 11 was no longer foreseen by 1770. the death penalty was, also for juveniles, nearly abolished in 1787 except for emergency or military law, which is unclear in regard of those. it was reintroduced for juveniles above 14 years by 1803, and was raised by general criminal law to 20 years in 1852 and this exemption and the alike one of military law in 1855, which may have been up to 14 years in wartime, were also introduced into all of the austrian empire.in the helvetic republic, the death penalty for children and youth under the age of 16 was abolished in 1799 yet the country was already dissolved in 1803 whereas the law could remain in force if it was not replaced on cantonal level. in the canton of bern, all juveniles were exempted from the death penalty at least in 1866. in fribourg, capital punishment was generally, including for juveniles, abolished by 1849. in ticino, it was abolished for youth and young adults under the age of 20 in 1816. in zurich, the exclusion from the death penalty was extended for juveniles and young adults up to 19 years of age by 1835. in 1942, the death penalty was almost deleted in criminal law, as well for juveniles, but since 1928 persisted in military law during wartime for youth above 14 years. if no earlier change was made in the given subject, by 1979 juveniles could no longer be subject to the death penalty in military law during wartime.between 2005 and may 2008, iran, pakistan, saudi arabia, sudan and yemen were reported to have executed child offenders, the largest number occurring in iran.during hassan rouhanis current tenure as president of iran since 2013, at least 3,602 death sentences have been carried out. this includes the executions of 34 juvenile offenders.the united nations convention on the rights of the child, which forbids capital punishment for juveniles under article 37 the un sub-commission on the promotion and protection of human rights maintains that the death penalty for juveniles has become contrary to a jus cogens of customary international law. a majority of countries are also party to the u.n. international covenant on civil and political rights  based on the islamic law which now seems to have been revised, girls at the age of 9 and boys at 15 of lunar year  iran accounted for two-thirds of the global total of such executions, and currently has approximately 140 people considered as juveniles awaiting execution for crimes committed  the past executions of mahmoud asgari, ayaz marhoni and makwan moloudzadeh became the focus of irans child capital punishment policy and the judicial system that hands down such sentences.saudi arabia also executes criminals who were minors at the time of the offence. in 2013, saudi arabia was the center of an international controversy after it executed rizana nafeek, a sri lankan domestic worker, who was believed to have been 17 years old at the time of the crime. saudi arabia banned execution for minors, except for terrorism cases, in april 2020.japan has not executed juvenile criminals after august 1997, when they executed norio nagayama, a spree killer who had been convicted of shooting four people dead in the late 1960s. nagayamas case created the eponymously named nagayama standards, which take into account factors such as the number of victims, brutality and social impact of the crimes. the standards have been used in determining whether to apply the death sentence in murder cases. teruhiko seki, convicted of murdering four family members including a 4-year-old daughter and raping a 15-year-old daughter of a family in 1992, became the second inmate to be hanged for a crime committed as a minor in the first such execution in 20 years after nagayama on 19 december 2017. takayuki otsuki, who was convicted of raping and strangling a 23-year-old woman and subsequently strangling her 11-month-old daughter to death on 14 april 1999, when he was 18, is another inmate sentenced to death, and his request for retrial has been rejected by the supreme court of japan.there is evidence that child executions are taking place in the parts of somalia controlled by the islamic courts union  that it plans to ratify the convention on the rights of the child. this move was lauded by unicef as a welcome attempt to secure childrens rights in the country.the following methods of execution were used by various countries in 2020:a public execution is a form of capital punishment which ""members of the general public may voluntarily attend"". this definition excludes the presence of a small number of witnesses randomly selected to assure executive accountability. while today the great majority of the world considers public executions to be distasteful and most countries have outlawed the practice, throughout much of history executions were performed publicly as a means for the state to demonstrate ""its power before those who fell under its jurisdiction be they criminals, enemies, or political opponents"". additionally, it afforded the public a chance to witness ""what was considered a great spectacle"".social historians note that beginning in the 20th century in the u.s. and western europe death in general became increasingly shielded from public view, occurring more and more behind the closed doors of the hospital. executions were likewise moved behind the walls of the penitentiary. the last formal public executions occurred in 1868 in britain, in 1936 in the u.s. and in 1939 in france.according to amnesty international, in 2012, ""public executions were known to have been carried out in iran, north korea, saudi arabia and somalia"". there have been reports of public executions carried out by state and non-state actors in hamas-controlled gaza, syria, iraq, afghanistan, and yemen. executions which can be classified as public were also carried out in the u.s. states of florida and utah as of 1992.crimes against humanity such as genocide are usually punishable by death in countries retaining capital punishment. death sentences for such crimes were handed down and carried out during the nuremberg trials in 1946 and the tokyo trials in 1948, but the current international criminal court does not use capital punishment. the maximum penalty available to the international criminal court is life imprisonment.intentional homicide is punishable by death in most countries retaining capital punishment, but generally provided it involves an aggravating factor required by statute or judicial precedents. some countries like singapore and malaysia made the death penalty mandatory for murder, though singapore later changed its laws since 2013 to reserve the mandatory death sentence for intentional murder while providing an alternative sentence of life imprisonment for murder with no intention to cause death.many countries provide the death penalty for drug trafficking, drug dealing, drug possession and related offences, mostly in asia and some african countries. among countries who regularly execute drug offenders are china, indonesia, saudi arabia, iran, vietnam, malaysia, and singapore.other crimes that are punishable by death in some countries include:capital punishment is controversial. death penalty opponents regard the death penalty as inhumane and criticize it for its irreversibility. they argue also that capital punishment lacks deterrent effect, discriminates against minorities and the poor, and that it encourages a ""culture of violence"". there are many organizations worldwide, such as amnesty international, and country-specific, such as the american civil liberties union advocates of the death penalty argue that it deters crime, is a good tool for police and prosecutors in plea bargaining, makes sure that convicted criminals do not offend again, and that it ensures justice for crimes such as homicide, where other penalties will not inflict the desired retribution demanded by the crime itself. capital punishment for non-lethal crimes is usually considerably more controversial, and abolished in many of the countries that retain it.supporters of the death penalty argued that death penalty is morally justified when applied in murder especially with aggravating elements such as for murder of police officers, child murder, torture murder, multiple homicide and mass killing such as terrorism, massacre and genocide. this argument is strongly defended by new york law schools professor robert blecker, who says that the punishment must be painful in proportion to the crime. eighteenth-century philosopher immanuel kant defended a more extreme position, according to which every murderer deserves to die on the grounds that loss of life is incomparable to any penalty that allows them to remain alive, including life imprisonment.some abolitionists argue that retribution is simply revenge and cannot be condoned. others while accepting retribution as an element of criminal justice nonetheless argue that life without parole is a sufficient substitute. it is also argued that the punishing of a killing with another death is a relatively unique punishment for a violent act, because in general violent crimes are not punished by subjecting the perpetrator to a similar act abolitionists believe capital punishment is the worst violation of human rights, because the right to life is the most important, and capital punishment violates it without necessity and inflicts to the condemned a psychological torture. human rights activists oppose the death penalty, calling it ""cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment"". amnesty international considers it to be ""the ultimate irreversible denial of human rights"". albert camus wrote in a 1956 book called reflections on the guillotine, resistance, rebellion & death:an execution is not simply death. it is just as different from the privation of life as a concentration camp is from prison.  for there to be an equivalency, the death penalty would have to punish a criminal who had warned his victim of the date at which he would inflict a horrible death on him and who, from that moment onward, had confined him at his mercy for months. such a monster is not encountered in private life.in the classic doctrine of natural rights as expounded by for instance locke and blackstone, on the other hand, it is an important idea that the right to life can be forfeited, as most other rights can be given due process is observed, such as the right to property001 indicated that at least 34 of the 749 executions, or 4.5%, involved ""unanticipated problems or delays that caused, at least arguably, unnecessary agony for the prisoner or that reflect gross incompetence of the executioner"". the rate of these ""botched executions"" remained steady over the period of the study. a separate study published in the lancet in 2005 found that in 43% of cases of lethal injection, the blood level of hypnotics was insufficient to guarantee unconsciousness. however, the u.s. supreme court ruled in 2008  in bucklew v. precythe, the majority verdict - written by judge neil gorsuch - further affirmed this principle, stating that while the ban on cruel and unusual punishment affirmatively bans penalties that deliberately inflict pain and degradation, it does in no sense limit the possible infliction of pain in the execution of a capital verdict.it is frequently argued that capital punishment leads to miscarriage of justice through the wrongful execution of innocent persons. many people have been proclaimed innocent victims of the death penalty.some have claimed that as many as 39 executions have been carried out in the face of compelling evidence of innocence or serious doubt about guilt in the us from 1992 through 2004. newly available dna evidence prevented the pending execution of more than 15 death row inmates during the same period in the us, but dna evidence is only available in a fraction of capital cases. as of 2017, 159 prisoners on death row have been exonerated by dna or other evidence, which is seen as an indication that innocent prisoners have almost certainly been executed. the national coalition toabolish the death penalty claims that between 1976 and 2015, 1,414 prisoners in the united states have been executed while 156 sentenced to death have had their death sentences vacated, indicating that more than one in ten death row inmates were wrongly sentenced. it is impossible to assess how many have been wrongly executed, since courts do not generally investigate the innocence of a dead defendant, and defense attorneys tend to concentrate their efforts on clients whose lives can still be saved; however, there is strong evidence of innocence in many cases.improper procedure may also result in unfair executions. for example, amnesty international argues that in singapore ""the misuse of drugs act contains a series of presumptions which shift the burden of proof from the prosecution to the accused. this conflicts with the universally guaranteed right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty"". singapores misuse of drugs act presumes one is guilty of possession of drugs if, as examples, one is found to be present or escaping from a location ""proved or presumed to be used for the purpose of smoking or administering a controlled drug"", if one is in possession of a key to a premises where drugs are present, if one is in the company of another person found to be in possession of illegal drugs, or if one tests positive after being given a mandatory urine drug screening. urine drug screenings can be given at the discretion of police, without requiring a search warrant. the onus is on the accused in all of the above situations to prove that they were not in possession of or consumed illegal drugs.some prisoners have volunteered or attempted to expedite capital punishment, often by waiving all appeals. prisoners have made requests or committed further crimes in prison as well. in the united states, execution volunteers constitute approximately 11% of prisoners on death row. volunteers often bypass legal procedures which are designed to designate the death penalty for the ""worst of the worst"" offenders. opponents of execution volunteering cited the prevalence of mental illness among volunteers comparing it to suicide. execution volunteers have received considerably less attention and effort at legal reform than those who were exonerated after execution.opponents of the death penalty argue that this punishment is being used more often against perpetrators from racial and ethnic minorities and from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, than against those criminals who come from a privileged background; and that the background of the victim also influences the outcome. researchers have shown that white americans are more likely to support the death penalty when told that it is mostly applied to african americans, and that more stereotypically black-looking or darkskinned defendants are more likely to be sentenced to death if the case involves a white victim.in alabama in 2019, a death row inmate named domineque ray was denied his imam in the room during his execution, instead only offered a christian chaplain. after filing a complaint, a federal court of appeals ruled 5019, two shiite men, ali hakim al-arab, 25, and ahmad al-malali, 24, were executed in bahrain, despite the protests from the united nations and rights group. amnesty international stated that the executions were being carried out on confessions of ""terrorism crimes"" that were obtained through torture.the united nations introduced a resolution during the general assemblys 62nd sessions in 2007 calling for a universal ban. the approval of a draft resolution by the assemblys third committee, which deals with human rights issues, voted 99 to 52, with 33 abstentions, in favour of the resolution on 15 november 2007 and was put to a vote in the assembly on 18 december.again in 2008, a large majority of states from all regions adopted, on 20 november in the un general assembly a number of regional conventions prohibit the death penalty, most notably, the sixth protocol  and the united states. most relevant operative international treaties do not require its prohibition for cases of serious crime, most notably, the international covenant on civil and political rights. this instead has, in common with several other treaties, an optional protocol prohibiting capital punishment and promoting its wider abolition.several international organizations have made the abolition of the death penalty latvia abolished de jure the death penalty for war crimes in 2012, becoming the last eu member to do so.the protocol no.13 calls for the abolition of the death penalty in all circumstances the protocol no.6 which prohibits the death penalty during peacetime has been ratified by all members of the european council, except russia  and the protocol to the american convention on human rights to abolish the death penalty in turkey, over 500 people were sentenced to death after the 1980 turkish coup d5 october 1984. then there was a de facto moratorium on the death penalty in turkey.    as a move towards eu membership, turkey made some legal changes. the death penalty was removed from peacetime law by the national assembly in august 2002, and in may 2004 turkey amended its constitution in order to remove capital punishment in all circumstances. it ratified protocol no. 13 to the european convention on human rights in february 2006. as a result, europe is a continent free of the death penalty in practice, all states but russia, which has entered a moratorium, having ratified the sixth protocol to the european convention on human rights, with the sole exception of belarus, which is not a member of the council of europe. the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe has been lobbying for council of europe observer states who practise the death penalty, the u.s. and japan, to abolish it or lose their observer status. in addition to banning capital punishment for eu member states, the eu has also banned detainee transfers in cases where the receiving party may seek the death penalty.sub-saharan african countries that have recently abolished the death penalty include burundi, which abolished the death penalty for all crimes in 2009, and gabon which did the same in 2010. on 5 july 2012, benin became part of the second optional protocol to the international covenant on civil and political rights the newly created south sudan is among the 111 un member states that supported the resolution passed by the united nations general assembly that called for the removal of the death penalty, therefore affirming its opposition to the practice. south sudan, however, has not yet abolished the death penalty and stated that it must first amend its constitution, and until that happens it will continue to use the death penalty.among non-governmental organizations bibliography",1,0
"dance is a performing art form consisting of purposefully selected sequences of human movement. this movement has aesthetic and symbolic value, and is acknowledged as dance by performers and observers within a particular culture. dance can be categorized and described by its choreography, by its repertoire of movements, or by its historical period or place of origin.an important distinction is to be drawn between the contexts of theatrical and participatory dance, although these two categories are not always completely separate; both may have special functions, whether social, ceremonial, competitive, erotic, martial, or sacred/liturgical. other forms of human movement are sometimes said to have a dance-like quality, including martial arts, gymnastics, cheerleading, figure skating, synchronised swimming, marching bands, and many other forms of athletics.theatrical dance, also called performance or concert dance, is intended primarily as a spectacle, usually a performance upon a stage by virtuoso dancers. it often tells a story, perhaps using mime, costume and scenery, or else it may simply interpret the musical accompaniment, which is often specially composed. examples are western ballet and modern dance, classical indian dance and chinese and japanese song and dance dramas. most classical forms are centred upon dance alone, but performance dance may also appear in opera and other forms of musical theatre.participatory dance, on the other hand, whether it be a folk dance, a social dance, a group dance such as a line, circle, chain or square dance, or a partner dance such as is common in western western ballroom dancing, is undertaken primarily for a common purpose, such as social interaction or exercise, of participants rather than onlookers. such dance seldom has any narrative. a group dance and a corps de ballet, a social partner dance and a pas de deux, differ profoundly. even a solo dance may be undertaken solely for the satisfaction of the dancer. participatory dancers often all employ the same movements and steps but, for example, in the rave culture of electronic dance music, vast crowds may engage in free dance, uncoordinated with those around them. on the other hand, some cultures lay down strict rules as to the particular dances in which, for example, men, women and children may or must participate.archeological evidence for early dance includes 9,000-year-old paintings in india at the rock shelters of bhimbetka, and egyptian tomb paintings depicting dancing figures, dated c. 3300 bc. it has been proposed that before the invention of written languages, dance was an important part of the oral and performance methods of passing stories down from one generation to the next. the use of dance in ecstatic trance states and healing rituals references to dance can be found in very early recorded history; greek dance  the bible and talmud refer to many events related to dance, and contain over 30 different dance terms. in chinese pottery as early as the neolithic period, groups of people are depicted dancing in a line holding hands, and the earliest chinese word for ""dance"" is found written in the oracle bones. dance is further described in the l and 3 part inventions, adams violin concerto and andantino. similarly, poems are often structured and named after dances or musical works, while dance and music have both drawn their conception of ""measure"" or ""metre"" from poetry.shawn quotes with approval the statement of dalcroze that, while the art of musical rhythm consists in differentiating and combining time durations, pauses and accents ""according to physiological law"", that of ""plastic rhythm"" the early-20th-century american dancer helen moller stated simply that ""it is rhythm and form more than harmony and color which, from the beginning, has bound music, poetry and dancing together in a union that is indissoluble.""concert dance, like opera, generally depends for its large-scale form upon a narrative dramatic structure. the movements and gestures of the choreography are primarily intended to mime the personality and aims of the characters and their part in the plot. such theatrical requirements tend towards longer, freer movements than those usual in non-narrative dance styles. on the other hand, the ballet blanc, developed in the 19th century, allows interludes of rhythmic dance that developed into entirely ""plotless"" ballets in the 20th century and that allowed fast, rhythmic dance-steps such as those of the petit allegro. a well-known example is the cygnets dance in act two of swan lake.the ballet developed out of courtly dramatic productions of 16th- and 17th-century france and italy and for some time dancers performed dances developed from those familiar from the musical suite, all of which were defined by definite rhythms closely identified with each dance. these appeared as character dances in the era of romantic nationalism.ballet reached widespread vogue in the romantic era, accompanied by a larger orchestra and grander musical conceptions that did not lend themselves easily to rhythmic clarity and by dance that emphasised dramatic mime. a broader concept of rhythm was needed, that which rudolf laban terms the ""rhythm and shape"" of movement that communicates character, emotion and intention, while only certain scenes required the exact synchronisation of step and music essential to other dance styles, so that, to laban, modern europeans seemed totally unable to grasp the meaning of ""primitive rhythmic movements"", a situation that began to change in the 20th century with such productions as igor stravinskys the rite of spring with its new rhythmic language evoking primal feelings of a primitive past.indian classical dance styles, like ballet, are often in dramatic form, so that there is a similar complementarity between narrative expression and ""pure"" dance. in this case, however, the two are separately defined, though not always separately performed. the rhythmic elements, which are abstract and technical, are known as nritta. both this and expressive dance  somewhat similarly, noh distinguishes between geki noh, based around the advancement of plot and the narration of action, and fury0th century concert dance brought an explosion of innovation in dance style characterized by an exploration of freer technique. early pioneers of what became known as modern dance include loie fuller, isadora duncan, mary wigman and ruth st. denis. the relationship of music to dance serves as the basis for eurhythmics, devised by emile jaques-dalcroze, which was influential to the development of modern dance and modern ballet through artists such as marie rambert. eurythmy, developed by rudolf steiner and marie steiner-von sivers, combines formal elements reminiscent of traditional dance with the new freer style, and introduced a complex new vocabulary to dance. in the 1920s, important founders of the new style such as martha graham and doris humphrey began their work. since this time, a wide variety of dance styles have been developed; see modern dance.african american dance developed in everyday spaces, rather than in dance studios, schools or companies. tap dance, disco, jazz dance, swing dance, hip hop dance, the lindy hop with its relationship to rock and roll music and rock and roll dance have had a global influence. dance styles fusing classical ballet technique with african-american dance have also appeared in the 21st century, including hiplet.dance is central to latin american social life and culture. brazilian samba, argentinian tango, and cuban salsa are internationally popular partner dances, and other national dances0th century dance that would go on to influence swing, jive, and jazz dancelatin ballroom dancers perform the tangogumboot dance evolved from the stomping signals used as coded communication between labourers in south african minesharlequin and columbina from the mime theater in copenhagen, denmarka hip-hop dancer demonstrates poppingerotic dance 017kebagh dance from pagar alam, indonesia",1,0

their video to be seen, such as a specific physical location. douyin also has its store, in which users can tag and advertise their products, and users can request to work with an influencer for brand

videos and other content being shared by the apps users through http puts the users data privacy at risk.in january 2020, check point research discovered a security flaw in tiktok which could have allowed hackers access to user accounts using sms. in february, reddit ceo steve huffman criticised the app, calling it ""spyware,"" and stating ""i look at that app as so fundamentally parasitic, that its always listening, the fingerprinting technology they use is truly terrifying, and i could not bring myself to install an app like that on my phone."" responding to huffmans comments, tiktok stated ""these are baseless accusations made without a shred of evidence."" wells fargo banned the app from its devices due to privacy and security concerns.in may 2020, the dutch data protection authority announced an investigation into tiktok in relation to privacy protections for children. in june 2020, the european data protection board announced that it would assemble a task force to examine tiktoks user privacy and security practices.in august 2020, the wall street journal reported that tiktok tracked android user data, including mac addresses and imeis, with a tactic in violation of googles policies. the report sparked calls in the u.s. senate for the federal trade commission to launch an investigation.on 27 february 2019, the united states federal trade commission  bytedance responded by adding a kids-only mode to tiktok which blocks the upload of videos, the building of user profiles, direct messaging, and commenting on others videos, while still allowing the viewing and recording of content. in may 2020, an advocacy group filed a complaint with the ftc saying that tiktok had violated the terms of the february 2019 consent decree, which sparked subsequent congressional calls for a renewed ftc investigation. in july 2020, it was reported that the ftc and the united states department of justice had initiated investigations.in february 2019, the united kingdoms information commissioners office launched an investigation of tiktok following the fine bytedance received from the united states federal trade commission as with other platforms, journalists in several countries have raised privacy concerns about the app, because it is popular with children and has the potential to be used by sexual predators.several users have reported endemic cyberbullying on tiktok, including racism and ableism. in december 2019, following a report by german digital rights group netzpolitik.org, tiktok admitted that it had suppressed videos by disabled users as well as lgbtq+ users in a purported effort to limit cyberbullying. tiktoks moderators were also told to suppress users with ""abnormal body shape"", ""ugly facial looks"", ""too many

"capital punishment, also known as the death penalty, is a government-sanctioned practice whereby a person is put to death by the state as a punishment for a crime. the sentence ordering that someone be punished in such a manner is referred to as a death sentence, whereas the act of carrying out such a sentence is known as an execution. a prisoner who has been sentenced to death and is awaiting execution is referred to as condemned, and is said in some countries to be on ""death row"". crimes that are punishable by death are known as capital crimes, capital offences or capital felonies, and vary depending on the jurisdiction, but commonly include serious offences such as murder, mass murder, aggravated cases of rape, child rape, child sexual abuse, terrorism, treason, espionage, sedition, offences against the state  but executions can done by various other methods, such as hanging, shooting, lethal injection, stoning, electrocution and gassing.fifty-six countries retain capital punishment, 106 countries have completely abolished it de jure for all crimes, eight have abolished it for ordinary crimes  although most nations have abolished capital punishment, over 60% of the worlds population live in countries where the death penalty is retained, such as china, india, the united states, indonesia, pakistan, bangladesh, nigeria, ethiopia, egypt, saudi arabia, iran, and among almost all islamic countries, as well as in japan, south korea, taiwan, and sri lanka. china is believed to execute more people than all other countries combined.capital punishment is a matter of active controversy in several countries and states, and positions can vary within a single political ideology or cultural region. in the european union  the council of europe, which has 47 member states, has sought to abolish the use of the death penalty by its members absolutely, through protocol 13 of the european convention on human rights. however, this only affects those member states which have signed and ratified it, and they do not include armenia, russia, and azerbaijan. the united nations general assembly has adopted, throughout the years from 2007 to 2018, seven non-binding resolutions calling for a global moratorium on executions, with a view to eventual abolition.execution of criminals and dissidents has been used by nearly all societies since the beginning of civilizations on earth. until the nineteenth century, without developed prison systems, there was frequently no workable alternative to ensure deterrence and incapacitation of criminals. in pre-modern times the executions themselves often involved torture with cruel and painful methods, such as the breaking wheel, keelhauling, sawing, hanging, drawing, and quartering, brazen bull, burning at the stake, flaying, slow slicing, boiling alive, impalement, mazzatello, blowing from a gun, schwedentrunk, blood eagle, and scaphism.the use of formal execution extends to the beginning of recorded history. most historical records and various primitive tribal practices indicate that the death penalty was a part of their justice system. communal punishments for wrongdoing generally included blood money compensation by the wrongdoer, corporal punishment, shunning, banishment and execution. in tribal societies, compensation and shunning were often considered enough as a form of justice. the response to crimes committed by neighbouring tribes, clans or communities included a formal apology, compensation, blood feuds, and tribal warfare.a blood feud or vendetta occurs when arbitration between families or tribes fails or an arbitration system is non-existent. this form of justice was common before the emergence of an arbitration system based on state or organized religion. it may result from crime, land disputes or a code of honour. ""acts of retaliation underscore the ability of the social collective to defend itself and demonstrate to enemies in most countries that practise capital punishment, it is now reserved for murder, terrorism, war crimes, espionage, treason, or as part of military justice.  in some countries sexual crimes, such as rape, fornication, adultery, incest, sodomy, and bestiality carry the death penalty, as do religious crimes such as hudud, zina, and qisas crimes, such as apostasy elaborations of tribal arbitration of feuds included peace settlements often done in a religious context and compensation system. compensation was based on the principle of substitution which might include material  systems deriving from blood feuds may survive alongside more advanced legal systems or be given recognition by courts a further example comes from ancient greece, where the athenian legal system replacing customary oral law was first written down by draco in about 621 bc: the death penalty was applied for a particularly wide range of crimes, though solon later repealed dracos code and published new laws, retaining capital punishment only for intentional homicide, and only with victims family permission. the word draconian derives from dracos laws. the romans also used the death penalty for a wide range of offences.protagoras  4 executions in the year 730 and 58 executions in the year 736.the two most common forms of execution in the tang dynasty were strangulation and decapitation, which were the prescribed methods of execution for 144 and 89 offences respectively. strangulation was the prescribed sentence for lodging an accusation against ones parents or grandparents with a magistrate, scheming to kidnap a person and sell them into slavery, and opening a coffin while desecrating a tomb. decapitation was the method of execution prescribed for more serious crimes such as treason and sedition. despite the great discomfort involved, most of the tang chinese preferred strangulation to decapitation, as a result of the traditional tang chinese belief that the body is a gift from the parents and that it is, therefore, disrespectful to ones ancestors to die without returning ones body to the grave intact.some further forms of capital punishment were practised in the tang dynasty, of which the first two that follow at least were extralegal. the first of these was scourging to death with the thick rod which was common throughout the tang dynasty especially in cases of gross corruption. the second was truncation, in which the convicted person was cut in two at the waist with a fodder knife and then left to bleed to death. a further form of execution called ling chi in medieval and early modern europe, before the development of modern prison systems, the death penalty was also used as a generalized form of punishment for even minor offences. during the reign of henry viii of england, as many as 72,000 people are estimated to have been executed.in early modern europe, a massive moral panic regarding witchcraft swept across europe and later the european colonies in north america. during this period, there were widespread claims that malevolent satanic witches were operating as an organized threat to christendom. as a result, tens of thousands of women were prosecuted for witchcraft and executed through the witch trials of the early modern period despite the wide use of the death penalty, calls for reform were not unknown. the 12th century jewish legal scholar, moses maimonides, wrote, ""it is better and more satisfactory to acquit a thousand guilty persons than to put a single innocent man to death."" he argued that executing an accused criminal on anything less than absolute certainty would lead to a slippery slope of decreasing burdens of proof, until we would be convicting merely ""according to the judges caprice"". maimonidess concern was maintaining popular respect for law, and he saw errors of commission as much more threatening than errors of omission.the abbasid caliphs in baghdad, such as al-mutadid, were often cruel in their punishments.while during the middle ages the expiatory aspect of the death penalty was taken into account, this is no longer the case under the lumi00. these were mainly property offences, for example cutting down a cherry tree in an orchard. in 1820, there were 160, including crimes such as shoplifting, petty theft or stealing cattle. the severity of the so-called bloody code was often tempered by juries who refused to convict, or judges, in the case of petty theft, who arbitrarily set the value stolen at below the statutory level for a capital crime.in nazi germany there were three types of capital punishment; hanging, decapitation and death by shooting. also, modern military organisations employed capital punishment as a means of maintaining military discipline. in the past, cowardice, absence without leave, desertion, insubordination, shirking under enemy fire and disobeying orders were often crimes punishable by death  according to robert conquest, the leading expert on joseph stalins purges, more than one million soviet citizens were executed during the great purge of 1937017 two major countries, turkey and the philippines, saw their executives making moves to reinstate the death penalty.  in the same year, passage of the law in the philippines failed to obtain the senates approval.in 724 in japan, the death penalty was banned during the reign of emperor sh years.in england, a public statement of opposition was included in the twelve conclusions of the lollards, written in 1395. sir thomas mores utopia, published in 1516, debated the benefits of the death penalty in dialogue form, coming to no firm conclusion. more was himself executed for treason in 1535. more recent opposition to the death penalty stemmed from the book of the italian cesare beccaria dei delitti e delle pene in the post classical republic of poljica life was ensured as a basic right in its poljica statute of 1440. the roman republic banned capital punishment in 1849. venezuela followed suit and abolished the death penalty in 1863 and san marino did so in 1865. the last execution in san marino had taken place in 1468. in portugal, after legislative proposals in 1852 and 1863, the death penalty was abolished in 1867. the last execution of the death penalty in brazil was 1876, from there all the condemnations were commuted by the emperor pedro ii until its abolition for civil offences and military offences in peacetime in 1891. the penalty for crimes committed in peacetime was then reinstated and abolished again twice in the united states, michigan was the first state to ban the death penalty, on 18 may 1846. the death penalty was declared unconstitutional between 1972 and 1976 based on the furman v. georgia case, but the 1976 gregg v. georgia case once again permitted the death penalty under certain circumstances. further limitations were placed on the death penalty in atkins v. virginia most countries, including almost all first world nations, have abolished capital punishment either in law or in practice; notable exceptions are the united states, japan and taiwan. additionally, capital punishment is also carried out in china, india, and most islamic states. the united states is the only western country to still use the death penalty.since world war ii, there has been a trend toward abolishing the death penalty. 58 countries retain the death penalty in active use, 102 countries have abolished capital punishment altogether, six have done so for all offences except under special circumstances, and 32 more have abolished it in practice because they have not used it for at least 10 years and are believed to have a policy or established practice against carrying out executions.according to amnesty international, 23 countries are known to have performed executions in 2016. there are countries which do not publish information on the use of capital punishment, most significantly china and north korea. as per amnesty international, around 1,000 prisoners were executed in 2017.the use of the death penalty is becoming increasingly restrained in some retentionist countries including taiwan and singapore. indonesia carried out no executions between november 2008 and march 2013. singapore, japan and the united states are the only developed countries that are classified by amnesty international as retentionist  nearly all retentionist countries are situated in asia, africa and the caribbean. the only retentionist country in europe is belarus. the death penalty was overwhelmingly practised in poor and authoritarian states, which often employed the death penalty as a tool of political oppression. during the 1980s, the democratisation of latin america swelled the ranks of abolitionist countries.this was soon followed by the fall of communism in europe. many of the countries which restored democracy aspired to enter the eu. the eu and the council of europe both strictly require member states not to practise the death penalty  the last execution in a member state of the present-day council of europe took place in 1997 in ukraine. in contrast, the rapid industrialisation in asia has seen an increase in the number of developed countries which are also retentionist. in these countries, the death penalty retains strong public support, and the matter receives little attention from the government or the media; in china there is a small but significant and growing movement to abolish the death penalty altogether. this trend has been followed by some african and middle eastern countries where support for the death penalty remains high.some countries have resumed practising the death penalty after having previously suspended the practice for long periods. the united states suspended executions in 1972 but resumed them in 1976; there was no execution in india between 1995 and 2004; and sri lanka declared an end to its moratorium on the death penalty on 20 november 2004, although it has not yet performed any further executions. the philippines re-introduced the death penalty in 1993 after abolishing it in 1987, but again abolished it in 2006.the united states and japan are the only developed countries to have recently carried out executions. the u.s. federal government, the u.s. military, and 31 states have a valid death penalty statute, and over 1,400 executions have been carried in the united states since it reinstated the death penalty in 1976. japan has 112 inmates with finalized death sentences as of december6, 2019, after executing wei wei, a former student from china who was charged with robbing and killing a japanese family of four, including children aged 8 and 11, in 2003.the most recent country to abolish the death penalty was burkina faso in june 2018.the public opinion on the death penalty varies considerably by country and by the crime in question. countries where a majority of people are against execution include norway, where only 25% are in favour. most french, finns, and italians also oppose the death penalty. a 2016 gallup poll shows that 60% of americans support the death penalty, down from 64% in 2010, 65% in 2006, and 68% in 2001.the support and sentencing of capital punishment has been growing in india in the 2010s due to anger over several recent brutal cases of rape, even though actual executions are comparatively rare. while support for the death penalty for murder is still high in china, executions have dropped precipitously, with 3,000 executed in 2012 versus 12,000 in 2002. a poll in south africa, where capital punishment is abolished, found that 76% of millennial south africans support re-introduction of the death penalty due to increasing incidents of rape and murder.a 2017 poll found younger mexicans are more likely to support capital punishment than older ones. 57% of brazilians support the death penalty. the age group that shows the greatest support for execution of those condemned is the 25 to 34-year-old category, in which 61% say they are in favor.the death penalty for juvenile offenders  china, pakistan, the united states, yemen and saudi arabia have since raised the minimum age to 18. amnesty international has recorded 61 verified executions since then, in several countries, of both juveniles and adults who had been convicted of committing their offences as juveniles. the prc does not allow for the execution of those under 18, but child executions have reportedly taken place.one of the youngest children ever to be executed was the infant son of perotine massey on or around 18 july 1556. his mother was one of the guernsey martyrs who was executed for heresy, and his father had previously fled the island. at less than one day old, he was ordered to be burned by bailiff hellier gosselin, with the advice of priests nearby who said the boy should burn due to having inherited moral stain from his mother, who had given birth during her execution.starting in 1642 within the then british american colonies until present day, an estimated 365 juvenile offenders were executed by the british colonial authorities and subsequently by state authorities and the federal government of the united states. the united states supreme court abolished capital punishment for offenders under the age of 16 in thompson v. oklahoma  capital punishment was cancelled by the electorate of bavaria in 1751 for children under the age of 11 and by the kingdom of bavaria in 1813 for children and youth under 16 years. in prussia, the exemption was extended to youth under the age of 16 in 1851. for the first time, all juveniles were excluded for the death penalty by the north german confederation in 1871, which was continued by the german empire in 1872. in nazi germany, capital punishment was reinstated for juveniles between 16 and 17 years in 1939. this was broadened to children and youth from age 12 to 17 in 1943. the death penalty for juveniles was abolished by west germany, also generally, in 1949 and by east germany in 1952.in the hereditary lands, austrian silesia, bohemia and moravia within the habsburg monarchy, capital punishment for children under the age of 11 was no longer foreseen by 1770. the death penalty was, also for juveniles, nearly abolished in 1787 except for emergency or military law, which is unclear in regard of those. it was reintroduced for juveniles above 14 years by 1803, and was raised by general criminal law to 20 years in 1852 and this exemption and the alike one of military law in 1855, which may have been up to 14 years in wartime, were also introduced into all of the austrian empire.in the helvetic republic, the death penalty for children and youth under the age of 16 was abolished in 1799 yet the country was already dissolved in 1803 whereas the law could remain in force if it was not replaced on cantonal level. in the canton of bern, all juveniles were exempted from the death penalty at least in 1866. in fribourg, capital punishment was generally, including for juveniles, abolished by 1849. in ticino, it was abolished for youth and young adults under the age of 20 in 1816. in zurich, the exclusion from the death penalty was extended for juveniles and young adults up to 19 years of age by 1835. in 1942, the death penalty was almost deleted in criminal law, as well for juveniles, but since 1928 persisted in military law during wartime for youth above 14 years. if no earlier change was made in the given subject, by 1979 juveniles could no longer be subject to the death penalty in military law during wartime.between 2005 and may 2008, iran, pakistan, saudi arabia, sudan and yemen were reported to have executed child offenders, the largest number occurring in iran.during hassan rouhanis current tenure as president of iran since 2013, at least 3,602 death sentences have been carried out. this includes the executions of 34 juvenile offenders.the united nations convention on the rights of the child, which forbids capital punishment for juveniles under article 37 the un sub-commission on the promotion and protection of human rights maintains that the death penalty for juveniles has become contrary to a jus cogens of customary international law. a majority of countries are also party to the u.n. international covenant on civil and political rights  based on the islamic law which now seems to have been revised, girls at the age of 9 and boys at 15 of lunar year  iran accounted for two-thirds of the global total of such executions, and currently has approximately 140 people considered as juveniles awaiting execution for crimes committed  the past executions of mahmoud asgari, ayaz marhoni and makwan moloudzadeh became the focus of irans child capital punishment policy and the judicial system that hands down such sentences.saudi arabia also executes criminals who were minors at the time of the offence. in 2013, saudi arabia was the center of an international controversy after it executed rizana nafeek, a sri lankan domestic worker, who was believed to have been 17 years old at the time of the crime. saudi arabia banned execution for minors, except for terrorism cases, in april 2020.japan has not executed juvenile criminals after august 1997, when they executed norio nagayama, a spree killer who had been convicted of shooting four people dead in the late 1960s. nagayamas case created the eponymously named nagayama standards, which take into account factors such as the number of victims, brutality and social impact of the crimes. the standards have been used in determining whether to apply the death sentence in murder cases. teruhiko seki, convicted of murdering four family members including a 4-year-old daughter and raping a 15-year-old daughter of a family in 1992, became the second inmate to be hanged for a crime committed as a minor in the first such execution in 20 years after nagayama on 19 december 2017. takayuki otsuki, who was convicted of raping and strangling a 23-year-old woman and subsequently strangling her 11-month-old daughter to death on 14 april 1999, when he was 18, is another inmate sentenced to death, and his request for retrial has been rejected by the supreme court of japan.there is evidence that child executions are taking place in the parts of somalia controlled by the islamic courts union  that it plans to ratify the convention on the rights of the child. this move was lauded by unicef as a welcome attempt to secure childrens rights in the country.the following methods of execution were used by various countries in 2020:a public execution is a form of capital punishment which ""members of the general public may voluntarily attend"". this definition excludes the presence of a small number of witnesses randomly selected to assure executive accountability. while today the great majority of the world considers public executions to be distasteful and most countries have outlawed the practice, throughout much of history executions were performed publicly as a means for the state to demonstrate ""its power before those who fell under its jurisdiction be they criminals, enemies, or political opponents"". additionally, it afforded the public a chance to witness ""what was considered a great spectacle"".social historians note that beginning in the 20th century in the u.s. and western europe death in general became increasingly shielded from public view, occurring more and more behind the closed doors of the hospital. executions were likewise moved behind the walls of the penitentiary. the last formal public executions occurred in 1868 in britain, in 1936 in the u.s. and in 1939 in france.according to amnesty international, in 2012, ""public executions were known to have been carried out in iran, north korea, saudi arabia and somalia"". there have been reports of public executions carried out by state and non-state actors in hamas-controlled gaza, syria, iraq, afghanistan, and yemen. executions which can be classified as public were also carried out in the u.s. states of florida and utah as of 1992.crimes against humanity such as genocide are usually punishable by death in countries retaining capital punishment. death sentences for such crimes were handed down and carried out during the nuremberg trials in 1946 and the tokyo trials in 1948, but the current international criminal court does not use capital punishment. the maximum penalty available to the international criminal court is life imprisonment.intentional homicide is punishable by death in most countries retaining capital punishment, but generally provided it involves an aggravating factor required by statute or judicial precedents. some countries like singapore and malaysia made the death penalty mandatory for murder, though singapore later changed its laws since 2013 to reserve the mandatory death sentence for intentional murder while providing an alternative sentence of life imprisonment for murder with no intention to cause death.many countries provide the death penalty for drug trafficking, drug dealing, drug possession and related offences, mostly in asia and some african countries. among countries who regularly execute drug offenders are china, indonesia, saudi arabia, iran, vietnam, malaysia, and singapore.other crimes that are punishable by death in some countries include:capital punishment is controversial. death penalty opponents regard the death penalty as inhumane and criticize it for its irreversibility. they argue also that capital punishment lacks deterrent effect, discriminates against minorities and the poor, and that it encourages a ""culture of violence"". there are many organizations worldwide, such as amnesty international, and country-specific, such as the american civil liberties union advocates of the death penalty argue that it deters crime, is a good tool for police and prosecutors in plea bargaining, makes sure that convicted criminals do not offend again, and that it ensures justice for crimes such as homicide, where other penalties will not inflict the desired retribution demanded by the crime itself. capital punishment for non-lethal crimes is usually considerably more controversial, and abolished in many of the countries that retain it.supporters of the death penalty argued that death penalty is morally justified when applied in murder especially with aggravating elements such as for murder of police officers, child murder, torture murder, multiple homicide and mass killing such as terrorism, massacre and genocide. this argument is strongly defended by new york law schools professor robert blecker, who says that the punishment must be painful in proportion to the crime. eighteenth-century philosopher immanuel kant defended a more extreme position, according to which every murderer deserves to die on the grounds that loss of life is incomparable to any penalty that allows them to remain alive, including life imprisonment.some abolitionists argue that retribution is simply revenge and cannot be condoned. others while accepting retribution as an element of criminal justice nonetheless argue that life without parole is a sufficient substitute. it is also argued that the punishing of a killing with another death is a relatively unique punishment for a violent act, because in general violent crimes are not punished by subjecting the perpetrator to a similar act abolitionists believe capital punishment is the worst violation of human rights, because the right to life is the most important, and capital punishment violates it without necessity and inflicts to the condemned a psychological torture. human rights activists oppose the death penalty, calling it ""cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment"". amnesty international considers it to be ""the ultimate irreversible denial of human rights"". albert camus wrote in a 1956 book called reflections on the guillotine, resistance, rebellion & death:an execution is not simply death. it is just as different from the privation of life as a concentration camp is from prison.  for there to be an equivalency, the death penalty would have to punish a criminal who had warned his victim of the date at which he would inflict a horrible death on him and who, from that moment onward, had confined him at his mercy for months. such a monster is not encountered in private life.in the classic doctrine of natural rights as expounded by for instance locke and blackstone, on the other hand, it is an important idea that the right to life can be forfeited, as most other rights can be given due process is observed, such as the right to property001 indicated that at least 34 of the 749 executions, or 4.5%, involved ""unanticipated problems or delays that caused, at least arguably, unnecessary agony for the prisoner or that reflect gross incompetence of the executioner"". the rate of these ""botched executions"" remained steady over the period of the study. a separate study published in the lancet in 2005 found that in 43% of cases of lethal injection, the blood level of hypnotics was insufficient to guarantee unconsciousness. however, the u.s. supreme court ruled in 2008  in bucklew v. precythe, the majority verdict - written by judge neil gorsuch - further affirmed this principle, stating that while the ban on cruel and unusual punishment affirmatively bans penalties that deliberately inflict pain and degradation, it does in no sense limit the possible infliction of pain in the execution of a capital verdict.it is frequently argued that capital punishment leads to miscarriage of justice through the wrongful execution of innocent persons. many people have been proclaimed innocent victims of the death penalty.some have claimed that as many as 39 executions have been carried out in the face of compelling evidence of innocence or serious doubt about guilt in the us from 1992 through 2004. newly available dna evidence prevented the pending execution of more than 15 death row inmates during the same period in the us, but dna evidence is only available in a fraction of capital cases. as of 2017, 159 prisoners on death row have been exonerated by dna or other evidence, which is seen as an indication that innocent prisoners have almost certainly been executed. the national coalition toabolish the death penalty claims that between 1976 and 2015, 1,414 prisoners in the united states have been executed while 156 sentenced to death have had their death sentences vacated, indicating that more than one in ten death row inmates were wrongly sentenced. it is impossible to assess how many have been wrongly executed, since courts do not generally investigate the innocence of a dead defendant, and defense attorneys tend to concentrate their efforts on clients whose lives can still be saved; however, there is strong evidence of innocence in many cases.improper procedure may also result in unfair executions. for example, amnesty international argues that in singapore ""the misuse of drugs act contains a series of presumptions which shift the burden of proof from the prosecution to the accused. this conflicts with the universally guaranteed right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty"". singapores misuse of drugs act presumes one is guilty of possession of drugs if, as examples, one is found to be present or escaping from a location ""proved or presumed to be used for the purpose of smoking or administering a controlled drug"", if one is in possession of a key to a premises where drugs are present, if one is in the company of another person found to be in possession of illegal drugs, or if one tests positive after being given a mandatory urine drug screening. urine drug screenings can be given at the discretion of police, without requiring a search warrant. the onus is on the accused in all of the above situations to prove that they were not in possession of or consumed illegal drugs.some prisoners have volunteered or attempted to expedite capital punishment, often by waiving all appeals. prisoners have made requests or committed further crimes in prison as well. in the united states, execution volunteers constitute approximately 11% of prisoners on death row. volunteers often bypass legal procedures which are designed to designate the death penalty for the ""worst of the worst"" offenders. opponents of execution volunteering cited the prevalence of mental illness among volunteers comparing it to suicide. execution volunteers have received considerably less attention and effort at legal reform than those who were exonerated after execution.opponents of the death penalty argue that this punishment is being used more often against perpetrators from racial and ethnic minorities and from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, than against those criminals who come from a privileged background; and that the background of the victim also influences the outcome. researchers have shown that white americans are more likely to support the death penalty when told that it is mostly applied to african americans, and that more stereotypically black-looking or darkskinned defendants are more likely to be sentenced to death if the case involves a white victim.in alabama in 2019, a death row inmate named domineque ray was denied his imam in the room during his execution, instead only offered a christian chaplain. after filing a complaint, a federal court of appeals ruled 5019, two shiite men, ali hakim al-arab, 25, and ahmad al-malali, 24, were executed in bahrain, despite the protests from the united nations and rights group. amnesty international stated that the executions were being carried out on confessions of ""terrorism crimes"" that were obtained through torture.the united nations introduced a resolution during the general assemblys 62nd sessions in 2007 calling for a universal ban. the approval of a draft resolution by the assemblys third committee, which deals with human rights issues, voted 99 to 52, with 33 abstentions, in favour of the resolution on 15 november 2007 and was put to a vote in the assembly on 18 december.again in 2008, a large majority of states from all regions adopted, on 20 november in the un general assembly a number of regional conventions prohibit the death penalty, most notably, the sixth protocol  and the united states. most relevant operative international treaties do not require its prohibition for cases of serious crime, most notably, the international covenant on civil and political rights. this instead has, in common with several other treaties, an optional protocol prohibiting capital punishment and promoting its wider abolition.several international organizations have made the abolition of the death penalty latvia abolished de jure the death penalty for war crimes in 2012, becoming the last eu member to do so.the protocol no.13 calls for the abolition of the death penalty in all circumstances the protocol no.6 which prohibits the death penalty during peacetime has been ratified by all members of the european council, except russia  and the protocol to the american convention on human rights to abolish the death penalty in turkey, over 500 people were sentenced to death after the 1980 turkish coup d5 october 1984. then there was a de facto moratorium on the death penalty in turkey.    as a move towards eu membership, turkey made some legal changes. the death penalty was removed from peacetime law by the national assembly in august 2002, and in may 2004 turkey amended its constitution in order to remove capital punishment in all circumstances. it ratified protocol no. 13 to the european convention on human rights in february 2006. as a result, europe is a continent free of the death penalty in practice, all states but russia, which has entered a moratorium, having ratified the sixth protocol to the european convention on human rights, with the sole exception of belarus, which is not a member of the council of europe. the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe has been lobbying for council of europe observer states who practise the death penalty, the u.s. and japan, to abolish it or lose their observer status. in addition to banning capital punishment for eu member states, the eu has also banned detainee transfers in cases where the receiving party may seek the death penalty.sub-saharan african countries that have recently abolished the death penalty include burundi, which abolished the death penalty for all crimes in 2009, and gabon which did the same in 2010. on 5 july 2012, benin became part of the second optional protocol to the international covenant on civil and political rights the newly created south sudan is among the 111 un member states that supported the resolution passed by the united nations general assembly that called for the removal of the death penalty, therefore affirming its opposition to the practice. south sudan, however, has not yet abolished the death penalty and stated that it must first amend its constitution, and until that happens it will continue to use the death penalty.among non-governmental organizations bibliography",1,0
"opioids are substances that, when reaching opioid receptors, have effects similar to those of morphine. medically they are primarily used for pain relief, including anesthesia. other medical uses include suppression of diarrhea, replacement therapy for opioid use disorder, reversing opioid overdose, suppressing cough, as well as execution in the united states. extremely potent opioids such as carfentanil are approved only for veterinary use. opioids are frequently used non-medically for their euphoric effects or to prevent withdrawal.side effects of opioids may include itchiness, sedation, nausea, respiratory depression, constipation, and euphoria. long-term use can cause tolerance, meaning that increased doses are required to achieve the same effect, and physical dependence, meaning that abruptly discontinuing the drug leads to unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. the euphoria attracts recreational use and frequent, escalating recreational use of opioids typically results in addiction. an overdose or concurrent use with other depressant drugs like benzodiazepines or alcohol commonly results in death from respiratory depression.opioids act by binding to opioid receptors. they are found principally in the central and peripheral nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. these receptors mediate both the psychoactive and the somatic effects of opioids. opioid drugs include partial agonists, like the anti-diarrhea drug loperamide and antagonists like naloxegol for opioid-induced constipation. they do not cross the blood-brain barrier, but can displace other opioids from binding to those receptors.69,000 people worldwide die of opioid overdose each year and 15 million people have an opioid addiction.because opioids are addictive and may result in fatal overdose, most are controlled substances. in 2013, between 28 and 38 million people used opioids illicitly  in 2011, an estimated 4 million people in the united states used opioids recreationally or were dependent on them. as of 2015, increased rates of recreational use and addiction were attributed to over-prescription of opioid medications and inexpensive illicit heroin. conversely, fears about over-prescribing, exaggerated side effects, and addiction from opioids are similarly blamed for under-treatment of pain.opioids include opiates, an older term that refers to such drugs derived from opium, including morphine itself. other opioids are semi-synthetic and synthetic drugs such as hydrocodone, oxycodone and fentanyl; antagonist drugs such as naloxone; and endogenous peptides such as the endorphins. the terms opiate and narcotic are sometimes encountered as synonyms for opioid. opiate is properly limited to the natural alkaloids found in the resin of the opium poppy although some include semi-synthetic derivatives. narcotic, derived from words meaning numbness or sleep, as an american legal term, refers to cocaine and opioids, and their source materials. it is also loosely applied to any illegal or controlled psychoactive drug. in some jurisdictions all controlled drugs are legally classified as narcotics. the term can have pejorative connotations and its use is generally discouraged where that is the case.the weak opioid codeine, in low doses and combined with one or more other drugs, is commonly available without a prescription and can be used to treat mild pain. other opioids are usually reserved for the relief of moderate to severe pain.opioids are effective for the treatment of acute pain  for immediate relief of moderate to severe acute pain, opioids are frequently the treatment of choice. this is due to their rapid onset, efficacy, and reduced risk of dependence. however, a new report showed a clear risk of prolonged opioid use when opioid analgesics are initiated for an acute pain management following surgery or trauma. they have also been found to be important in palliative care to help with the severe, chronic, disabling pain that may occur in some terminal conditions such as cancer and degenerative conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. in many cases, opioids are a successful long-term care strategy for those with chronic cancer pain.just over half of all states in the us have enacted law that restrict the prescribing or dispensing of opioid for acute pain.guidelines have suggested that the risk of opioids is likely greater than their benefits when used for most non-cancer chronic conditions including headaches, back pain, and fibromyalgia. thus, they should be used cautiously in chronic non-cancer pain. if used, the benefits and harms should be reassessed at least every three months.in treating chronic pain, opioids are an option to be tried after other less risky pain relievers have been considered. this includes paracetamol/acetaminophen or nsaids like ibuprofen or naproxen. some types of chronic pain, including the pain caused by fibromyalgia or migraine, are preferentially treated with drugs other than opioids. the efficacy of using opioids to lessen chronic neuropathic pain is uncertain.opioids are contraindicated as a first-line treatment for headache because they impair alertness, bring risk of dependence, and increase the risk that episodic headaches will become chronic. opioids can also cause heightened sensitivity to headache pain. when other treatments fail or are unavailable, opioids may be appropriate for treating headache if the patient can be monitored to prevent the development of chronic headache.opioids are being used more frequently in the management of non-malignant chronic pain. this practice has now led to a new and growing problem with addiction and misuse of opioids. because of various negative effects, the use of opioids for long-term management of chronic pain is not indicated unless other less risky pain relievers have been found ineffective. chronic pain, which occurs only periodically, such as that from nerve pain, migraines, and fibromyalgia, frequently is better treated with medications other than opioids. paracetamol and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs including ibuprofen and naproxen are considered safer alternatives. they are frequently used together with opioids, such as paracetamol combined with oxycodone codeine was once viewed as the ""gold standard"" in cough suppressants, but this position is now questioned. some recent placebo-controlled trials have found that it may be no better than a placebo for some causes including acute cough in children. thus, it is not recommended for children. additionally, there is no evidence that hydrocodone is useful in children. similarly, a 2012 dutch guideline regarding the treatment of acute cough does not recommend its use.  has similarly demonstrated little benefit in several recent studies.low dose morphine may help chronic cough but its use is limited by side effects.in cases of diarrhea-predominate irritable bowel syndrome, opioids may be used to suppress diarrhea. loperamide is a peripherally selective opioid available without a prescription and used to suppress diarrhea.the ability to suppress diarrhea also produces constipation when opioids are used beyond several weeks. naloxegol, a peripherally-selective opioid antagonist is now available to treat opioid induced constipation.opioids may help with shortness of breath particularly in advanced diseases such as cancer and copd among others.otherin older adults, opioid use is associated with increased adverse effects such as ""sedation, nausea, vomiting, constipation, urinary retention, and falls"". as a result, older adults taking opioids are at greater risk for injury. opioids do not cause any specific organ toxicity, unlike many other drugs, such as aspirin and paracetamol. they are not associated with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and kidney toxicity.the prescription of opioids for acute low back pain and management of osteoarthritis seems to have long-term adverse effectschildren born to opioid-dependent mothers, especially those prescribed methadone, are at risk for neurodevelopment impairment, having lower mental development index and lower psychomotor development index scores than unexposed children.research suggests that when methadone is used long-term it can build up unpredictably in the body and lead to potentially deadly slowed breathing. used medically, approaching toxicity goes unrecognized because the pain medication effect ends long before the drugs elimination half-life. according to the uscdc, methadone was involved in 31% of opioid related deaths in the us between 1999010 and 40% as the sole drug involved, far higher than other opioids. studies of long term opioids have found that adverse events may stop individuals from taking opioids long-term. in the united states in 2016, opioid overdose resulted in the death of 1.7 in 10,000 people.in the us charts below many deaths involve multiple opioids:us yearly deaths from all opioid drugs. included in this number are opioid analgesics, along with heroin and illicit synthetic opioids.us yearly deaths involving other synthetic opioids, predominately fentanyl.us yearly deaths involving prescription opioids. non-methadone synthetics is a category dominated by illegally acquired fentanyl, and has been excluded.us yearly overdose deaths involving heroin.fentanyl. 2018 cochrane review found that the evidence was tentative for alvimopan, naloxone, or methylnaltrexone bromide. naloxone by mouth appears to be the most effective. a daily 0.2mg dose of naldemedine has been shown to significantly improve symptoms in patients with oic.opioid rotation is one method suggested to minimise the impact of constipation in long-term users. while all opioids cause constipation, there are some differences between drugs, with studies suggesting tramadol, tapentadol, methadone and fentanyl may cause relatively less constipation, while with codeine, morphine, oxycodone or hydromorphone constipation may be comparatively more severe.respiratory depression is the most serious adverse reaction associated with opioid use, but it usually is seen with the use of a single, intravenous dose in an opioid-na4 hours after opioid administration appear to be the most critical with regard to life-threatening oird, but may be preventable with a more cautious approach to opioid use.patients with cardiac, respiratory disease and/or obstructive sleep apnoea are at increased risk for oird.opioid-induced hyperalgesia 013, the effect of low-dose or acute opioid use on the endocrine system is unclear. long-term use of opioids can affect the other hormonal systems as well.use of opioids may be a risk factor for failing to return to work.persons performing any safety-sensitive task should not use opioids. health care providers should not recommend that workers who drive or use heavy equipment including cranes or forklifts treat chronic or acute pain with opioids. workplaces which manage workers who perform safety-sensitive operations should assign workers to less sensitive duties for so long as those workers are treated by their physician with opioids.people who take opioids long term have increased likelihood of being unemployed. taking opioids may further disrupt the patients life and the adverse effects of opioids themselves can become a significant barrier to patients having an active life, gaining employment, and sustaining a career.in addition, lack of employment may be a predictor of aberrant use of prescription opioids.opioid use may increase accident-proneness. opioids may increase risk of traffic accidents and accidental falls.reduced attentionopioids have been shown to reduce attention, more so when used with antidepressants and/or anticonvulsants.hyperalgesiaopioid-induced hyperalgesia infrequent adverse reactions in patients taking opioids for pain relief include: dose-related respiratory depression both therapeutic and chronic use of opioids can compromise the function of the immune system.  opioids decrease the proliferation of macrophage progenitor cells and lymphocytes, and affect cell differentiation the concurrent use of opioids with other depressant drugs such as benzodiazepines or ethanol increases the rates of adverse events and overdose. the concurrent use of opioids with other depressant drugs such as benzodiazepines or ethanol increases the rates of adverse events and overdose. yet, opioids and benzodiazepines are concurrently dispensed in many settings. as with an overdose of opioid alone, the combination of an opioid and another depressant may precipitate respiratory depression often leading to death. these risks are lessened with close monitoring by a physician, who may conduct ongoing screening for changes in patient behavior and treatment compliance.opioid effects  these competitive antagonists bind to the opioid receptors with higher affinity than agonists but do not activate the receptors. this displaces the agonist, attenuating or reversing the agonist effects. however, the elimination half-life of naloxone can be shorter than that of the opioid itself, so repeat dosing or continuous infusion may be required, or a longer acting antagonist such as nalmefene may be used. in patients taking opioids regularly it is essential that the opioid is only partially reversed to avoid a severe and distressing reaction of waking in excruciating pain. this is achieved by not giving a full dose but giving this in small doses until the respiratory rate has improved. an infusion is then started to keep the reversal at that level, while maintaining pain relief. opioid antagonists remain the standard treatment for respiratory depression following opioid overdose, with naloxone being by far the most commonly used, although the longer acting antagonist nalmefene may be used for treating overdoses of long-acting opioids such as methadone, and diprenorphine is used for reversing the effects of extremely potent opioids used in veterinary medicine such as etorphine and carfentanil. however, since opioid antagonists also block the beneficial effects of opioid analgesics, they are generally useful only for treating overdose, with use of opioid antagonists alongside opioid analgesics to reduce side effects, requiring careful dose titration and often being poorly effective at doses low enough to allow analgesia to be maintained.naltrexone does not appear to increase risk of serious adverse events, which confirms the safety of oral naltrexone. mortality or serious adverse events due to rebound toxicity in patients with naloxone were rare.opioids bind to specific opioid receptors in the nervous system and other tissues.  there are three principal classes of opioid receptors, 07 million in 2013.in the 1990s, opioid prescribing increased significantly. once used almost exclusively for the treatment of acute pain or pain due to cancer, opioids are now prescribed liberally for people experiencing chronic pain. this has been accompanied by rising rates of accidental addiction and accidental overdoses leading to death. according to the international narcotics control board, the united states and canada lead the per capita consumption of prescription opioids. the number of opioid prescriptions per capita in the united states and canada is double the consumption in the european union, australia, and new zealand. certain populations have been affected by the opioid addiction crisis more than others, including first world communities and low-income populations. public health specialists say that this may result from the unavailability or high cost of alternative methods for addressing chronic pain. opioids have been described as a cost-effective treatment for chronic pain, but the impact of the opioid epidemic and deaths caused by opioid overdoses should be considered in assessing their cost-effectiveness. data from 2017 suggest that in the u.s. about 3.4 percent of the u.s. population are prescribed opioids for daily pain management. call for opioid deprescribing have led to broad scale opioid tapering practices with little scientific evidence to support the safety or benefit for patients with chronic pain.opioids are among the worlds oldest known drugs. the earliest known evidence of papaver somniferum in a human archaeological site dates to the neolithic period around 5,7000th century.other popular medicines, based on opium, included paregoric, a much milder liquid preparation for children; black-drop, a stronger preparation; and dovers powder.opium became a major colonial commodity, moving legally and illegally through trade networks involving india, the portuguese, the dutch, the british and china, among others.the british east india company saw the opium trade as an investment opportunity in 1683 ad. in 1773 the governor of bengal established a monopoly on the production of bengal opium, on behalf of the east india company. the cultivation and manufacture of indian opium was further centralized and controlled through a series of acts, between 1797 and 1949. the british balanced an economic deficit from the importation of chinese tea by selling indian opium which was smuggled into china in defiance of chinese government bans. this led to the first in the 19th century, two major scientific advances were made that had far-reaching effects. around 1804, german pharmacist friedrich sert by pierre jean robiquet. robiquet was reviewing a method for morphine extraction, described by scottish chemist william gregory   his discovery of the alkaloid led to the development of a generation of antitussive and antidiarrheal medicines based on codeine.synthetic opioids were invented, and biological mechanisms for their actions discovered, in the 20th century. scientists have searched for non-addictive forms of opioids, but have created stronger ones instead. in england charles romley alder wright developed hundreds of opiate compounds in his search for a nonaddictive opium derivative. in 1874 he became the first person to synthesize diamorphine heroin received little attention until it was independently synthesized by felix hoffmann  dreser brought the new drug to market as an analgesic and a cough treatment for tuberculosis, bronchitis, and asthma in 1898. bayer ceased production in 1913, after heroins addictive potential was recognized.several semi-synthetic opioids were developed in germany in the 1910s.  the first, oxymorphone, was synthesized from thebaine, an opioid alkaloid in opium poppies, in 1914.next, martin freund and edmund speyer developed oxycodone, also from thebaine, at the university of frankfurt in 1916.in 1920, hydrocodone was prepared by carl mannich and helene l4, hydromorphone was synthesized by adding hydrogen to morphine. etorphine was synthesized in 1960, from the oripavine in opium poppy straw. buprenorphine was discovered in 1972.the first fully synthetic opioid was meperidine  meperidine was the first opiate to have a structure unrelated to morphine, but with opiate-like properties. its analgesis effects were discovered by otto schaumann in 1939.gustav ehrhart and max bockm0"" in 1959 the belgian physician paul janssen developed fentanyl, a synthetic drug with 30 to 50 times the potency of heroin.nearly 150 synthetic opioids are now known.non-clinical use of opium was criminalized in the united states by the harrison narcotics tax act of 1914, and by many other laws. the use of opioids was stigmatized, and it was seen as a dangerous substance, to be prescribed only as a last resort for dying patients. the controlled substances act of 1970 eventually relaxed the harshness of the harrison act.in the united kingdom the 1926 report of the departmental committee on morphine and heroin addiction under the chairmanship of the president of the royal college of physicians reasserted medical control and established the ""british system"" of control000 and 2014 there was an ""alarming increase in heroin use across the country and an epidemic of drug overdose deaths"".as a result, health care organizations and public health groups, such as physicians for responsible opioid prescribing, have called for decreases in the prescription of opioids. in 2016, the centers for disease control and prevention in april 2019 the u.s. food and drug administration announced the launch of a new education campaign to help americans understand the important role they play in removing and properly disposing of unused prescription opioids from their homes. this new initiative is part of the fdas continued efforts to address the nationwide opioid crisis the term ""opioid"" originated in the 1950s. it combines ""opium"" + ""-oid"" meaning ""opiate-like""  by the late 1960s, research found that opiate effects are mediated by activation of specific molecular receptors in the nervous system, which were termed ""opioid receptors"". the definition of ""opioid"" was later refined to refer to substances that have morphine-like activities that are mediated by the activation of opioid receptors. one modern pharmacology textbook states: ""the term opioid applies to all agonists and antagonists with morphine-like activity, and also the naturally occurring and synthetic opioid peptides"". another pharmacology reference eliminates the morphine-like requirement: ""opioid, a more modern term, is used to designate all substances, both natural and synthetic, that bind to opioid receptors  some sources define the term opioid to exclude opiates, and others use opiate comprehensively instead of opioid, but opioid used inclusively is considered modern, preferred and is in wide use.in 2011, the obama administration released a white paper describing the administrations plan to deal with the opioid crisis. the administrations concerns about addiction and accidental overdosing have been echoed by numerous other medical and government advisory groups around the world.as of 2015, prescription drug monitoring programs exist in every state, except for missouri. these programs allow pharmacists and prescribers to access patients prescription histories in order to identify suspicious use. however, a survey of us physicians published in 2015 found that only 53% of doctors used these programs, while 22% were not aware that the programs were available to them. the centers for disease control and prevention was tasked with establishing and publishing a new guideline, and was heavily lobbied. in 2016, the united states centers for disease control and prevention published its guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic pain, recommending that opioids only be used when benefits for pain and function are expected to outweigh risks, and then used at the lowest effective dosage, with avoidance of concurrent opioid and benzodiazepine use whenever possible. research suggests that the prescription of high doses of opioids related to chronic opioid therapy on 10 august 2017, donald trump declared the opioid crisis a morphine and other poppy-based medicines have been identified by the world health organization as essential in the treatment of severe pain. as of 2002, seven countries  the current system of supply of raw poppy materials to make poppy-based medicines is regulated by the international narcotics control board under the provision of the 1961 single convention on narcotic drugs. the amount of raw poppy materials that each country can demand annually based on these provisions must correspond to an estimate of the countrys needs taken from the national consumption within the preceding two years. in many countries, underprescription of morphine is rampant because of the high prices and the lack of training in the prescription of poppy-based drugs. the world health organization is now working with administrations from various countries to train healthworkers and to develop national regulations regarding drug prescription to facilitate a greater prescription of poppy-based medicines.another idea to increase morphine availability is proposed by the senlis council, who suggest, through their proposal for afghan morphine, that afghanistan could provide cheap pain relief solutions to emerging countries as part of a second-tier system of supply that would complement the current incb regulated system by maintaining the balance and closed system that it establishes while providing finished product morphine to those suffering from severe pain and unable to access poppy-based drugs under the current system.opioids can produce strong feelings of euphoria and are frequently used recreationally. traditionally associated with illicit opioids such as heroin, prescription opioids are misused recreationally.drug misuse and non-medical use include the use of drugs for reasons or at doses other than prescribed. opioid misuse can also include providing medications to persons for whom it was not prescribed. such diversion may be treated as crimes, punishable by imprisonment in many countries. in 2014, almost 2 million americans abused or were dependent on prescription opioids.there are a number of broad classes of opioids:tramadol and tapentadol, which act as monoamine uptake inhibitors also act as mild and potent agonists  both drugs produce analgesia even when naloxone, an opioid antagonist, is administered.some minor opium alkaloids and various substances with opioid action are also found elsewhere, including molecules present in kratom, corydalis, and salvia divinorum plants and some species of poppy aside from papaver somniferum. there are also strains which produce copious amounts of thebaine, an important raw material for making many semi-synthetic and synthetic opioids.  of all of the more than 120 poppy species, only two produce morphine.amongst analgesics there are a small number of agents which act on the central nervous system but not on the opioid receptor system and therefore have none of the other other analgesics work peripherally  a significant fraction  inflammatory pain is also blunted by endogenous opioid peptides activating peripheral opioid receptors.it was discovered in 1953, that humans and some animals naturally produce minute amounts of morphine, codeine, and possibly some of their simpler derivatives like heroin and dihydromorphine, in addition to endogenous opioid peptides.  some bacteria are capable of producing some semi-synthetic opioids such as hydromorphone and hydrocodone when living in a solution containing morphine or codeine respectively.many of the alkaloids and other derivatives of the opium poppy are not opioids or narcotics; the best example is the smooth-muscle relaxant papaverine. noscapine is a marginal case as it does have cns effects but not necessarily similar to morphine, and it is probably in a category all its own.dextromethorphan -enkephalin is a product of the proenkephalin gene, and acts through

"a seashell or sea shell, also known simply as a shell, is a hard, protective outer layer usually created by an animal that lives in the sea. the shell is part of the body of the animal. empty seashells are often found washed up on beaches by beachcombers. the shells are empty because the animal has died and the soft parts have been eaten by another animal or have decomposed.a seashell is usually the exoskeleton of an invertebrate  this type of large-scale exploitation can sometimes have a strong negative impact on local ecosystems, and sometimes can significantly reduce the distribution of rare species.the word seashell is often used to mean only the shell of a marine mollusk. marine mollusk shells that are familiar to beachcombers and thus most likely to be called ""seashells"" are the shells of marine species of bivalves small pieces of colored and iridescent shell have been used to create mosaics and inlays, which have been used to decorate walls, furniture and boxes. large numbers of whole seashells, arranged to form patterns, have been used to decorate mirror frames, furniture and man-made grottos.a very large outdoor sculpture at akkulam of a gastropod seashell is a reference to the sacred chank shell turbinella pyrum of india. in 2003, maggi hambling designed a striking 13\xa0ft seashells, namely from bivalves and gastropods, are fundamentally composed of calcium carbonate. in this sense, they have potential to be used as raw material in the production of lime. along the gulf coast of the united states, oyster shells were mixed into cement to make ""shellcrete"" which could form bricks, blocks and platforms. it could also be applied over logs. a notable example is the 19th-century sabine pass lighthouse in louisiana, near texas.many arthropods have sclerites, or hardened body parts, which form a stiff exoskeleton made up mostly of chitin.  in crustaceans, especially those of the class malacostraca  while living in a safe environment and using the carbon dioxide and nitrogenous waste produced by the polyp.  coral bleaching is a disruption of the balance between polyps and algae, and can lead to the breakdown and death of coral reefs.the skeletons of soft corals such as gorgonians, also known as sea fans and sea whips, commonly wash ashore in the tropics after storms.plant-like diatoms and animal-like radiolarians are two forms of plankton which form hard silicate shells. foraminifera and coccolithophores create shells known as ""tests"" which are made of calcium carbonate. these shells and tests are usually microscopic in size, though in the case of foraminifera, they are sometimes visible to the naked eye, often resembling miniature mollusk shells.",1,0

horn. its hairless, hazy gray skin falls into folds into the shoulder, back, and rump, giving it an armored appearance. its length reaches 3.1,0006015, only 58011 by vietnamese poachers. now only java contains the last javan rhinos.the sumatran rhinoceros plantations for palm oil have taken out the living areas and led to the eradication of the rhino in sumatra.rhinocerotoids diverged from other perissodactyls by the early eocene. fossils of hyrachyus eximus found in north america date to this period. this small hornless ancestor resembled a tapir or small horse more than a rhino. three families, sometimes grouped together as the superfamily rhinocerotoidea, evolved in the late eocene, namely the hyracodontidae, amynodontidae and rhinocerotidae.hyracodontidae, also known as ""running rhinos"", showed adaptations for speed, and would have looked more like horses than modern rhinos. the smallest hyracodontids were dog-sized; the largest was paraceratherium, one of the largest known land mammals that ever existed. the hornless paraceratherium was almost five metres high and ten metres long and weighed as much as 15 tons. like a giraffe, it ate leaves from trees. hyracodontids spread across eurasia from the mid-eocene to early miocene.the amynodontidae, also known as ""aquatic rhinos"", dispersed across north america and eurasia, from the late eocene to early oligocene. the amynodontids were hippopotamus-like in their ecology and appearance, inhabiting rivers and lakes, and sharing many of the same adaptations to aquatic life as hippos.the family of all modern rhinoceros, the rhinocerotidae, first appeared in the late eocene in eurasia. the earliest members of rhinocerotidae were small and numerous; at least 26 genera lived in eurasia and north america until a wave of extinctions in the middle oligocene wiped out most of the smaller species. however, several independent lineages survived. menoceras, a pig-sized rhinoceros, had two horns side-by-side. the north american teleoceras had short legs, a barrel chest and lived until about 5 million years ago. the last rhinos in the americas became extinct during the pliocene.modern rhinos are thought to have begun dispersal from asia during the miocene. alongside the extant species, four additional species of rhinoceros survived into the last glacial period: the woolly rhinoceros, elasmotherium sibiricum and two species of stephanorhinus, mercks rhinoceros and the narrow-nosed rhinoceros. the woolly rhinoceros appeared in china around 1 million years ago and first arrived in europe around 600,000 years ago. it reappeared 200,000 years ago, alongside the woolly mammoth, and became numerous. elasmotherium was two meters tall, five meters long and weighed around five tons, with a single enormous horn, hypsodont teeth and long legs for running. the latest known well dated bones of elasmotheriumin found in the south of western siberia the origin of the two living african rhinos can be traced to the late miocene  the black and white rhinoceros remain so closely related that they can still mate and successfully produce offspring.adult rhinoceros have no real predators in the wild, other than humans. young rhinos can however fall prey to big cats, crocodiles, african wild dogs, and hyenas.although rhinos are large and aggressive and have a reputation for being resilient, they are very easily poached; they visit water holes daily and can be easily killed while they drink. as of december 2009, poaching increased globally while efforts to protect the rhino are considered increasingly ineffective. the most serious estimate, that only 3% of poachers are successfully countered, is reported of zimbabwe, while nepal has largely avoided the crisis. poachers have become more sophisticated. south african officials have called for urgent action against poaching after poachers killed the last female rhino in the krugersdorp game reserve near johannesburg. statistics from south african national parks show that 333 rhinoceros were killed in south africa in 2010, increasing to 668 by 2012, over 1,004 in 2013, and over 1,338 killed in 2015. in some cases rhinos are drugged and their horns removed, while in other instances more than the horn is taken.the namibian government has supported the practice of rhino trophy hunting as a way to raise money for conservation. hunting licenses for five namibian black rhinos are auctioned annually, with the money going to the governments game products trust fund. some conservationists and members of the public however oppose or question this practice.international trade in rhinoceros horn has been declared illegal by the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora  a proposal by swaziland to lift the international ban was rejected in october 2016.domestic sale of rhinoceros horn in south africa, home of 80% of the remaining rhino population, was banned as of 2009. however, that ban was overturned in a court case in 2017, and south africa plans to draft regulations for the sale of rhino horn, possibly including export for ""non-commercial purposes"". the south african government has proposed that a legal trade of rhino horn be established, arguing that this could reduce poaching and prevent the extinction of this species.rhinoceros horns, unlike those of other horned mammals,  in europe, it was historically believed that rhino horns could purify water and could detect poisoned liquids, and likely as an aphrodisiac and an antidote to poison.the vietnamese are the biggest consumers of rhino horn, and their demand drives most of the poaching, which has risen to record levels. the ""vietnam cites management authority"" has claimed that hanoi recently experienced a 77% drop in the usage of rhino horn, but national geographic has challenged these claims, noticing that there was no rise in the numbers of criminals who were apprehended or prosecuted. south african rhino poachings main destination market is vietnam. an average sized horn can bring in as much as a quarter of a million dollars in vietnam and many rhino range states have stockpiles of rhino horn.it is a common misconception that rhinoceros horn in powdered form is used as an aphrodisiac or a cure for cancer in traditional chinese medicine as cornu rhinoceri asiatici  in traditional chinese medicine  a treatment not supported by evidence-based medicine: this treatment has been compared to consuming fingernail clippings in water. in 1993, china signed the cites treaty and removed rhinoceros horn from the chinese medicine pharmacopeia, administered by the ministry of health. in 2011, the register of chinese herbal medicine in the united kingdom issued a formal statement condemning the use of rhinoceros horn. a growing number of tcm educators are also speaking out against the practice, although some tcm practitioners still believe that it is a life-saving medicine.in march 2013, some researchers suggested that the only way to reduce poaching would be to establish a regulated trade based on humane and renewable harvesting from live rhinos. the wwf however opposes legalization of the horn trade, as it may increase demand, while ifaw released a report by ecolarge, suggesting that more thorough knowledge of economic factors is required to justify the pro-trade option.to prevent poaching, in certain areas, rhinos have been tranquillized and their horns removed. armed park rangers, particularly in south africa, are also working on the front lines to combat poaching, sometimes killing poachers who are caught in the act. a 2012 spike in rhino killings increased concerns about the future of the species.in 2011, the rhino rescue project began a horn-trade control method consisting of infusing the horns of living rhinos with a mixture of a pink dye and an acaricide  the procedure also includes inserting three rfid identification chips and taking dna samples. because of the fibrous nature of rhino horn, the pressurized dye infuses the interior of the horn but does not color the surface or affect rhino behavior. depending on the quantity of horn a person consumes, experts believe the acaricide would cause nausea, stomach-ache, and diarrhea, and possibly convulsions. it would not be fatal\x80\x9330,000 years ago.there are legends about rhinoceroses stamping out fire in burma, india, and malaysia. the mythical rhinoceros has a special name in malay, badak api, wherein badak means rhinoceros, and api means fire. the animal would come when a fire was lit in the forest and stamp it out. there are no recent confirmations of this phenomenon. this legend was depicted in the film the gods must be crazy in 1974 a lavender rhinoceros symbol began to be used as a symbol of the gay community in boston.",1,0
"same-sex marriage, also known as gay marriage, is the marriage of two people of the same sex or gender, entered into in a civil or religious ceremony. there are records of same-sex marriage dating back to the first century. in the modern era, the first legislation legalizing same-sex marriage took effect in the netherlands on 1 april 2001.today, same-sex marriage is legally performed and recognized in 29 countries the introduction of same-sex marriage  or by direct popular vote  the most prominent supporters of same-sex marriage are human rights and civil rights organizations as well as the medical and scientific communities, while the most prominent opponents are religious fundamentalist groups. polls consistently show continually rising support for the recognition of same-sex marriage in all developed democracies and in some developing democracies.scientific studies show that the financial, psychological, and physical well-being of gay people are enhanced by marriage, and that the children of same-sex parents benefit from being raised by married same-sex couples within a marital union that is recognized by law and supported by societal institutions. social science research indicates that the exclusion of homosexuals from marriage stigmatizes and invites public discrimination against them, with research also repudiating the notion that either civilization or viable social orders depend upon restricting marriage to heterosexuals. same-sex marriage can provide those in committed same-sex relationships with relevant government services and make financial demands on them comparable to that required of those in opposite-sex marriages, and also gives them legal protections such as inheritance and hospital visitation rights. opposition to same-sex marriage is based on claims such as that homosexuality is unnatural and abnormal, that the recognition of same-sex unions will promote homosexuality in society, and that children are better off when raised by opposite-sex couples. these claims are refuted by scientific studies, which show that homosexuality is a natural and normal variation in human sexuality, and that sexual orientation is not a choice. many studies have shown that children of same-sex couples fare just as well as the children of opposite-sex couples; some studies have shown benefits to being raised by same-sex couples.a study of nationwide data from across the united states from january 1999 to december 2015 revealed that the establishment of same-sex marriage is associated with a significant reduction in the rate of attempted suicide among children, with the effect being concentrated among children of a minority sexual orientation, resulting in about 134,000 fewer children attempting suicide each year in the united states.some proponents of the legal recognition of same-sex marriage1st century, all major english dictionaries have revised their definition of the word marriage to either drop gender specifications or supplement them with secondary definitions to include gender-neutral language or explicit recognition of same-sex unions. the oxford english dictionary has recognized same-sex marriage since 2000.opponents of same-sex marriage who want marriage to be restricted to pairings of a man and a woman, such as the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints, the catholic church, and the southern baptist convention, use the term traditional marriage to mean opposite-sex marriage.the american anthropological association stated on 26 february 2004:the results of more than a century of anthropological research on households, kinship relationships, and families, across cultures and through time, provide no support whatsoever for the view that either civilization or viable social orders depend upon marriage as an exclusively heterosexual institution. rather, anthropological research supports the conclusion that a vast array of family types, including families built upon same-sex partnerships, can contribute to stable and humane societies.research findings from 1998 to 2015 from the university of virginia, michigan state university, florida state university, the university of amsterdam, the new york state psychiatric institute, stanford university, the university of california-san francisco, the university of california-los angeles, tufts university, boston medical center, the committee on psychosocial aspects of child and family health, and independent researchers also support the findings of this study.a study of nationwide data from across the united states from january 1999 to december 2015 revealed that the rate of attempted suicide among school students in grades 9 declined by 7% and the rate of attempted suicide among high schoolers of a minority sexual orientation in grades 9 declined by 14% in states that established same-sex marriage, resulting in about 134,000 fewer attempting suicide each year in the united states. the researchers took advantage of the gradual manner in which same-sex marriage was established in the united states professional organizations of psychologists have concluded that children stand to benefit from the well-being that results when their parents relationship is recognized and supported by societys institutions, e.g. civil marriage. for example, the canadian psychological association stated in 2006 that ""parents financial, psychological and physical well-being is enhanced by marriage and that children benefit from being raised by two parents within a legally-recognized union."" the cpa has stated that the stress encountered by gay and lesbian parents and their children are more likely the result of the way society treats them than because of any deficiencies in fitness to parent.the american academy of pediatrics concluded in 2006, in an analysis published in the journal pediatrics:there is ample evidence to show that children raised by same-gender parents fare as well as those raised by heterosexual parents. more than 25 years of research have documented that there is no relationship between parents sexual orientation and any measure of a childs emotional, psychosocial, and behavioral adjustment. conscientious and nurturing adults, whether they are men or women, heterosexual or homosexual, can be excellent parents. the rights, benefits, and protections of civil marriage can further strengthen these families.in 2010, a columbia university mailman school of public health study examining the effects of institutional discrimination on the psychiatric health of lesbian, gay and bisexual author and journalist jonathan rauch has argued that marriage is good for all men, whether homosexual or heterosexual, because engaging in its social roles reduces mens aggression and promiscuity. the data of current psychological and other social science studies on same-sex marriage in comparison to mixed-sex marriage indicate that same-sex and mixed-sex relationships do not differ in their essential psychosocial dimensions; that a parents sexual orientation is unrelated to their ability to provide a healthy and nurturing family environment; and that marriage bestows substantial psychological, social, and health benefits. same-sex parents and carers and their children are likely to benefit in numerous ways from legal recognition of their families, and providing such recognition through marriage will bestow greater benefit than civil unions or domestic partnerships.the american psychological association stated in 2004: ""denial of access to marriage to same-sex couples may especially harm people who also experience discrimination based on age, race, ethnicity, disability, gender and gender identity, religion, socioeconomic status and so on."" it has also averred that same-sex couples who may only enter into a civil union, as opposed to a marriage, ""are denied equal access to all the benefits, rights, and privileges provided by federal law to those of married couples"", which has adverse effects on the well-being of same-sex partners.in 2009, a pair of economists at emory university tied the passage of state bans on same-sex marriage in the united states to an increase in the rates of hiv infection. the study linked the passage of a same-sex marriage ban in a state to an increase in the annual hiv rate within that state of roughly 4 cases per 100,000 population.numerous polls and studies on the issue have been conducted. a trend of increasing support for same-sex marriage has been revealed across many countries of the world, often driven in large part by a generational difference in support. polling that was conducted in developed democracies in this century shows a majority of people in support of same-sex marriage. support for legal same-sex marriage has increased across every age group, political ideology, religion, gender, race and region of various developed countries in the world.various detailed polls and studies on same-sex marriage that were conducted in several countries show that support for same-sex marriage significantly increases with higher levels of education and is also significantly stronger among younger generations, with a clear trend of continually increasing support.a reference to same-sex marriage appears in the sifra, which was written in the 3rd century ce. the book of leviticus prohibited homosexual relations, and the hebrews were warned not to ""follow the acts of the land of egypt or the acts of the land of canaan"" what is arguably the first historical mention of the performance of same-sex marriages occurred during the early roman empire according to controversial historian john boswell. these were usually reported in a critical or satirical manner.child emperor elagabalus referred to his chariot driver, a blond slave from caria named hierocles, as his husband. he also married an athlete named zoticus in a lavish public ceremony in rome amidst the rejoicings of the citizens.the first roman emperor to have married a man was nero, who is reported to have married two other males on different occasions. the first was with one of neros own freedmen, pythagoras, with whom nero took the role of the bride. later, as a groom, nero married sporus, a young boy, to replace the adolescent female concubine he had killed and married him in a very public ceremony with all the solemnities of matrimony, after which sporus was forced to pretend to be the female concubine that nero had killed and act as though they were really married. a friend gave the ""bride"" away as required by law. the marriage was celebrated in both greece and rome in extravagant public ceremonies.conubium existed only between a civis romanus and a civis romana  furthermore, according to susan treggiari, ""matrimonium was then an institution involving a mother, mater. the idea implicit in the word is that a man took a woman in marriage, in matrimonium ducere, so that he might have children by her.""in 342 ad, christian emperors constantius ii and constans issued a law in the theodosian code  professor fontaine of cornell university classics department has pointed out that there is not provision for same-sex marriage in roman law, and the text from 342 a.d. is corrupt, ""marries a woman"" might be ""goes to bed in a dishonorable manner with a man"" as a condemnation of homosexual behavior between men.historians variously trace the beginning of the modern movement in support of same-sex marriage to anywhere from around the 1970s to the 1990s.in 1989, denmark became the first country to recognize a legal relationship for same-sex couples, establishing registered partnerships, which gave those in same-sex relationships ""most rights of married heterosexuals, but not the right to adopt or obtain joint custody of a child"". in 2001, the netherlands became the first country to establish same-sex marriage by law. since then same-sex marriage has also been established by law in belgium    note: countries and territories in which same-sex marriage laws have been repealed are not included on the table.in 2010, the european court of human rights  the court found, by a vote of 4 to 3, that their human rights had not been violated.british judge sir nicolas bratza, then head of the european court of human rights, delivered a speech in 2012 that signaled the court was ready to declare same-sex marriage a ""human right"", as soon as enough countries fell into line.article 12 of the european convention on human rights states that: ""men and women of marriageable age have the right to marry and to found a family, according to the national laws governing the exercise of this right"", not limiting marriage to those in a heterosexual relationship. however, the echr stated in schalk and kopf v austria that this provision was intended to limit marriage to heterosexual relationships, as it used the term ""men and women"" instead of ""everyone"".on 12 march 2015, the european parliament passed a non-binding resolution encouraging eu institutions and member states to "" on the recognition of same-sex marriage or same-sex civil union as a political, social and human and civil rights issue"".on 5 june 2018, the european court of justice ruled, in a case from romania, that, under the specific conditions of the couple in question, married same-sex couples have the same residency rights as other married couples in an eu country, even if that country does not permit or recognize same-sex marriage.after a motion lodged by costa rica, the inter-american court of human rights issued a landmark advisory ruling in favour of same-sex marriage on 9 january 2018, which is expected to facilitate legalisation in several countries in the americas.the court said that governments ""must recognise and guarantee all the rights that are derived from a family bond between people of the same sex"". they also said that it was inadmissible and discriminatory for a separate legal provision to be established the court issued its ruling in response to a motion brought by costa rica in 2016. the costa rican government asked the court to give its opinion on whether it had an obligation to extend property rights to same-sex couples, and the court ruled that it did. the costa rican government also wanted to know whether it should allow transgender people to change their name and gender on their identity documents. again, the court ruled that it must.the government of costa rica announced that they will fully implement the iachr ruling. additionally, on 11 january, the president of the supreme court of peru and chairman of the countrys judiciary, duberl9 january 2018, housing minister carlos bruce estimated that same-sex marriage will be allowed in peru within two years, and several former supreme court judges and lawmakers, notably indira huilca, stated that same-sex marriage will soon be

months to reform the law accordingly, otherwise the ban would be abolished automatically. this was in line with the iachr ruling.besides ecuador and costa rica, lawsuits regarding same-sex marriage have been filed in honduras, panama, paraguay  and peru, all of which are under the jurisdiction of the iachr. in panama the previous government of juan carlos varela announced that it would implement the ruling and communicated this to the other branches of government, but under his successors government the panamanian congress approved a constitutional reform banning same-sex marriage. the reform, alongside others, caused massive protests that caused president laurentino cortizo to criticize the lawmakers and a committee was created to analyze the more polemic reforms.same-sex marriage is legally performed and recognized  the netherlands, new zealand, norway, portugal, south africa, spain, sweden, taiwan, the united kingdom, the united states, and uruguay.furthermore, the

justiciable controversy"", additionally finding the plaintiffs legal team liable for indirect contempt of court for ""using constitutional litigation for propaganda purposes.""on 5 june 2018, the european court of justice initially, the case was filed with the romanian constitutional court, which later decided to consult with the ecj. in line with the ecj ruling, the constitutional court ruled on 18 july 2018 that the state must grant residency rights to the same-sex partners of european union citizens.in june 2019, accept and 14 people forming seven same-sex couples have sued the romanian state to the european court of human rights slovenia recognises registered partnerships for same-sex couples.in december 2014, the eco-socialist united left party introduced a bill amending the definition of marriage in the 1976 marriage and family relations act to include same-sex couples. in january 2015, the government expressed no opposition to the bill. in february 2015, the bill was passed with 11 votes to 2. in march, the assembly passed the final bill in a 518 vote. on 10 march 2015, the national council rejected a motion to require the assembly to vote on the bill again, in a 143 vote. opponents of the bill launched a petition for a referendum and managed to collect 40,000 signatures. the parliament then voted to block the referendum with a clarification that it would be against the slovenian constitution to vote on matters concerning human rights. finally, the constitutional court ruled against the banning of the referendum in july 2015, kim jho kwang-soo and his partner, kim seung-hwan, filed a lawsuit seeking legal status for their marriage after their marriage registration form was rejected by the local authorities in seoul. on 25 may 2016, a south korean district court ruled against the couple and argued that without clear legislation a same-sex union can not be recognized as a marriage. the couple quickly filed an appeal against the district court ruling. their lawyer, ryu min-hee, announced that two more same-sex couples had filed separate lawsuits in order to be allowed to wed.in december 2016, a south korean appeals court upheld the district court ruling. the couple vowed to bring the case to the supreme court of south korea.a 2017 poll found that 41% of south koreans supported same-sex marriage, while 52% were opposed. support is significantly higher among younger people, however, with a 2014 opinion poll showing that 60% of south koreans in their 20s supported same-sex marriage, about double that of 2010 a same-sex marriage bill is pending in parliament after the green liberal party of switzerland, introduced a constitutional initiative to legalize same-sex marriage in december 2013, in opposition to a christian democrat initiative banning same-sex marriage. the committee for legal affairs of the national council approved the green liberal initiative by 12-9 and 1 abstention on 20 february 2015. on 1 september 2015, the upper houses legal affairs committee voted 7 to 5 to proceed with the initiative. the national councils legal affairs committee can now draft an act.in a poll in june 2013 for ifop, 63% approved of same-sex marriage. after the national councils committee of law affairs decision to approve same-sex marriage, two opinion polls released on 22 february 2015 showed support of 54%  and 71%  allowing same-sex couples to marry and adopt children. additionally, in november 2016, voters in the canton of z017 poll found that 75% of swiss were in favour of same-sex marriage.in march 2015, the swiss federal council released a governmental report about marriage and new rights for families. it opens the possibility to introduce registered partnerships for different-sex couples as well as same-sex marriage for same-sex couples. federal councillor simonetta sommaruga in charge of the federal department of justice and police also stated she hoped personally that same-sex couples would soon be allowed to marry.the christian democratic peoples party of switzerland  on 19 june 2015, the parliament recommended that voters reject the initiative. the federal council also recommended rejecting the initiative. the swiss people voted on the christian democrats proposal in a referendum on 28 february 2016 and rejected it by 50.8% of the votes.in april 2016, the supreme court announced it would hear a lawsuit that seeks to declare article 44 of the civil code unconstitutional for outlawing same-sex marriage.president nicol012, and planned to further discuss the issue at the national assembly in spring 2013. however, in february 2013, the ministry of justice requested that the national assembly avoid action until 2014. at a hearing to discuss marriage law reforms in april 2013, deputy minister of health nguyen viet tien proposed that same-sex marriage be made legal immediately.the vietnamese government abolished an administrative fine imposed on same-sex weddings in 2013. the policy was enacted on 11 november 2013. the 100,000013, the national assembly began formal debate on a proposal to establish legal recognition for same-sex marriage. on 24 september 2013, the government issued the decree abolishing the fines on same-sex marriages. the decree took effect on 11 november 2013.on 27 may 2014, the national assemblys committee for social affairs removed the provision giving legal status and some rights to cohabiting same-sex couples from the governments bill to amend the law on marriage and family. the bill was approved by the national assembly on 19 june 2014.on 1 january 2015, the 2014 law on marriage and family officially went into effect. it states that while vietnam allows same-sex weddings, it will not offer legal recognition or protection to unions between people of the same sex.the terms of employment of the staff of international organizations  in some cases, these organizations do offer a limited selection of the benefits normally provided to mixed-sex married couples to de facto partners or domestic partners of their staff, but even individuals who have entered into a mixed-sex civil union in their home country are not guaranteed full recognition of this union in all organizations. however, the world bank does recognize domestic partners.civil union, civil partnership, domestic partnership, registered partnership, unregistered partnership, and unregistered cohabitation statuses offer varying legal benefits of marriage. as of 20 december 2020, countries that have an alternative form of legal recognition other than marriage on a national level are: andorra, chile, croatia, cyprus, the czech republic, estonia, greece, hungary, israel, italy, liechtenstein, san marino, slovenia and switzerland. poland and slovakia offer more limited rights. on a subnational level, the mexican state of tlaxcala, and the dutch constituent country of aruba allow same-sex couples to access civil unions or partnerships, but restrict marriage to couples of the opposite sex. additionally, various cities and counties in cambodia and japan offer same-sex couples varying levels of benefits, which include hospital visitation rights and others.additionally, sixteen countries that have legalized same-sex marriage still have an alternative form of legal recognition for same-sex couples, usually available to heterosexual couples as well: argentina, australia, austria, belgium, brazil, colombia, ecuador, france, luxembourg, malta, the netherlands, portugal, south africa, spain, the united kingdom and uruguay.they are also available in parts of the united states female same-sex marriage is practiced among the gikuyu, nandi, kamba, kipsigis, and to a lesser extent neighboring peoples. about 5010, more than 16,000 same-sex couples were raising an estimated 22,000 adopted children in the united states, 4% of all adopted children.a gay or bisexual man has the option of surrogacy, the process in which a woman bears a child for another person through artificial insemination or carries another womans surgically implanted fertilized egg to birth. a lesbian or bisexual woman has the option of artificial insemination.the legal status of same-sex marriage may have implications for the marriages of couples in which one or both parties are transgender, depending on how sex is defined within a jurisdiction. transgender and intersex individuals may be prohibited from marrying partners of the ""opposite"" sex or permitted to marry partners of the ""same"" sex due to legal distinctions.in any legal jurisdiction where marriages are defined without distinction of a requirement of a male and female, these complications do not occur. in addition, some legal jurisdictions recognize a legal and official change of gender, which would allow a transgender male or female to be legally married in accordance with an adopted gender identity.in the united kingdom, the gender recognition act 2004 allows a person who has lived in their chosen gender for at least two years to receive a gender recognition certificate officially recognizing their new gender. because in the united kingdom marriages were until recently only for mixed-sex couples and civil partnerships are only for same-sex couples, a person must dissolve his/her civil partnership before obtaining a gender recognition certificate, and the same was formerly true for marriages in england and wales, and still is in other territories. such people are then free to enter or re-enter civil partnerships or marriages in accordance with their newly recognized gender identity. in austria, a similar provision requiring transsexual people to divorce before having their legal sex marker corrected was found to be unconstitutional in 2006.in quebec, prior to the legalization of same-sex marriage, only unmarried people could apply for legal change of gender. with the advent of same-sex marriage, this restriction was dropped. a similar provision including sterilization also existed in sweden, but was phased out in 2013.in the united states, transgender and intersex marriages can be subject to legal complications. as definitions and enforcement of marriage are defined by the states, these complications vary from state to state, as some of them prohibit legal changes of gender.in the united states of america before the case of obergefell v. hodges, couples in same-sex marriages could only obtain a divorce in jurisdictions that recognized same-sex marriages, with some exceptions.there are differing positions regarding the manner in which same-sex marriage has been introduced into democratic jurisdictions. a ""majority rules"" position holds that same-sex marriage is valid, or void and illegal, based upon whether it has been accepted by a simple majority of voters or of their elected representatives.in contrast, a civil rights view holds that the institution can be validly created through the ruling of an impartial judiciary carefully examining the questioning and finding that the right to marry regardless of the gender of the participants is guaranteed under the civil rights laws of the jurisdiction.documentaries and literaturehistorycategory:lgbt culture",1,0
"music is an art form, and a cultural activity, whose medium is sound. general definitions of music include common elements such as pitch see glossary of musical terminology.in its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form or cultural activity include the creation of works of music the creation, performance, significance, and even the definition of music vary according to culture and social context. indeed, throughout history, some new forms or styles of music have been criticized as ""not being music"", including beethovens grosse fuge string quartet in 1825, early jazz in the beginning of the 1900s and hardcore punk in the 1980s. there are many types of music, including popular music, traditional music, art music, music written for religious ceremonies and work songs such as chanteys. music ranges from strictly organized compositions0th and 21st centuries.music can be divided into genres  in greek mythology, the nine muses were the goddesses who inspired literature, science, and the arts and who were the source of the knowledge embodied in the poetry, song-lyrics, and myths in the greek culture. according to the online etymological dictionary, the term ""music"" is derived from ""mid-13c., musike, from old french musique  source of spanish m0th century, such as john cage, morton feldman, and witold lutosawski. a more commonly known example of chance-based music is the sound of wind chimes jingling in a breeze.the study of composition has traditionally been dominated by examination of methods and practice of western classical music, but the definition of composition is broad enough to include the creation of popular music and traditional music songs and instrumental pieces as well as spontaneously improvised works like those of free jazz performers and african percussionists such as ewe drummers.in the 2000s, music notation typically means the written expression of music notes and rhythms on paper using symbols. when music is written down, the pitches and rhythm of the music, such as the notes of a melody, are notated. music notation also often provides instructions on how to perform the music. for example, the sheet music for a song may state that the song is a ""slow blues"" or a ""fast swing"", which indicates the tempo and the genre.  to read music notation, a person must have an understanding of music theory, harmony and the performance practice associated with a particular song or pieces genre.written notation varies with style and period of music. in the 2000s, notated music is produced as sheet music or, for individuals with computer scorewriter programs, as an image on a computer screen. in ancient times, music notation was put onto stone or clay tablets. to perform music from notation, a singer or instrumentalist requires an understanding of the rhythmic and pitch elements embodied in the symbols and the performance practice that is associated with a piece of music or a genre. in genres requiring musical improvisation, the performer often plays from music where only the chord changes and form of the song are written, requiring the performer to have a great understanding of the musics structure, harmony and the styles of a particular genre  people who study these properties are known as music theorists, and they typically work as professors in colleges, universities, and music conservatories. some have applied acoustics, human physiology, and psychology to the explanation of how and why music is perceived. music theorists publish their research in music theory journals and university press books.music has many different fundamentals or elements. depending on the definition of ""element"" being used, these can include: pitch, beat or pulse, tempo, rhythm, melody, harmony, texture, style, allocation of voices, timbre or color, dynamics, expression, articulation, form and structure. the elements of music feature prominently in the music curriculums of australia, uk and us. all three curriculums identify pitch, dynamics, timbre and texture as elements, but the other identified elements of music are far from universally agreed. below is a list of the three official versions of the ""elements of music"":in relation to the uk curriculum, in 2013 the term: ""appropriate musical notations"" was added to their list of elements and the title of the list was changed from the ""elements of music"" to the ""inter-related dimensions of music"". the inter-related dimensions of music are listed as: pitch, duration, dynamics, tempo, timbre, texture, structure and appropriate musical notations.the phrase ""the elements of music"" is used in a number of different contexts. the two most common contexts can be differentiated by describing them as the ""rudimentary elements of music"" and the ""perceptual elements of music"".in the 1800s, the phrases ""the elements of music"" and ""the rudiments of music"" were used interchangeably.  the elements described in these documents refer to aspects of music that are needed in order to become a musician, recent writers such as espie estrella seem to be using the phrase ""elements of music"" in a similar manner. a definition which most accurately reflects this usage is: ""the rudimentary principles of an art, science, etc.: the elements of grammar."" the uks curriculum switch to the ""inter-related dimensions of music"" seems to be a move back to using the rudimentary elements of music.since the emergence of the study of psychoacoustics in the 1930s, most lists of elements of music have related more to how we hear music than how we learn to play it or study it. c.e. seashore, in his book psychology of music, identified four ""psychological attributes of sound"". these were: ""pitch, loudness, time, and timbre""  and educational institutions lists of elements generally align with this definition as well.although writers of lists of ""rudimentary elements of music"" can vary their lists depending on their personal  and then to define the ""elements of music"" as: sound, structure, and artistic intent.pitch is an aspect of a sound that we can hear, reflecting whether one musical sound, note or tone is ""higher"" or ""lower"" than another musical sound, note or tone. we can talk about the highness or lowness of pitch in the more general sense, such as the way a listener hears a piercingly high piccolo note or whistling tone as higher in pitch than a deep thump of a bass drum. we also talk about pitch in the precise sense associated with musical melodies, basslines and chords. precise pitch can only be determined in sounds that have a frequency that is clear and stable enough to distinguish from noise. for example, it is much easier for listeners to discern the pitch of a single note played on a piano  than to try to discern the pitch of a crash cymbal that is struck.a melody  timbre is what makes a particular musical sound different from another, even when they have the same pitch and loudness. for example, a 4400th century, tin pan alley songs and broadway musical songs were often in aaba 32 bar form, in which the a sections repeated the same eight bar melody in the tenth edition of the oxford companion to music, percy scholes defines musical form as ""a series of strategies designed to find a successful mean between the opposite extremes of unrelieved repetition and unrelieved alteration."" examples of common forms of western music include the fugue, the invention, sonata-allegro, canon, strophic, theme and variations, and rondo.scholes states that european classical music had only six stand-alone forms: simple binary, simple ternary, compound binary, rondo, air with variations, and fugue where a piece cannot readily be broken down into sectional units  professor charles keil classified forms and formal detail as ""sectional, developmental, or variational.""some styles of music place an emphasis on certain of these fundamentals, while others place less emphasis on certain elements. to give one example, while bebop-era jazz makes use of very complex chords, including altered dominants and challenging chord progressions, with chords changing two or more times per bar and keys changing several times in a tune, funk places most of its emphasis on rhythm and groove, with entire songs based around a vamp on a single chord. while romantic era classical music from the mid- to late-1800s makes great use of dramatic changes of dynamics, from whispering pianissimo sections to thunderous fortissimo sections, some entire baroque dance suites for harpsichord from the early 1700s may use a single dynamic. to give another example, while some art music pieces, such as symphonies are very long, some pop songs are just a few minutes long.prehistoric music can only be theorized based on findings from paleolithic archaeology sites. flutes are often discovered, carved from bones in which lateral holes have been pierced; these are thought to have been blown at one end like the japanese shakuhachi. the divje babe flute, carved from a cave bear femur, is thought to be at least 40,000 years old. instruments such as the seven-holed flute and various types of stringed instruments, such as the ravanahatha, have been recovered from the indus valley civilization archaeological sites. india has one of the oldest musical traditions in the world1 indicated that jubal is the ""father of all such as handle the harp and pipe"", the pentateuch is nearly silent about the practice and instruction of music in the early life of israel"". in i samuel 10, there are more depictions of ""large choirs and orchestras"". these large ensembles could only be run with extensive rehearsals. this had led some scholars to theorize that the prophet samuel led a public music school to a wide range of students.music was an important part of social and cultural life in ancient greece. musicians and singers played a prominent role in greek theater. mixed-gender choruses performed for entertainment, celebration, and spiritual ceremonies. instruments included the double-reed aulos and a plucked string instrument, the lyre, principally the special kind called a kithara. music was an important part of education, and boys were taught music starting at age six. greek musical literacy created a flowering of music development. greek music theory included the greek musical modes, that eventually became the basis for western religious and classical music. later, influences from the roman empire, eastern europe, and the byzantine empire changed greek music. the seikilos epitaph is the oldest surviving example of a complete musical composition, including musical notation, from anywhere in the world. the oldest surviving work written on the subject of music theory is harmonika stoicheia by aristoxenus.the medieval era  the late baroque style was polyphonically complex and richly ornamented. important composers from the baroque era include johann sebastian bach  where a prominent melody and a subordinate chordal accompaniment part are clearly distinct. classical instrumental melodies tended to be almost voicelike and singable. new genres were developed, and the fortepiano, the forerunner to the modern piano, replaced the baroque era harpsichord and pipe organ as the main keyboard instrument in the years after 1800, the music developed by ludwig van beethoven and franz schubert introduced a more dramatic, expressive style. in beethovens case, short motifs, developed organically, came to replace melody as the most significant compositional unit in the 19th century, one of the key ways that new compositions became known to the public was by the sales of sheet music, which middle class amateur music lovers would perform at home on their piano or other common instruments, such as violin. with 20th-century music, the invention of new electric technologies such as radio broadcasting and the mass market availability of gramophone records meant that sound recordings of songs and pieces heard by listeners  and musique concr0th century, and during the second half of that century, rock music did the same. jazz is an american musical artform that originated in the beginning of the 20th century in african american communities in the southern united states from a confluence of african and european music traditions. the styles west african pedigree is evident in its use of blue notes, improvisation, polyrhythms, syncopation, and the swung note.rock music is a genre of popular music that developed in the 1960s from 1950s rock and roll, rockabilly, blues, and country music. the sound of rock often revolves around the electric guitar or acoustic guitar, and it uses a strong back beat laid down by a rhythm section. along with the guitar or keyboards, saxophone and blues-style harmonica are used as soloing instruments. in its ""purest form"", it ""has three chords, a strong, insistent back beat, and a catchy melody"". the traditional rhythm section for popular music is rhythm guitar, electric bass guitar, drums. some bands also have keyboard instruments such as organ, piano, or, since the 1970s, analog synthesizers. in the 1980s, pop musicians began using digital synthesizers, such as the dx-7 synthesizer, electronic drum machines such as the tr-808 and synth bass devices in the 20th century, important contributions were made by peter kivy, jerrold levinson, roger scruton, and stephen davies. however, many musicians, music critics, and other non-philosophers have contributed to the aesthetics of music. in the 19th century, a significant debate arose between eduard hanslick, a music critic and musicologist, and composer richard wagner regarding whether music can express meaning. harry partch and some other musicologists, such as kyle gann, have studied and tried to popularize microtonal music and the usage of alternate musical scales. also many modern composers like la monte young, rhys chatham and glenn branca paid much attention to a scale called just intonation.it is often thought that music has the ability to affect our emotions, intellect, and psychology; it can assuage our loneliness or incite our passions. the philosopher plato suggests in the republic that music has a direct effect on the soul. therefore, he proposes that in the ideal regime music would be closely regulated by the state there has been a strong tendency in the aesthetics of music to emphasize the paramount importance of compositional structure; however, other issues concerning the aesthetics of music include lyricism, harmony, hypnotism, emotiveness, temporal dynamics, resonance, playfulness, and color modern music psychology aims to explain and understand musical behavior and experience. research in this field and its subfields are primarily empirical; their knowledge tends to advance on the basis of interpretations of data collected by systematic observation of and interaction with human participants. in addition to its focus on fundamental perceptions and cognitive processes, music psychology is a field of research with practical relevance for many areas, including music performance, composition, education, criticism, and therapy, as well as investigations of human aptitude, skill, intelligence, creativity, and social behavior.cognitive neuroscience of music is the scientific study of brain-based mechanisms involved in the cognitive processes underlying music. these behaviours include music listening, performing, composing, reading, writing, and ancillary activities. it also is increasingly concerned with the brain basis for musical aesthetics and musical emotion. the field is distinguished by its reliance on direct observations of the brain, using such techniques as functional magnetic resonance imaging  the use of computer models provides an exacting, interactive medium in which to formulate and test theories and has roots in artificial intelligence and cognitive science.this interdisciplinary field investigates topics such as the parallels between language and music in the brain. biologically inspired models of computation are often included in research, such as neural networks and evolutionary programs. this field seeks to model how musical knowledge is represented, stored, perceived, performed, and generated. by using a well-structured computer environment, the systematic structures of these cognitive phenomena can be investigated.psychoacoustics is the scientific study of sound perception. more specifically, it is the branch of science studying the psychological and physiological responses associated with sound  it seeks to understand music perception and activity in the context of evolutionary theory. charles darwin speculated that music may have held an adaptive advantage and functioned as a protolanguage, a view which has spawned several competing theories of music evolution. an alternate view sees music as a by-product of linguistic evolution; a type of ""auditory cheesecake"" that pleases the senses without providing any adaptive function. this view has been directly countered by numerous music researchers.an individuals culture or ethnicity plays a role in their music cognition, including their preferences, emotional reaction, and musical memory. musical preferences are biased toward culturally familiar musical traditions beginning in infancy, and adults classification of the emotion of a musical piece depends on both culturally specific and universal structural features. additionally, individuals musical memory abilities are greater for culturally familiar music than for culturally unfamiliar music.many ethnographic studies demonstrate that music is a participatory, community-based activity. music is experienced by individuals in a range of social settings ranging from being alone to attending a large concert, forming a music community, which cannot be understood as a function of individual will or accident; it includes both commercial and non-commercial participants with a shared set of common values. musical performances take different forms in different cultures and socioeconomic milieus. in europe and north america, there is often a divide between what types of music are viewed as a ""high culture"" and ""low culture."" ""high culture"" types of music typically include western art music such as baroque, classical, romantic, and modern-era symphonies, concertos, and solo works, and are typically heard in formal concerts in concert halls and churches, with the audience sitting quietly in seats.other types of music0th century, the division between ""high"" and ""low"" musical forms was widely accepted as a valid distinction that separated out better quality, more advanced ""art music"" from the popular styles of music heard in bars and dance halls.however, in the 1980s and 1990s, musicologists studying this perceived divide between ""high"" and ""low"" musical genres argued that this distinction is not based on the musical value or quality of the different types of music. rather, they argued that this distinction was based largely on the socioeconomics standing or social class of the performers or audience of the different types of music. for example, whereas the audience for classical symphony concerts typically have above-average incomes, the audience for a rap concert in an inner-city area may have below-average incomes. even though the performers, audience, or venue where non-""art"" music is performed may have a lower socioeconomic status, the music that is performed, such as blues, rap, punk, funk, or ska may be very complex and sophisticated.when composers introduce styles of music that break with convention, there can be a strong resistance from academic music experts and popular culture. late-period beethoven string quartets, stravinsky ballet scores, serialism, bebop-era jazz, hip hop, punk rock, and electronica have all been considered non-music by some critics when they were first introduced. such themes are examined in the sociology of music. the sociological study of music, sometimes called sociomusicology, is often pursued in departments of sociology, media studies, or music, and is closely related to the field of ethnomusicology.women have played a major role in music throughout history, as composers, songwriters, instrumental performers, singers, conductors, music scholars, music educators, music critics/music journalists and other musical professions. as well, it describes music movements, events and genres related to women, womens issues and feminism. in the 2010s, while women comprise a significant proportion of popular music and classical music singers, and a significant proportion of songwriters  in the 1960s pop-music scene, ""ike most aspects of the...music business,  songwriting was a male-dominated field. though there were plenty of female singers on the radio, women ...were primarily seen as consumers:... singing was sometimes an acceptable pastime for a girl, but playing an instrument, writing songs, or producing records simply wasnt done."" young women ""...were not socialized to see themselves as people who create .""women are also underrepresented in orchestral conducting, music criticism/music journalism, music producing, and sound engineering. while women were discouraged from composing in the 19th century, and there are few women musicologists, women became involved in music education ""...to such a degree that women dominated  during the later half of the 19th century and well into the 20th century.""according to jessica duchen, a music writer for londons the independent, women musicians in classical music are ""...too often judged for their appearances, rather than their talent"" and they face pressure ""...to look sexy onstage and in photos."" duchen states that while ""here are women musicians who refuse to play on their looks,...the ones who do tend to be more materially successful.""according to the uks radio 3 editor, edwina wolstencroft, the music industry has long been open to having women in performance or entertainment roles, but women are much less likely to have positions of authority, such as being the leader of an orchestra. in popular music, while there are many women singers recording songs, there are very few women behind the audio console acting as music producers, the individuals who direct and manage the recording process. one of the most recorded artists is asha bhosle, an indian singer best known as a playback singer in hindi cinema.the music that composers and songwriters make can be heard through several media; the most traditional way is to hear it live, in the presence of the musicians  during the 1920s, live musical performances by orchestras, pianists, and theater organists were common at first-run theaters. with the coming of the talking motion pictures, those featured performances were largely eliminated. the american federation of musicians since legislation introduced to help protect performers, composers, publishers and producers, including the audio home recording act of 1992 in the united states, and the 1979 revised berne convention for the protection of literary and artistic works in the united kingdom, recordings and live performances have also become more accessible through computers, devices and internet in a form that is commonly known as music-on-demand.in many cultures, there is less distinction between performing and listening to music, since virtually everyone is involved in some sort of musical activity, often in a communal setting. in industrialized countries, listening to music through a recorded form, such as sound recording on record or radio became more common than experiencing live performance, roughly in the middle of the 20th century. by the 1980s, watching music videos was a popular way to listen to music, while also seeing the performers.sometimes, live performances incorporate prerecorded sounds. for example, a disc jockey uses disc records for scratching, and some 20th-century works have a solo for an instrument or voice that is performed along with music that is prerecorded onto a tape. some pop bands use recorded backing tracks. computers and many keyboards can be programmed to produce and play musical instrument digital interface another effect of the internet arose with online communities and social media websites like youtube and facebook, a social networking service. these sites make it easier for aspiring singers and amateur bands to distribute videos of their songs, connect with other musicians, and gain audience interest. professional musicians also use youtube as a free publisher of promotional material. youtube users, for example, no longer only download and listen to mp3s, but also actively create their own. according to don tapscott and anthony d. williams, in their book wikinomics, there has been a shift from a traditional consumer role to what they call a ""prosumer"" role, a consumer who both creates content and consumes. manifestations of this in music include the production of mashes, remixes, and music videos by fans.the music industry refers to the businesses connected with the creation and sale of music. it consists of songwriters and composers who create new songs and musical pieces, music producers and sound engineers who record songs and pieces, record labels and publishers that distribute recorded music products and sheet music internationally and that often control the rights to those products. some music labels are ""independent,"" while others are subsidiaries of larger corporate entities or international media groups. in the 2000s, the increasing popularity of listening to music as digital music files on mp3 players, ipods, or computers, and of trading music on file sharing websites or buying it online in the form of digital files had a major impact on the traditional music business. many smaller independent cd stores went out of business as music buyers decreased their purchases of cds, and many labels had lower cd sales. some companies did well with the change to a digital format, though, such as apples itunes, an online music store that sells digital files of songs over the internet.in spite of some international copyright treaties, determining which music is in the public domain is complicated by the variety of national copyright laws that may be applicable.  us copyright law formerly protected printed music published after 1923 for 28 years and with renewal for another 28 years, but the copyright act of 1976 made renewal automatic, and the digital millennium copyright act changed the calculation of the copyright term to 70 years after the death of the creator. recorded sound falls under mechanical licensing, often covered by a confusing patchwork of state laws; most cover versions are licensed through the harry fox agency. performance rights may be obtained by either performers or the performance venue; the two major organizations for licensing are bmi and ascap. two online sources for public domain music are imslp  in elementary schools, children often learn to play instruments such as the recorder, sing in small choirs, and learn about the history of western art music and traditional music. some elementary school children also learn about popular music styles. in religious schools, children sing hymns and other religious music. in secondary schools  music has long been used to help people deal with their emotions. in the 17th century, the scholar robert burtons the anatomy of melancholy argued that music and dance were critical in treating mental illness, especially melancholia. he noted that music has an ""excellent power ...to expel many other diseases"" and he called it ""a sovereign remedy against despair and melancholy."" he pointed out that in antiquity, canus, a rhodian fiddler, used music to ""make a melancholy man merry, ...a lover more enamoured, a religious man more devout."" in the ottoman empire, mental illnesses were treated with music. in november 2006, dr. michael j. crawford and his colleagues also found that music therapy helped schizophrenic patients.albert einstein had a lifelong love of music  once stating that life without playing music would be inconceivable to him. in some interviews einstein even attributed much of his scientific intuition to music, with his son hans recounting that ""whenever he felt that he had come to the end of the road or into a difficult situation in his work, he would take refuge in music, and that would usually resolve all his difficulties."" something in the music, according to michele and robert root-bernstein in psychology today, ""would guide his thoughts in new and creative directions."" it has been said that einstein considered mozarts music to reveal a universal harmony that einstein believed existed in the universe, ""as if the great wolfgang amadeus did not create his beautifully clear music at all, but simply discovered it already made. this perspective parallels, remarkably, einstein\x80\x99s views on the ultimate simplicity of nature and its explanation and statement via essentially simple mathematical expressions."" a review suggests that music may be effective for improving subjective sleep quality in adults with insomnia symptoms. music is also being used in clinical rehabilitation of cognitive and motor disorders.",1,0

"the western world, also known as the west, refers to various regions, nations and states, depending on the context, most often consisting of the majority of europe, north america, and australasia. the western world is also known as the occident ancient greece and ancient rome are generally considered to be the birthplaces of western civilization0th centuries, and later exportation of mass culture, much of the rest of the world has been extensively influenced by western culture, in a phenomenon often called westernization.the concept of the western part of the earth has its roots in the theological, methodological and emphatical division between the western roman catholic and eastern orthodox churches. west was originally literal, opposing catholic europe with the cultures and civilizations of orthodox europe, the middle east and north africa, sub-saharan africa, south asia, southeast asia and east asia, which early-modern europeans saw as the east.by the mid-20th century, western culture was exported worldwide through the emergent mass media: film, radio, television and recorded music; and the development and growth of international transport and telecommunication  refers to europe and to areas whose populations have had a large european ethnical presence since the 15th century age of discovery. this is most evident in australias inclusion in modern definitions of the western world: despite being part of the eastern hemisphere; these regions and those like it are included due to its significant british influence deriving from the colonisation of british explorers, and the immigration of europeans in the 20th century which has since grounded the country to the western world politically and culturally.western culture was influenced by many older civilizations of the ancient near east, such as phoenicia, ancient israel, minoan crete, sumer, babylonia, and also ancient egypt. it originated in the mediterranean basin and its vicinity; ancient greece and rome are often cited as its birthplaces.over time, their associated empires grew first to the east and west to include the rest of mediterranean and black sea coastal areas, conquering and absorbing. later, they expanded to the north of the mediterranean sea to include western, central, and southeastern europe. christianization of ireland  contend that western civilization was born around ad 500, after the total collapse of the western roman empire, leaving a vacuum for new ideas to flourish that were impossible in classical societies. in either view, between the fall of the western roman empire and the renaissance, the west  and then readaptation, reorientation and considerable renewed material, technological and political development. this whole period of roughly a millennium is known as the middle ages, its early part forming the ""dark ages"", designations that were created during the renaissance and reflect the perspective on history, and the self-image, of the latter period.the knowledge of the ancient western world was partly preserved during this period due to the survival of the eastern roman empire and the introduction of the catholic church; it was also greatly expanded by the arab importation of both the ancient greco-roman and new technology through the arabs from india and china to europe.since the renaissance, the west evolved beyond the influence of the ancient greeks and romans and the islamic world, due to the successful second agricultural, commercial, scientific, and industrial revolutions   numerous times, this expansion was accompanied by catholic missionaries, who attempted to proselytize christianity.there is debate among some as to whether latin america as a whole is in a category of its own. whether russia should be categorized as ""east"" or ""west"" has been ""an ongoing discussion"" for centuries.the term ""western culture"" is used very broadly to refer to a heritage of social norms, ethical values, traditional customs, religious beliefs, political systems, and specific artifacts and technologies.specifically, western culture may imply:the concept of western culture is generally linked to the classical definition of the western world. in this definition, western culture is the set of literary, scientific, political, artistic, and philosophical principles that set it apart from other civilizations. much of this set of traditions and knowledge is collected in the western canon.the term has come to apply to countries whose history is strongly marked by european immigration or settlement, such as the americas, and oceania, and is not restricted to europe.some tendencies that define modern western societies are the existence of political pluralism, secularism, generalization of middle class, prominent subcultures or countercultures the geopolitical divisions in europe that created a concept of east and west originated in the ancient tyrannical and imperialistic graeco-roman times. the eastern mediterranean was home to the highly urbanized cultures that had greek as their common language roman catholic western and central europe, as such, maintained a distinct identity particularly as it began to redevelop during the renaissance. even following the protestant reformation, protestant europe continued to see itself as more tied to roman catholic europe than other parts of the perceived civilized world.use of the term west as a specific cultural and geopolitical term developed over the course of the age of exploration as europe spread its culture to other parts of the world. roman catholics were the first major religious group to immigrate to the new world, as settlers in the colonies of spain and portugal ancient greek civilization had been growing in the first millennium bc into wealthy poleis, so-called city-states  such as athens, sparta, thebes, and corinth, by middle and near eastern ones the then hellenic division between the barbarians  the greeks would highlight the lack of freedom in the persian world, something that they viewed as antithetical to their culture.the terms ""west"" and ""east"" were not used by any greek author to describe that conflict. the anachronistic application of those terms to that division entails a stark logical contradiction, given that the term ""west"" has been used to distinguish latin-speaking peoples from their greek-speaking neighbors.greek culture is said to have influenced roman civilization in all aspects of society, from architecture to philosophy, art and war.according to a few writers, the future conquest of parts of the roman empire by germanic peoples and the subsequent dominance by the western christian papacy  including christian greek thought.ancient rome the roman empire succeeded the approximately 500-year-old roman republic  of the first triumvirate and later those of the second triumvirate. in 350 years, from the successful and deadliest war with the phoenicians began in 218 bc to the rule of emperor hadrian by ad 117, ancient rome expanded up to twenty-five times its area. the same time passed before its fall in ad 476. rome had expanded long before the empire reached its zenith with the conquest of dacia in ad 106, under emperor trajan. during its territorial peak, the roman empire controlled about 5,000,000 square kilometres in ad 395, a few decades before its western collapse, the roman empire formally split into a western and an eastern one, each with their own emperors, capitals, and governments, although ostensibly they still belonged to one formal empire. the western roman empire provinces eventually were replaced by northern european germanic ruled kingdoms in the 5th century due to civil wars, corruption, and devastating germanic invasions from such tribes as the goths, the franks and the vandals by their late expansion throughout europe. the three-day visigothss ad 410 sack of rome who had been raiding greece not long before, a shocking time for graeco-romans, was the first time after almost 800 years that rome had fallen to a foreign enemy, and st. jerome, living in bethlehem at the time, wrote that ""the city which had taken the whole world was itself taken."" there followed the sack of ad 455 lasting 14 days, this time conducted by the vandals, retaining romes eternal spirit through the holy see of rome  the ancient barbarian tribes, often composed of well-trained roman soldiers paid by rome to guard the extensive borders, had become militarily sophisticated romanized barbarians, and mercilessly slaughtered the romans conquering their western territories while looting their possessions.the roman empire is where the idea of ""the west"" began to emerge. by romes central location at the heart of the empire, ""west"" and ""east"" were terms used to denote provinces west and east of the capital itself. therefore, iberia the dissolution of the western half the eastern roman empire, governed from constantinople, is usually referred to as the byzantine empire after ad 476, the traditional date for the ""fall of the western roman empire"" and beginning of the early middle ages. the eastern roman empire surviving the fall of the western protected roman legal and cultural traditions, combining them with greek and christian elements, for another thousand years.  the name byzantine empire was used after the byzantine empire ended, the inhabitants calling themselves romans since the term 04, capital of the greek christian-controlled byzantine empire, described as one of the most profitable and disgraceful sacks of a city in history. this paved the way for muslim conquests in present-day turkey and the balkans in the coming centuries  the geographical identity of the balkans is historically known as a crossroads of cultures, a juncture between the latin and greek bodies of the roman empire, the destination of a massive influx of pagans  as well as the meeting point between islam and christianity. the papal inquisition was established in ad 1229 on a permanent basis, run largely by clergymen in rome, and abolished six centuries later. before ad 1100, the catholic church suppressed what they believed to be heresy, usually through a system of ecclesiastical proscription or imprisonment, but without using torture, and seldom resorting to executions.this very profitable central european fourth crusade had prompted the 14th century renaissance both these religious wars ended with the peace of westphalia ibrahim muteferrika, rational basis for the politics of nations later concepts of a world of nation-states born by the peace of westphalia in 1648, coupled with the ideologies of the enlightenment, the coming of modernity, the scientific revolution and the industrial revolution, would produce powerful social transformations, political and economic institutions that have come to influence this process of influence  and competing spanish navigators. it continued with the rise of the dutch east india company by the destabilising spanish discovery of the new world, and the creation and expansion of the english and french colonial empires, and others.due to the reach of these empires, western institutions expanded throughout the world. even after demands for self-determination from subject peoples within western empires were met with decolonization, these institutions persisted. one specific example was the requirement that post-colonial societies were made to form nation-states with the discovery of the american continent or new world in 1492 european colonialism expanded across the globe with the exploring voyage of merchant, navigator, and hispano-italian colonizer christopher columbus. such voyages were influenced by medieval european adventurers after the european spice trade with asia, who had journeyed overland to the far east contributing to geographical knowledge of parts of the asian continent. they are of enormous significance in western history as they marked the beginning of the european exploration, colonization and exploitation of the american continents and their native inhabitants. the european colonization of the americas led to the atlantic slave trade between the 1490s and the 1800s, which also contributed to the development of african intertribal warfare and racist ideology. before the abolition of its slave trade in 1807, the british empire alone  the holy roman empire was dissolved in 1806 by the french revolutionary wars; abolition of the roman catholic inquisition followed.in the early-19th century, the systematic urbanisation process  also, the new philosophical movement later known as romanticism originated, in the wake of the previous age of reason of the 1600s and the enlightenment of 1700s. these are seen as fostering the 19th century western worlds sustained economic development.parliament building, portugal  industrialisation, however, dramatically increased european demand for asian raw materials; and the severe long depression of the 1870s provoked a scramble for new markets for european industrial products and financial services in africa, the americas, eastern europe, and especially in asia  this resulted in the so-called ""new imperialism"", which saw a shift in focus from trade and indirect rule to formal colonial control of vast overseas territories ruled as political extensions of their mother countries. the later years of the 19th century saw the transition from ""informal imperialism""  by military influence and economic dominance, to direct rule between the 1870s and 1914  and by 1920, it covered 35,500,000  24% of the earths total land area. at its apex, the phrase ""the empire on which the sun never sets"" described the british empire, because its expanse around the globe meant that the sun always shone on at least one of its territories. as a result, its political, legal, linguistic and cultural legacy is widespread throughout the western world.in the aftermath of the second world war, decolonizing efforts were employed by all western powers under united nations most of colonized nations received independence by 1960. great britain showed ongoing responsibility for the welfare of its former colonies as member states of the commonwealth of nations. but the end of western colonial imperialism saw the rise of westrern neocolonialism or economic imperialism. multinational corporations came to offer ""a dramatic refinement of the traditional business enterprise"", through ""issues as far ranging as national sovereignty, ownership of the means of production, environmental protection, consumerism, and policies toward organized labor."" though the overt colonial era had passed, western nations, as comparatively rich, well-armed, and culturally powerful states, wielded a large degree of influence throughout the world, and with little or no sense of responsibility toward the peoples impacted by its multinational corporations in their exploitation of minerals and markets. the dictum of alfred thayer mahan is shown to have lasting relevance, that whoever controls the seas controls the world.during the cold war, a new definition emerged. earth was divided into three ""worlds"". the first world, analogous in this context to what was called the west, was composed of nato members and other countries aligned with the united states. the second world was the eastern bloc in the soviet sphere of influence, including the soviet union the third world consisted of countries, many of which were unaligned with either, and important members included india, yugoslavia, finland in a debated cold war ii, a new definition emerged inside the realm of western journalism. more specifically, cold war ii, also known as the second cold war, new cold war, cold war redux, cold war 2.0, and colder war, refers to the tensions, hostilities, and political rivalry that intensified dramatically in 2014 between the russian federation on the one hand, and the united states, european union, nato and some other countries on the other hand. tensions escalated in 2014 after russias annexation of crimea, military intervention in ukraine, and the 2015 russian military intervention in the syrian civil war. by august 2014, both sides had implemented economic, financial, and diplomatic sanctions upon each other: virtually all western countries, led by the us and eu, imposed restrictive measures on russia; the latter reciprocally introduced retaliatory measures.the exact scope of the western world is somewhat subjective in nature, depending on whether cultural, economic, spiritual or political criteria are employed. it is a generally accepted western view to recognize the existence of at least three ""major worlds"" many anthropologists, sociologists and historians oppose ""the west and the rest"" in a categorical manner. the same has been done by malthusian demographers with a sharp distinction between european and non-european family systems. among anthropologists, this includes durkheim, dumont and l0th century, christianity declined in influence in many western countries, mostly in the european union where some member states have experienced falling church attendance and membership in recent years, and also elsewhere. secularism  and most westerners nominally identify themselves as christians christianity remains the dominant religion in the western world, where 70% are christians. a 2011 pew research center survey found that 76.2% of europeans, 73.3% in oceania, and about 86.0% in the americas  the philippines is in a unique situation where although; except for the very significant minority, the majority population is little to no european base, the culture is very western based. from traditional architecture, fashion, music, cuisine and christian religion. the philippines is in itself a spanish creation.western world countries also are the most keen on digital and televisual media technologies, as they were in the postwar period on television and radio: from 2000 to 2014, internets market penetration in the west was twice that in non-western regions. wikipedia is blocked intermittently in china since 2004.the term ""western world"" is sometimes interchangeably used with the term first world or developed countries, stressing the difference between first world and the third world or developing countries. this usage occurs despite the fact that many countries that may be culturally ""western"" are developing countries 0s tried to westernize the predominantly muslim country with only 3% of its territory within europe. it is his chief example of a ""torn country"" that is attempting to join western civilization. the countrys elite started the westernization efforts, beginning with mustafa kemal atat3, imposed western institutions and dress, removed the arabic alphabet and embraced the latin alphabet. it joined nato and since the 1960s has been seeking to join the european union  with very slow progress. mexico and russia are also considered to be torn by huntington. he also gives the example of australia as a country torn between its western civilizational heritage and its growing economic engagement with asia.a series of scholars of civilization, including arnold j. toynbee, alfred kroeber and carroll quigley have identified and analyzed ""western civilization"" as one of the civilizations that have historically existed and still exist today. toynbee entered into quite an expansive mode, including as candidates those countries or cultures who became so heavily influenced by the west as to adopt these borrowings into their very self-identity. carried to its limit, this would in practice include almost everyone within the west, in one way or another. in particular, toynbee refers to the intelligentsia formed among the educated elite of countries impacted by the european expansion of centuries past. while often pointedly nationalist, these cultural and political leaders interacted within the west to such an extent as to change both themselves and the west.the theologian and paleontologist pierre teilhard de chardin conceived of the west as the set of civilizations descended from the nile valley civilization of egypt.palestinian-american literary critic edward said uses the term occident in his discussion of orientalism. according to his binary, the west, or occident, created a romanticized vision of the east, or orient, to justify colonial and imperialist intentions. this occident-orient binary focuses on the western vision of the east instead of any truths about the east. his theories are rooted in hegels master-slave dialectic: the occident would not exist without the orient and vice versa. further, western writers created this irrational, feminine, weak ""other"" to contrast with the rational, masculine, strong west because of a need to create a difference between the two that would justify imperialist ambitions, according to the said-influenced indian-american theorist homi k. bhabha.division of the roman empire after 395 into western and eastern part. the geopolitical divisions in europe that created a concept of east and west originated in the roman empire.latin alphabet world distribution. the dark green areas show

"coordinates: 414036.92667.92667yale university is a private ivy league research university in new haven, connecticut. founded in 1701 as the collegiate school, it is the third-oldest institution of higher education in the united states and one of the nine colonial colleges chartered before the american revolution. collegiate school was renamed yale college in 1718 to honor the schools largest benefactor, elihu yale.chartered by connecticut colony, the collegiate school was established in 1701 by clergy to educate congregational ministers. it moved to new haven in 1716 and shortly after was renamed yale college in recognition of a gift from east india company governor elihu yale. originally restricted to theology and sacred languages, the curriculum began to incorporate humanities and sciences by the time of the american revolution. in the 19th century, the college expanded into graduate and professional instruction, awarding the first phd in the united states in 1861 and organizing as a university in 1887. yales faculty and student populations grew after 1890 with rapid expansion of the physical campus and scientific research.yale is organized into fourteen constituent schools: the original undergraduate college, the yale graduate school of arts and sciences and twelve professional schools. while the university is governed by the yale corporation, each schools faculty oversees its curriculum and degree programs. in addition to a central campus in downtown new haven, the university owns athletic facilities in western new haven, a campus in west haven, connecticut and forests and nature preserves throughout new england. the universitys assets include an endowment valued at $30.3019, the second largest endowment of any educational institution in north america. the yale university library, serving all constituent schools, holds more than 15,000 of which are offered annually. students compete intercollegiately as the yale bulldogs in the ncaa division i 020, 65 nobel laureates, 5 fields medalists and 3 turing award winners have been affiliated with yale university. in addition, yale has graduated many notable alumni, including five u.s. presidents, 19 u.s. supreme court justices, 31 living billionaires and many heads of state. hundreds of members of congress and many u.s. diplomats, 78 macarthur fellows, 252 rhodes scholars, 122 marshall scholars, and nine mitchell scholars have been affiliated with the university.yale traces its beginnings to ""an act for liberty to erect a collegiate school"", passed by the general court of the colony of connecticut on october 9, 1701, while meeting in new haven. the act was an effort to create an institution to train ministers and lay leadership for connecticut. soon thereafter, a group of ten congregational ministers, samuel andrew, thomas buckingham, israel chauncy, samuel mather  the group, led by james pierpont, is now known as ""the founders"".originally known as the ""collegiate school"", the institution opened in the home of its first rector, abraham pierson, today considered the first president of yale. pierson lived in killingworth in 1718, at the behest of either rector samuel andrew or the colonys governor gurdon saltonstall, cotton mather contacted the successful boston born businessman elihu yale to ask him for financial help in constructing a new building for the college. through the persuasion of jeremiah dummer, elihu ""eli"" yale, who had made a fortune while working for the east india company overseeing its slave trading activities while living in madras, donated nine bales of goods, which were sold for more than 2 the rector and six of his friends, who had a study group to discuss the new ideas, announced that they had given up calvinism, become arminians and joined the church of england. they were ordained in england and returned to the colonies as missionaries for the anglican faith. thomas clapp became president in 1745 and struggled to return the college to calvinist orthodoxy, but he did not close the library. other students found deist books in the library.yale was swept up by the great intellectual movements of the period8 was a dogmatic defense of the latin and greek curriculum against critics who wanted more courses in modern languages, mathematics, and science. unlike higher education in europe, there was no national curriculum for colleges and universities in the united states. in the competition for students and financial support, college leaders strove to keep current with demands for innovation. at the same time, they realized that a significant portion of their students and prospective students demanded a classical background. the yale report meant the classics would not be abandoned. all institutions experimented with changes in the curriculum, often resulting in a dual-track. in the decentralized environment of higher education in the united states, balancing change with tradition was a common challenge because no one could afford to be completely modern or completely classical. a group of professors at yale and new haven congregationalist ministers articulated a conservative response to the changes brought about by the victorian culture. they concentrated on developing a whole man possessed of religious values sufficiently strong to resist temptations from within, yet flexible enough to adjust to the isms  william graham sumner, professor from 1872 to 1909, taught in the emerging disciplines of economics and sociology to overflowing classrooms. he bested president noah porter, who disliked social science and wanted yale to lock into its traditions of classical education. porter objected to sumners use of a textbook by herbert spencer that espoused agnostic materialism because it might harm students.until 1887, the legal name of the university was ""the president and fellows of yale college, in new haven"". in 1887, under an act passed by the connecticut general assembly, yale gained its current, and shorter, name of ""yale university"".the revolutionary war soldier nathan hale along with harvard and princeton, yale students rejected british concepts about amateurism in sports and constructed athletic programs that were uniquely american, such as football. the harvard, when harvard and yale met in one of the first intercollegiate debates and 1909 in 19095 and 1940, philanthropic foundations, especially ones connected with the rockefellers, contributed about $70 to 1935. dedicated to the new scientific medicine established in germany, he was equally fervent about ""social medicine"" and the study of humans in their culture and environment. he established the ""yale system"" of teaching, with few lectures and fewer exams, and strengthened the full-time faculty system; he also created the graduate-level yale school of nursing and the psychiatry department and built numerous new buildings. progress toward his plans for an institute of

personalities such as a writer, an athlete, a tea-drinking socialite, and a student who has fallen asleep while reading. similarly, the decorative friezes on the buildings depict contemporary scenes such as policemen chasing a robber and arresting a prostitute  deliberately breaking their leaded glass windows and repairing them in the style of the middle ages, and creating niches for decorative statuary but leaving them empty to simulate loss or theft over the ages. in fact, the buildings merely simulate middle ages architecture, for though they appear to be constructed of solid stone blocks in the authentic manner, most actually have steel framing as was commonly used in 1930. one exception is harkness tower, 216 feet  phelps hall, st. anthony hall the oldest building on campus,

first campus police force was founded at yale in 1894, when the university contracted city police officers to exclusively cover the campus. later hired by the university, the officers were originally brought in to quell unrest between students and city residents and curb destructive student behavior. in addition to the yale police department, a variety of safety services are available including blue phones, a safety escort, and 24-hour shuttle service.in the 1970s and 1980s, poverty and violent crime rose in new haven, dampening yales student and faculty recruiting efforts. between 1990 and 2006, new havens crime rate fell by half, helped by a community policing strategy by the new haven police and yales campus became the safest among the ivy league and other peer schools. nonetheless,

departments were part of the new criticism movement. of the new critics, robert penn warren, w.k. wimsatt, and cleanth brooks were all yale faculty. later, the yale comparative literature department became a center of american deconstruction. jacques derrida, the father of deconstruction, taught at the department of comparative literature from the late seventies to mid-1980s. several other yale faculty members were also associated with deconstruction, forming the so-called ""yale school"". these included paul de man who taught in the departments of comparative literature and french, j.,600, with 57% of students coming from the top 10% highest-earning families and 16% from the bottom 60%.yales residential college system was established in 1933 by edward s. harkness, who admired the social intimacy of oxford and cambridge and donated significant funds to found similar colleges at yale and harvard. though yales colleges resemble their english precursors organizationally and architecturally, they are dependent entities of yale college and have limited autonomy. the colleges are led by a head and an academic dean, who reside in the college, and university faculty and affiliates comprise each colleges fellowship. colleges offer their own seminars, social events, and speaking engagements known as ""masters teas,"" but do not contain programs of study or academic departments. all other undergraduate courses are taught by the faculty of arts and sciences and are open to members of any college.all undergraduates are members of a college, to which they are assigned before their freshman year, and 85 percent live in the college quadrangle or a college-affiliated dormitory. while the majority of upperclassman live in the colleges, most on-campus freshmen live on the old campus, the universitys oldest precinct.while harkness original colleges were georgian revival or collegiate gothic in style, two colleges constructed in the 1960s, morse and ezra stiles colleges, have modernist designs. all twelve college quadrangles are organized around a courtyard, and each has a dining hall, courtyard, library, common room, and a range of student facilities. the twelve colleges are named for important alumni or significant places in university history. in 2017, the university opened two new colleges near science hill.jonathan edwards college

john c. calhouns white supremacist beliefs and pro-slavery leadership had prompted calls to rename the college or remove its tributes to calhoun. the racially motivated church shooting in charleston, south carolina, led to renewed calls in the summer of 2015 for calhoun college, one of 12 residential colleges, to be renamed. in july 2015 students signed a petition calling for the name change. they argued in the petition that015 yale president peter salovey addressed the freshman class of 2019 in which he responded to the racial tensions but explained why the college would not be renamed. he described calhoun as ""a notable political theorist, a vice president to two different u.s. presidents, a secretary of war and of state, and a congressman and senator representing south carolina"". he acknowledged that calhoun also ""believed that the highest forms of civilization depend on involuntary servitude. not only that, but he also believed that the races he thought to be inferior, black people in particular, ought to be subjected to it for the sake of their own best interests."" student activism about this issue increased in the fall of 2015, and included further protests sparked by controversy surrounding an administrators comments on the potential positive and negative implications of students who wear halloween costumes that are culturally sensitive. campus-wide discussions expanded to include critical discussion of the experiences of women of color on campus, and the realities of racism in undergraduate life. the protests were sensationalized by the media and led to the labelling of some students as being members of generation snowflake.in april 2016 salovey announced that ""despite decades of vigorous alumni and student protests,"" calhouns name will remain on the yale residential college explaining that it is preferable for yale students to live in calhouns ""shadow"" so they will be ""better prepared to rise to the challenges of the present and the future"". he claimed that if they removed calhouns name, it would ""obscure"" his ""legacy of slavery rather than addressing it"". ""yale is part of that history"" and ""we cannot erase american history, but we can confront it, teach it and learn from it."" one change that will be issued is the title of ""master"" for faculty members who serve as residential college leaders will be renamed to ""head of college"" due to its connotation of slavery.despite this apparently conclusive reasoning, salovey announced that calhoun college would be renamed for groundbreaking computer scientist grace murray hopper in february 2017. this renaming decision received a range of responses from yale students and alumni.in 2014, yale had 385 registered student organizations, plus an additional one hundred groups in the process of registration.the university hosts a variety of student journals, magazines, and newspapers. established in 1872, the yale record is the worlds oldest humor magazine. newspapers include the yale daily news, which was first published in 1878, and the weekly yale herald, which was first published in 1986. the yale journal of medicine & law is a biannual magazine that explores the intersection of law and medicine.dwight hall, an independent, non-profit community service organization, oversees more than 2,000 yale undergraduates working on more than 70 community service initiatives in new haven. the yale college council runs several agencies that oversee campus wide activities and student services. the yale dramatic association and bulldog productions cater to the theater and film communities, respectively. in addition, the yale drama coalition serves to coordinate between and provide resources for the various sudler fund sponsored theater productions which run each weekend. wybc yale radio is the campuss radio station, owned and operated by students. while students used to broadcast on am and fm frequencies, they now have an internet-only stream.the yale college council  the graduate and professional student senate the elizabethan club, a social club, has a membership of undergraduates, graduates, faculty and staff with literary or artistic interests. membership is by invitation. members and their guests may enter the ""lizzies"" premises for conversation and tea. the club owns first editions of a shakespeare folio, several shakespeare quartos, and a first edition of miltons paradise lost, among other important literary texts.yale seniors at graduation smash clay pipes underfoot to symbolize passage from their ""bright college years,"" though in recent history the pipes have been replaced with ""bubble pipes"".  in the second half of the 20th century bladderball, a campus-wide game played with a large inflatable ball, became a popular tradition but was banned by administration due to safety concerns. in spite of administration opposition, students revived the game in 2009, 2011, and 2014, but its future remains uncertain.yale supports 35 varsity athletic teams that compete in the ivy league conference, the eastern college athletic conference, the new england intercollegiate sailing association. yale athletic teams compete intercollegiately at the ncaa division018, the mens lacrosse team defeated the duke blue devils to claim their first ever ncaa division i mens lacrosse championship, and are the first ivy league school to win the title since the princeton tigers in 2001.in 2016, the mens basketball team won the ivy league championship title for the first time in 54 years, earning a spot in the ncaa mens division i basketball tournament. in the first round of the tournament, the bulldogs beat the baylor bears 791, 2000, marked the dedication of yales fourth new boathouse in 1574 and 1956. the yale corinthian yacht club, founded in 1881, is the oldest collegiate sailing club in the world.in 1896, yale and johns hopkins played the first known ice hockey game in the united states. since 2006, the schools ice hockey clubs have played a commemorative game.for kicks, between 1954 and 1982, residential college teams and student organizations played bladderball.yale students claim to have invented frisbee, by tossing empty frisbie pie company tins.yale athletics are supported by the yale precision marching band.

"a community is a social unit  although communities are usually small relative to personal social ties, ""community"" may also refer to large group affiliations such as national communities, international communities, and virtual communities.the english-language word ""community"" derives from the old french comunet001 found those involved in entertainment, professional, and sports virtual groups focused their activities on obtaining information.an epidemic of bullying and harassment has arisen from the exchange of information between strangers, especially among teenagers, in virtual communities. despite attempts to implement anti-bullying policies, sheri bauman, professor of counselling at the university of arizona, claims the ""most effective strategies to prevent bullying"" may cost companies revenue.",1,0
"friendship is a relationship of mutual affection between people. it is a stronger form of interpersonal bond than an association, and has been studied in academic fields such as communication, sociology, social psychology, anthropology, and philosophy. various academic theories of friendship have been proposed, including social exchange theory, equity theory, relational dialectics, and attachment styles.although there are many forms of friendship, some of which may vary from place to place, certain characteristics are present in many types of such bonds. such characteristics include affection; kindness, love, virtue, sympathy, empathy, honesty, altruism, loyalty, generosity, forgiveness, mutual understanding and compassion, enjoyment of each others company, trust, and the ability to be oneself, express ones feelings to others, and make mistakes without fear of judgment from the friend. friendship is an essential aspect of relationship building skills.the understanding of friendship in children tends to be more heavily focused on areas such as common activities, physical proximity, and shared expectations.:498 these friendships provide opportunity for playing and practicing self-regulation.:246 most children tend to describe friendship in terms of things like sharing, and children are more likely to share with someone they consider to be a friend.:246 as children mature, they become less individualized and are more aware of others. they gain the ability to empathize with their friends, and enjoy playing in groups. they also experience peer rejection as they move through the middle childhood years. establishing good friendships at a young age helps a child to be better acclimated in society later on in their life.based upon the reports of teachers and mothers, 75% of preschool children had at least one friend. this figure rose to 78% through the fifth grade, as measured by co-nomination as friends, and 55% had a mutual best friend.:247 about 15% of children were found to be chronically friendless, reporting periods without mutual friends at least six months.:250potential benefits of friendship include the opportunity to learn about empathy and problem solving.coaching from parents can be useful in helping children to make friends. eileen kennedy-moore describes three key ingredients of childrens friendship formation:  parents can also help children understand social guidelines they havent learned on their own. drawing from research by robert selman and others, kennedy-moore outlines developmental stages in childrens friendship, reflecting an increasing capacity to understand others perspectives: ""i want it my way"", ""whats in it for me?"", ""by the rules"", ""caring and sharing"", and ""friends through thick and thin.""in adolescence, friendships become ""more giving, sharing, frank, supportive, and spontaneous."" adolescents tend to seek out peers who can provide such qualities in a reciprocal relationship, and to avoid peers whose problematic behavior suggest they may not be able to satisfy these needs. relationships begin to maintain a focus on shared values, loyalty, and common interests, rather than physical concerns like proximity and access to play things that more characterize childhood.:246a study performed at the university of texas at austin examined over 9,000 american adolescents to determine how their engagement in problematic behavior a study by researchers from purdue university found that friendships formed during post-secondary education last longer than friendships formed earlier.friendship in adulthood provides companionship, affection, as well as emotional support, and contributes positively to mental well-being and improved physical health.:426adults may find it particularly difficult to maintain meaningful friendships in the workplace. ""the workplace can crackle with competition, so people learn to hide vulnerabilities and quirks from colleagues. work friendships often take on a transactional feel; it is difficult to say where networking ends and real friendship begins."" most adults value the financial security of their jobs more than friendship with coworkers.the majority of adults have an average of two close friends. numerous studies with adults suggest that friendships and other supportive relationships do enhance self-esteem.older adults continue to report high levels of personal satisfaction in their friendships as they age, even as the overall number of friends tends to decline. this satisfaction is associated with an increased ability to accomplish activities of daily living, as well as a reduced decline in cognitive abilities, decreased instances of hospitalization, and better outcomes related to rehabilitation.:427 the overall number of reported friends in later life may be mediated by increased lucidity, better speech and vision, and marital status.:53as one review phrased it:research within the past four decades has now consistently found that older adults reporting the highest levels of happiness and general well being also report strong, close ties to numerous friends.as family responsibilities and vocational pressures lessen, friendships become more important. among the elderly, friendships can provide links to the larger community, serve as a protective factor against depression and loneliness, and compensate for potential losses in social support previously given by family members.:32007 review, no treatment was identified which effectively address peer functioning in children with adhd, and treatments which addressed other aspects of the disorder were not found to eliminate issues related to peer functioning.certain symptoms of autism spectrum disorders can interfere with the formation of interpersonal relations, such as a preference for routine actions, resistance to change, obsession with particular interests or rituals, and a lack of social skills. children with autism have been found to be more likely to be close friends of one person, rather than having groups of friends. additionally, they are more likely to be close friends of other children with some sort of a disability. a sense of parental attachment aids in the quality of friendships in children with autism spectrum disorders; a sense of attachment with ones parents compensates for a lack of social skills that would usually inhibit friendships.a study done by frankel et al. showed that parental intervention and instruction plays an important role in such children developing friendships. along with parental intervention, school professionals play an important role in teaching social skills and peer interaction. paraprofessionals, specifically one-on-one aides and classroom aides, are often placed with children with autism spectrum disorders in order to facilitate friendships and guide the child in making and maintaining substantial friendships.although lessons and training may help peers of children with autism, bullying is still a major concern in social situations. according to anahad oconnor of the new york times, bullying is most likely to occur against children with autism spectrum disorders who have the most potential to live independently. such children are more at risk because they have as many of the rituals and lack of social skills as children with lower-functioning children with down syndrome have increased difficulty forming friendships. they experience a language delay causing them to have a harder time playing with other children. most children with down syndrome may prefer to watch other students and play alongside a friend but not with them, mostly because they understand more than they can outwardly express. in preschool years, children with down syndrome can benefit from the classroom setting, surrounded by other children and less dependent on adult aid. children with this disability benefit from a variety of interactions with both adults and children. at school, ensuring an inclusive environment in the classroom can be difficult, but proximity to close friends can be crucial for social development.studies have found that strong social supports improve a persons prospects for good health and longevity. conversely, loneliness and a lack of social supports have been linked to an increased risk of heart disease, viral infections, and cancer, as well as higher mortality rates overall. two researchers have even termed friendship networks a ""behavioral vaccine"" that boosts both physical and mental health.there is a large body of research linking friendship and health, but the precise reasons for the connection remain unclear. most of the studies in this area are large prospective studies that follow people over time, and while there may be a correlation between the two variables the lack of friendship has been found to play a role in increasing risk of suicidal ideation among female adolescents, including having more friends who were not themselves friends with one another. however, no similar effect was observed for males. having few or no friends is a major indicator in the diagnosis of a range of mental disorders.higher friendship quality directly contributes to self-esteem, self-confidence, and social development. a world happiness database study found that people with close friendships are happier, although the absolute number of friends did not increase happiness. other studies have suggested that children who have friendships of a high quality may be protected against the development of certain disorders, such as anxiety and depression. conversely, having few friends is associated with dropping out of school, as well as aggression, and adult crime.:500 peer rejection is also associated with lower later aspiration in the workforce, and participation in social activities, while higher levels of friendship was associated with higher adult self-esteem.:50048friends tend to be more similar to one another in terms of age, gender, behavior, substance abuse, personal disposition, and academic performance.:248:426:5564in general, female-female friendship interactions among children tend to be more focused on interpersonal connections and mutual support, while male-male interaction tends to be more focused on social status, and may actively discourage the expression of emotional needs.:320 females report more anxiety, jealousy, and relational victimization and less stability related to their friendships, and males report higher levels of physical victimization. nevertheless, males and females tend to report comparative levels of satisfaction with their friendships.:249\x80\x9350 males are more likely to define intimacy in terms of shared physical experiences while females are more likely to define it in terms of shared emotional ones. males are less likely to make emotional or personal disclosures to other males, because this could potentially be information used against them. they will disclose this to females however among older adults, women tend to be more socially adept than their male peers, and many older men may rely upon a female companion, such as a spouse, in order to compensate for their comparative lack of social skills.:55 research has also found that women are more likely than men to self-report having a best friend.friendship is found among animals of higher intelligence, such as higher mammals and some birds. cross-species friendships are common between humans and domestic animals. cross-species friendships may also occur between two non-human animals, such as dogs and cats.",1,0

"coordinates: 6107 square kilometres  and a population of 5,312,300  the country shares a long eastern border with sweden  the norwegian state has large ownership positions in key industrial sectors, having extensive reserves of petroleum, natural gas, minerals, lumber, seafood, and fresh water. the petroleum industry accounts for around a quarter of the countrys gross domestic product  on a per-capita basis, norway is the worlds largest producer of oil and natural gas outside of the middle east.the country has the fourth-highest per-capita income in the world on the world bank and imf lists. on the cias gdp  it has the worlds largest sovereign wealth fund, with a value of us$1009, a position also held previously between 2001 and 2006; it also has the highest inequality-adjusted ranking per 2018. norway ranked first on the world happiness report for 2017 and currently ranks first on the oecd better life index, the index of public integrity, and the democracy index. norway also has one of the lowest crime rates in the world.norway has two official names: norge in bokm7 metres these states were based on either clans or tribes  along the western fjords and islands called the gulatingslag. the frostating was the assembly for the leaders in the trondheimsfjord area; the earls of lade, near trondheim, seem to have enlarged the frostatingslag by adding the coastland from romsdalsfjord to lofoten.from the 8th to the 10th century, the wider scandinavian region was the source of vikings. the looting of the monastery at lindisfarne in northeast england in 793 by norse people has long been regarded as the event which marked the beginning of the viking age. this age was characterised by expansion and emigration by viking seafarers. they colonised, raided, and traded in all parts of europe. norwegian viking explorers discovered iceland by accident in the 9th century when heading for the faroe islands, and eventually came across vinland, known today as newfoundland, in canada. the vikings from norway were most active in the northern and western british isles and eastern north america isles.according to tradition, harald fairhair unified them into one in 872 after the battle of hafrsfjord in stavanger, thus becoming the first king of a united norway. haralds realm was mainly a south norwegian coastal state. fairhair ruled with a strong hand and according to the sagas, many norwegians left the country to live in iceland, the faroe islands, greenland, and parts of britain and ireland. the modern-day irish cities of dublin, limerick and waterford were founded by norwegian settlers.norse traditions were replaced slowly by christian ones in the late 10th and early 11th centuries. one of the most important sources for the history of the 11th century vikings is the treaty between the icelanders and olaf haraldsson, king of norway circa 1015 to 1028. this is largely attributed to the missionary kings olav tryggvasson and st. olav. haakon the good was norways first christian king, in the mid-10th century, though his attempt to introduce the religion was rejected. born sometime in between 963 and 969, olav tryggvasson set off raiding in england with 390 ships. he attacked london during this raiding. arriving back in norway in 995, olav landed in moster. there he built a church which became the first christian church ever built in norway. from moster, olav sailed north to trondheim where he was proclaimed king of norway by the eyrathing in 995.feudalism never really developed in norway or sweden, as it did in the rest of europe. however, the administration of government took on a very conservative feudal character. the hanseatic league forced the royalty to cede to them greater and greater concessions over foreign trade and the economy. the league had this hold over the royalty because of the loans the hansa had made to the royalty and the large debt the kings were carrying. the leagues monopolistic control over the economy of norway put pressure on all classes, especially the peasantry, to the degree that no real burgher class existed in norway.from the 1040s to 1130, the country was at peace.  in 1130, the civil war era broke out on the basis of unclear succession laws, which allowed all the kings sons to rule jointly. for periods there could be peace, before a lesser son allied himself with a chieftain and started a new conflict. the archdiocese of nidaros was created in 1152 and attempted to control the appointment of kings. the church inevitably had to take sides in the conflicts, with the civil wars also becoming an issue regarding the churchs influence of the king. the wars ended in 1217 with the appointment of h0s.upon the death of haakon v in 1349, the black death radically altered norway, killing between 50% and 60% of its population and leaving it in a period of social and economic decline. the plague left norway very poor. although the death rate was comparable with the rest of europe, economic recovery took much longer because of the small, scattered population. even before the plague, the population was only about 500,000. after the plague, many farms lay idle while the population slowly increased. however, the few surviving farms tenants found their bargaining positions with their landlords greatly strengthened.king magnus vii ruled norway until 1350, when his son, haakon, was placed on the throne as haakon vi. in 1363, haakon vi married margaret, the daughter of king valdemar iv of denmark. upon the death of haakon vi, in 1379, his son, olaf iv, was only 10 years old. olaf had already been elected to the throne of denmark on 3 may 1376. thus, upon olafs accession to the throne of norway, denmark and norway entered personal union. olafs mother and haakons widow, queen margaret, managed the foreign affairs of denmark and norway during the minority of olaf iv.margaret was working toward a union of sweden with denmark and norway by having olaf elected to the swedish throne. she was on the verge of achieving this goal when olaf iv suddenly died. however, denmark made margaret temporary ruler upon the death of olaf. on 2 february 1388, norway followed suit and crowned margaret. queen margaret knew that her power would be more secure if she were able to find a king to rule in her place. she settled on eric of pomerania, grandson of her sister. thus at an all-scandinavian meeting held at kalmar, erik of pomerania was crowned king of all three scandinavian countries. thus, royal politics resulted in personal unions between the nordic countries, eventually bringing the thrones of norway, denmark, and sweden under the control of queen margaret when the country entered into the kalmar union.after sweden broke out of the kalmar union in 1521, norway tried to follow suit, but the subsequent rebellion was defeated, and norway remained in a union with denmark until 1814, a total of 434 years. during the national romanticism of the 19th century, this period was by some referred to as the ""400-year night"", since all of the kingdoms royal, intellectual, and administrative power was centred in copenhagen in denmark. in fact, it was a period of great prosperity and progress for norway, especially in terms of shipping and foreign trade, and it also secured the countrys revival from the demographic catastrophe it suffered in the black death. based on the respective natural resources, denmark. as the danish kingdom found itself on the losing side in 1814, it was forced, under terms of the treaty of kiel, to cede norway to the king of sweden, while the old norwegian provinces of iceland, greenland, and the faroe islands remained with the danish crown. norway took this opportunity to declare independence, adopted a constitution based on american and french models, and elected the crown prince of denmark and norway, christian frederick, as king on 17 may 1814. this is the famous syttende mai  the belligerents were forced to negotiate the convention of moss. according to the terms of the convention, christian frederik abdicated the norwegian throne and authorised the parliament of norway to make the necessary constitutional amendments to allow for the personal union that norway was forced to accept. on 4 november 1814, the parliament  under this arrangement, norway kept its liberal constitution and its own independent institutions, though it shared a common monarch and common foreign policy with sweden. following the recession caused by the napoleonic wars, economic development of norway remained slow until economic growth began around 1830.this period also saw the rise of the norwegian romantic nationalism, as norwegians sought to define and express a distinct national character. the movement covered all branches of culture, including literature , bj0,000 persons. the membership was drawn from the lower classes of both urban and rural areas; for the first time these two groups felt they had a common cause. in the end, the revolt was easily crushed; thrane was captured and in 1855, after four years in jail, was sentenced to three additional years for crimes against the safety of the state. upon his release, marcus thrane attempted unsuccessfully to revitalise his movement, but after the death of his wife, he migrated to the united states.in 1898, all men were granted universal suffrage, followed by all women in 1913.christian michelsen, a shipping magnate and statesman, and prime minister of norway from 1905 to 1907, played a central role in the peaceful separation of norway from sweden on 7 june 1905. a national referendum confirmed the peoples preference for a monarchy over a republic. however, no norwegian could legitimately claim the throne, since none of norways noble families could claim descent from medieval royalty. in european tradition, royal or ""blue"" blood is a precondition for laying claim to the throne.the government then offered the throne of norway to prince carl of denmark, a prince of the dano-german royal house of schleswig-holstein-sonderburg-gl.from 1945 to 1962, the labour party held an absolute majority in the parliament. the government, led by prime minister einar gerhardsen, embarked on a program inspired by keynesian economics, emphasising state financed industrialisation and co-operation between trade unions and employers organisations. many measures of state control of the economy imposed during the war were continued, although the rationing of dairy products was lifted in 1949, while price control and rationing of housing and cars continued until 1960.the wartime alliance with the united kingdom and the united states was continued in the post-war years. although pursuing the goal of a socialist economy, the labour party distanced itself from the communists  in 1969, the phillips petroleum company discovered petroleum resources at the ekofisk field west of norway. in 1973, the norwegian government founded the state oil company, statoil. oil production did not provide net income until the early 1980s because of the large capital investment that was required to establish the countrys petroleum industry. around 1975, both the proportion and absolute number of workers in industry peaked. since then labour-intensive industries and services like factory mass production and shipping have largely been outsourced.norway was a founding member of the european free trade association in 1981, a conservative government led by k66.norway comprises the western and northernmost part of scandinavia in northern europe. norway lies between latitudes 57,532 kilometres  norway shares a 1,619-kilometre  the scandinavian mountains form much of the border with sweden.at 385,207 square kilometres  much of the country is dominated by mountainous or high terrain, with a great variety of natural features caused by prehistoric glaciers and varied topography. the most noticeable of these are the fjords: deep grooves cut into the land flooded by the sea following the end of the ice age. sognefjorden is the worlds second deepest fjord, and the worlds longest at 204 kilometres  norway has about 400,000 lakes. there are 239,057 registered islands. permafrost can be found all year in the higher mountain areas and in the interior of finnmark county. numerous glaciers are found in norway.the land is mostly made of hard granite and gneiss rock, but slate, sandstone, and limestone are also common, and the lowest elevations contain marine deposits. because of the gulf stream and prevailing westerlies, norway experiences higher temperatures and more precipitation than expected at such northern latitudes, especially along the coast. the mainland experiences four distinct seasons, with colder winters and less precipitation inland. the northernmost part has a mostly maritime subarctic climate, while svalbard has an arctic tundra climate.because of the large latitudinal range of the country and the varied topography and climate, norway has a larger number of different habitats than almost any other european country. there are approximately 60,000 species in norway and adjacent waters the southern and western parts of norway, fully exposed to atlantic storm fronts, experience more precipitation and have milder winters than the eastern and far northern parts. areas to the east of the coastal mountains are in a rain shadow, and have lower rain and snow totals than the west. the lowlands around oslo have the warmest and sunniest summers, but also cold weather and snow in wintertime.because of norways high latitude, there are large seasonal variations in daylight. from late may to late july, the sun never completely descends beneath the horizon in areas north of the arctic circle  as a side-effect, the scandinavian mountains prevent continental winds from reaching the coastline, causing very cool summers throughout atlantic norway. oslo has more of a continental climate, similar to swedens. the mountain ranges have subarctic and tundra climates. there is also very high rainfall in areas exposed to the atlantic, such as bergen. oslo, in comparison, is dry, being in a rain shadow. skj78 millimetres parts of southeastern norway including parts of mj010 encompasses 4,599 species.seventeen species are listed mainly because they are endangered on a global scale, such as the european beaver, even if the population in norway is not seen as endangered. the number of threatened and near-threatened species equals to 3,682; it includes 418 fungi species, many of which are closely associated with the small remaining areas of old-growth forests, 36 bird species, and 16 species of mammals. in 2010, 2,398 species were listed as endangered or vulnerable; of these were 1250 listed as vulnerable the largest predator in norwegian waters is the sperm whale, and the largest fish is the basking shark. the largest predator on land is the polar bear, while the brown bear is the largest predator on the norwegian mainland. the largest land animal on the mainland is the elk  the west coast of southern norway and the coast of northern norway present some of the most visually impressive coastal sceneries in the world. national geographic has listed the norwegian fjords as the worlds top tourist attraction. the country is also home to the natural phenomena of the midnight sun the 2016 environmental performance index from yale university, columbia university and the world economic forum put norway in seventeenth place, immediately below croatia and switzerland. the index is based on environmental risks to human health, habitat loss, and changes in co2 emissions. the index notes over-exploitation of fisheries, but not norways whaling or oil exports.norway is considered to be one of the most developed democracies and states of justice in the world. from 1814, c. 45% of men according to the constitution of norway, which was adopted on 17 may 1814 and inspired by the united states declaration of independence and french revolution of 1776 and 1789, respectively, norway is a unitary constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary system of government, wherein the king of norway is the head of state and the prime minister is the head of government. power is separated among the legislative, executive and judicial branches of government, as defined by the constitution, which serves as the countrys supreme legal document.the monarch officially retains executive power. but following the introduction of a parliamentary system of government, the duties of the monarch have since become strictly representative and ceremonial, such as the formal appointment and dismissal of the prime minister and other ministers in the executive government. accordingly, the monarch is commander-in-chief of the norwegian armed forces, and serves as chief diplomatic official abroad and as a symbol of unity. harald v of the house of schleswig-holstein-sonderburg-gl012. the issue of separation of church and state in norway has been increasingly controversial, as many people believe it is time to change this, to reflect the growing diversity in the population. a part of this is the evolution of the public school subject christianity, a required subject since 1739. even the states loss in a battle at the european court of human rights at strasbourg in 2007 did not settle the matter. as of 1 january 2017, the church of norway is a separate legal entity, and no longer a branch of the civil service.through the council of state, a privy council presided over by the monarch, the prime minister and the cabinet meet at the royal palace and formally consult the monarch. all government bills need the formal approval by the monarch before and after introduction to parliament. the council reviews and approves all of the monarchs actions as head of state. although all government and parliamentary acts are decided beforehand, the privy council is an example of symbolic gesture the king retains.members of the storting are directly elected from party-lists proportional representation in nineteen plural-member constituencies in a national multi-party system. historically, both the norwegian labour party and conservative party have played leading political roles. in the early 21st century, the labour party has been in power since the 2005 election, in a red005, both the conservative party and the progress party have won numerous seats in the parliament, but not sufficient in the 2009 general election to overthrow the coalition. commentators have pointed to the poor co-operation between the opposition parties, including the liberals and the christian democrats. jens stoltenberg, the leader of the labour party, continued to have the necessary majority through his multi-party alliance to continue as pm until 2013.in national elections in september 2013, voters ended eight years of labor rule. two political parties, h0 permanent judges and a chief justice, appellate courts, city and district courts, and conciliation councils. the judiciary is independent of executive and legislative branches. while the prime minister nominates supreme court justices for office, their nomination must be approved by parliament and formally confirmed by the monarch in the council of state. usually, judges attached to regular courts are formally appointed by the monarch on the advice of the prime minister.the courts strict and formal mission is to regulate the norwegian judicial system, interpret the constitution, and as such implement the legislation adopted by parliament. in its judicial reviews, it monitors the legislative and executive branches to ensure that they comply with provisions of enacted legislation.the law is enforced in norway by the norwegian police service. it is a unified national police service made up of 27 police districts and several specialist agencies, such as norwegian national authority for the investigation and prosecution of economic and environmental crime, known as . the legislature abolished the death penalty for high treason in war and war-crimes in 1979. reporters without borders, in its 2007 worldwide press freedom index, ranked norway at a shared first place in general, the legal and institutional framework in norway is characterised by a high degree of transparency, accountability and integrity, and the perception and the occurrence of corruption are very low. norway has ratified all relevant international anti-corruption conventions, and its standards of implementation and enforcement of anti-corruption legislation are considered very high by many international anti-corruption working groups such as the oecd anti-bribery working group. however, there are some isolated cases showing that some municipalities have abused their position in public procurement processes.norwegian prisons are humane, rather than tough, with emphasis on rehabilitation. at 20%, norways re-conviction rate is among the lowest in the world.norway maintains embassies in 82 countries. 60 countries maintain an embassy in norway, all of them in the capital, oslo.norway is a founding member of the united nations  successive norwegian governments have, since 1994, requested participation in parts of the eus co-operation that go beyond the provisions of the eea agreement. non-voting participation by norway has been granted in, for instance, the unions common security and defence policy, the schengen agreement, and the european defence agency, as well as 19 separate programmes.norway participated in the 1990s brokering of the oslo accords, an unsuccessful attempt to resolve the israeli5,000 personnel, including civilian employees. according to 2009 mobilisation plans, full mobilisation produces approximately 83,000 combatant personnel. norway has conscription  in 2013, the country became the first in europe and nato to draft women as well as men. however, due to less need for conscripts after the cold war ended with the break-up of the soviet union, few people have to serve if they are not motivated. the armed forces are subordinate to the norwegian ministry of defence. the commander-in-chief is king harald v. the military of norway is divided into the following branches: the norwegian army, the royal norwegian navy, the royal norwegian air force, the norwegian cyber defence force and the home guard.in response to its being overrun by germany in 1940, the country was one of the founding nations of the north atlantic treaty organization  additionally, norway has contributed in several missions in contexts of the united nations, nato, and the common security and defence policy of the european union.norwegians enjoy the second-highest gdp per-capita among european countries  according to the cia world factbook, norway is a net external creditor of debt. norway maintained first place in the world in the undp human development index  the standard of living in norway is among the highest in the world. foreign policy magazine ranks norway last in its failed states index for 2009, judging norway to be the worlds most well-functioning and stable country. the oecd ranks norway fourth in the 2013 equalised better life index and third in intergenerational earnings elasticity.the norwegian economy is an example of a mixed economy; a prosperous capitalist welfare state it features a combination of free market activity and large state ownership in certain key sectors, influenced by both liberal governments from the late 19th century and later by social democratic governments in the postwar era. public health care in norway is free  parental leave. the state income derived from natural resources includes a significant contribution from petroleum production. norway has an unemployment rate of 4.8%, with 68% of the population aged 15011, 28% of state revenues were generated from the petroleum industry.norway is the first country which banned cutting of trees export revenues from oil and gas have risen to over 40% of total exports and constitute almost 20% of the gdp. norway is the fifth-largest oil exporter and third-largest gas exporter in the world, but it is not a member of opec. in 1995, the norwegian government established the sovereign wealth fund between 1966 and 2013, norwegian companies drilled 5085 oil wells, mostly in the north sea. of these 3672 are utviklingsbr013, 65 to 7013, its mineral production was valued at us$1.5017, the government pension fund controlled assets surpassed a value of us$1 trillion  about 250% of norways 2017 gdp. it is the largest sovereign wealth fund in the world. the fund controls about 1.3% of all listed shares in europe, and more than 1% of all the publicly traded shares in the world. the norwegian central bank operates investment offices in london, new york, and shanghai. guidelines implemented in 2007 allow the fund to invest up to 60% of the capital in shares other nations with economies based on natural resources, such as russia, are trying to learn from norway by establishing similar funds. the investment choices of the norwegian fund are directed by ethical guidelines; for example, the fund is not allowed to invest in companies that produce parts for nuclear weapons. norways highly transparent investment scheme is lauded by the international community. the future size of the fund is closely linked to the price of oil and to developments in international financial markets.in 2000, the government sold one-third of the state-owned oil company statoil in an ipo. the next year, the main telecom supplier, telenor, was listed on oslo stock exchange. the state also owns significant shares of norways largest bank, dnb nor and the airline sas. since 2000, economic growth has been rapid, pushing unemployment down to levels not seen since the early 1980s  under discussion is development of a new high-speed rail system between the nations largest cities.norways main railway network consists of 4,114 kilometres  the entire network is owned by the norwegian national rail administration. all domestic passenger trains except the airport express train are operated by norges statsbaner  several companies operate freight trains.investment in new infrastructure and maintenance is financed through the state budget, and subsidies are provided for passenger train operations. nsb operates long-haul trains, including night trains, regional services and four commuter train systems, around oslo, trondheim, bergen and stavanger.norway has approximately 92,946 kilometres  the four tiers of road routes are national, county, municipal and private, with national and primary county roads numbered en route. the most important national routes are part of the european route scheme. the two most prominent are the european route e6 going north014, norway became the first country where over 1 in every 100 passenger cars on the roads is a plug-in electric. the plug-in electric segment market share of new car sales is also the highest in the world. according to a report by dagens n016, the country would like to ban sales of gasoline and diesel powered vehicles as early as 2025. in june 2017, 42% of new cars registered were electric.of the 98 airports in norway, 52 are public, and 46 are operated by the state-owned avinor. seven airports have more than one million passengers annually. a total of 41,089,675 passengers passed through norwegian airports in 2007, of whom 13,397,458 were international.the central gateway to norway by air is oslo airport, gardermoen. located about 35 kilometres  and norwegian air shuttle, and for regional aircraft from western norway. there are departures to most european countries and some intercontinental destinations. a direct high-speed train connects to oslo central station every 10 minutes for a 20 min ride.norways population was 5,384,576 people as of the third quarter of 2020. norwegians are an ethnic north germanic people. since the late 20th century, norway has attracted immigrants from southern and central europe, the middle east, africa, asia and beyond.the total fertility rate  below the replacement rate of 2.1, it remains considerably below the high of 4.69 children born per woman in 1877. in 2018 the median age of the norwegian population was 39.3 years.in 2012, an official study showed that 86% of the total population have at least one parent who was born in norway. as of 2020 approximately 980,000 individuals  among these approximately 189,000 are children of immigrants, born in norway.of these 980,000 immigrants and their descendants:in 2013, the norwegian government said that 14% of the norwegian population were immigrants or children of two immigrant parents. about 6% of the immigrant population come from eu, north america and australia, and about 8.1% come from asia, africa and latin america.in 2012, of the total 660,000 with immigrant background, 407,262 had norwegian citizenship immigrants have settled in all norwegian municipalities. the cities or municipalities with the highest share of immigrants in 2012 were oslo  the share in stavanger was 16%. according to reuters, oslo is the ""fastest growing city in europe because of increased immigration"". in recent years, immigration has accounted for most of norways population growth. in 2011, 16% of newborn children were of immigrant background.the s0th century. from the 19th century up to the 1970s, the norwegian government tried to assimilate both the s006, according to the us census bureau, almost 4.7011 canadian census, 452,705 canadian citizens identified as having norwegian ancestry.on 1 january 2013, the number of immigrants or children of two immigrants residing in norway was 710,465, or 14.1% of the total population, up from 183,000 in 1992. yearly immigration has increased since 2005. while yearly net immigration in 2001005 was on average 13,613, it increased to 37,541 between 2006 and 2010, and in 2011 net immigration reached 47,032. this is mostly because of increased immigration by residents of the eu, in particular from poland.in 2012, the immigrant community  net immigration from abroad reached 47,300  17% of newborn children were born to immigrant parents. children of pakistani, somali and vietnamese parents made up the largest groups of all norwegians born to immigrant parents.pakistani norwegians are the largest non-european minority group in norway. most of their 32,700 members live in and around oslo. the iraqi and somali immigrant populations have increased significantly in recent years. after the enlargement of the eu in 2004, a wave of immigrants arrived from central and northern europe, particularly poland, sweden and lithuania. the fastest growing immigrant groups in 2011 in absolute numbers were from poland, lithuania and sweden. the policies of immigration and integration have been the subject of much debate in norway.separation of church and state happened significantly later in norway than in most of europe, and remains incomplete. in 2012, the norwegian parliament voted to grant the church of norway greater autonomy, a decision which was confirmed in a constitutional amendment on 21 may 2012.until 2012 parliamentary officials were required to be members of the evangelical-lutheran church of norway, and at least half of all government ministers had to be a member of the state church. as state church, the church of norways clergy were viewed as state employees, and the central and regional church administrations were part of the state administration. members of the royal family are required to be members of the lutheran church. on 1 january 2017, norway made the church independent of the state, but retained the churchs status as the ""peoples church"".most norwegians are registered at baptism as members of the church of norway, which has been norways state church since its establishment. in recent years the church has been granted increasing internal autonomy, but it retains its special constitutional status and other special ties to the state, and the constitution requires that the reigning monarch must be a member and states that the countrys values are based on its christian and humanist heritage. many remain in the church to participate in the community and practices such as baptism, confirmation, marriage and burial rites. about 70.6% of norwegians were members of the church of norway in 2017. in 2017, about 53.6% of all newborns were baptised and about 57.9% of all 15-year-old persons were confirmed in the church.according to the 2010 eurobarometer poll, 22% of norwegian citizens responded that ""they believe there is a god"", 44% responded that ""they believe there is some sort of spirit or life force"" and 29% responded that ""they dont believe there is any sort of spirit, god or life force"". five percent gave no response. in the early 1990s, studies estimated that between 4.7% and 5.3% of norwegians attended church on a weekly basis. this figure has dropped to about 2%.in 2010, 10% of the population was religiously unaffiliated, while another 9% were members of religious communities outside the church of norway. other christian denominations total about 4.9% of the population, the largest of which is the roman catholic church, with 83,000 members, according to 2009 government statistics. the aftenposten others include pentecostals  the evangelical lutheran free church of norway  methodists  baptists  eastern orthodox  brunstad christian church  seventh-day adventists  assyrians and chaldeans, and others. the swedish, finnish and icelandic lutheran congregations in norway have about 27,500 members in total. other christian denominations comprise less than 1% each, including 4,000 members in the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints and 12,000 jehovahs witnesses.among non-christian religions, islam is the largest, with 166,861 registered members  it is practised mainly by somali, arab, bosniak, kurdish and turkish immigrants, as well as norwegians of pakistani descent.other religions comprise less than 1% each, including 819 adherents of judaism. indian immigrants introduced hinduism to norway, which in 2011 has slightly more than 5,900 adherents, or 1% of non-lutheran norwegians. sikhism has approximately 3,000 adherents, with most living in oslo, which has two gurdwaras. sikhs first came to norway in the early 1970s. the troubles in punjab after operation blue star and riots committed against sikhs in india after the assassination of indira gandhi led to an increase in sikh refugees moving to norway. drammen also has a sizeable population of sikhs; the largest gurdwara in north europe was built in lier. there are eleven buddhist organisations, grouped under the buddhistforbundet organisation, with slightly over 14,000 members, which make up 0.2% of the population. the bah011, the fellowship had about 300 members. foreningen forn sed was formed in 1999 and has been recognised by the norwegian government.the s013 the infant mortality rate was 2.5 per 1,000 live births among children under the age of one. for girls it was 2.7 and for boys 2.3, which is the lowest infant mortality rate for boys ever recorded in norway.higher education in norway is offered by a range of seven universities, five specialised colleges, 25 university colleges as well as a range of private colleges. education follows the bologna process involving bachelor  acceptance is offered after finishing upper secondary school with general study competence.public education is virtually free, regardless of nationality. the academic year has two semesters, from august to december and from january to june. the ultimate responsibility for the education lies with the norwegian ministry of education and research.norwegian and s0th centuries, the norwegian language was subject to strong political and cultural controversies. this led to the development of nynorsk in the 19th century and to the formation of alternative spelling standards in the 20th century.norwegian is similar to its neighbour scandinavian languages; swedish and danish. all three languages are to a degree mutually intelligible and can be, and commonly are, employed in communication among inhabitants of the scandinavian countries. as a result of the co-operation within the nordic council, inhabitants of all nordic countries, including iceland and finland, have the right to communicate with norwegian authorities in their own language.students who are children of immigrant parents are encouraged to learn the norwegian language. the norwegian government offers language instructional courses for immigrants wishing to obtain norwegian citizenship. with increasing concern about assimilating immigrants, since 1 september 2008, the government has required that an applicant for norwegian citizenship give evidence of proficiency in either norwegian or in one of the s009 norway became the sixth country to grant full marriage equality to same-sex couples. as a promoter of human rights, norway has held the annual oslo freedom forum conference, a gathering described by the economist as ""on its way to becoming a human-rights equivalent of the davos economic forum.""the norwegian cinema has received international recognition. the documentary film kon-tiki the country has also been used as filming location for several hollywood and other international productions, including the empire strikes back  a short film, the spirit of norway, was featured at maelstrom at norway pavilion at epcot located within walt disney world resort in florida in the united states. the attraction and the film ceased their operations on 5 october 2014. the classical music of the romantic composers edvard grieg, rikard nordraak and johan svendsen is internationally known, as is the modern music of arne nordheim. norways classical performers include leif ove andsnes, one of the worlds more famous pianists; truls m0th century. since the 1990s, norways export of black metal, a lo-fi, dark and raw form of heavy metal, has been developed by such bands as emperor, darkthrone, gorgoroth, mayhem, burzum and immortal. more recently, bands such as enslaved, kvelertak, dimmu borgir and satyricon have evolved the genre into the present day while still garnering worldwide fans. controversial events associated with the black metal movement in the early 1990s included several church burnings and two prominent murder cases.the jazz scene in norway is thriving. jan garbarek, terje rypdal, mari boine, arild andersen and bugge wesseltoft are internationally recognised while paal nilssen-love, supersilent, jaga jazzist and wibutee are becoming world-class artists of the younger generation. norway has a strong folk music tradition which remains popular to this day. among the most prominent folk musicians are hardanger fiddlers andrea een, olav j000s, the group maintained its popularity domestically, and has remained successful outside norway, especially in germany, switzerland, france, and brazil.some of the most memorable female solo artists from norway are susanne sundf0th century, the city of 0th century that norwegian architects have achieved international renown. one of the most striking modern buildings in norway is the s9 international masters in norway.norwegian players in the national football league bandy is a traditional sport in norway and the country is one of the four founders of federation of international bandy. in terms of licensed athletes, it is the second biggest winter sport in the world. as of january 2018, the mens national team has captured one silver and one bronze, while the womens national team has managed five bronzes at the world championships.norway first participated at the olympic games in 1900, and has sent athletes to compete in every games since then, except for the sparsely attended 1904 games and the 1980 summer olympics in moscow when they participated in the american-led boycott. norway leads the overall medal tables at the winter olympic games by a considerable margin. famous norwegian winter sport athletes includes biathlete ole einar bj016 winter youth olympics in lillehammer, making norway the first country to host both winter regular and youth olympics.as of 2008, norway ranks 17th in the world economic forums travel and tourism competitiveness report. tourism in norway contributed to 4.2% of the gross domestic product as reported in 2016. every one in fifteen people throughout the country work in the tourism industry. tourism is seasonal in norway, with more than half of total tourists visiting between the months of may and august.the main attractions of norway are the varied landscapes that extend across the arctic circle. it is famous for its fjord-indented coastline and its mountains, ski resorts, lakes and woods. popular tourist destinations in norway include oslo, \xc3\xa5lesund, bergen, stavanger, trondheim, kristiansand and troms\xc3\xb8. much of the nature of norway remains unspoiled, and thus attracts numerous hikers and skiers. the fjords, mountains and waterfalls in western and northern norway attract several hundred thousand foreign tourists each year. in the cities, cultural idiosyncrasies such as the holmenkollen ski jump attract many visitors, as do landmarks such as bergens bryggen and oslos vigeland sculpture park.",1,0
"painting is the practice of applying paint, pigment, color or other medium to a solid surface  the medium is commonly applied to the base with a brush, but other implements, such as knives, sponges, and airbrushes, can be used.in art, the term painting describes both the act and the result of the action  paintings can be naturalistic and representational  kandinsky, and newton, have written their own color theory.moreover, the use of language is only an abstraction for a color equivalent. the word ""red"", for example, can cover a wide range of variations from the pure red of the visible spectrum of light. there is not a formalized register of different colors in the way that there is agreement on different notes in music, such as f or c018, the oldest known paintings were believed to be about 32,000 years old, at the grotte chauvet in france. they are engraved and painted using red ochre and black pigment, and they show horses, rhinoceros, lions, buffalo, mammoth, abstract designs and what are possibly partial human figures. cave paintings were then found in indonesia in the lubang jeriji sal9, photographic processes improved and became more widely practiced, depriving painting of much of its historic purpose to provide an accurate record of the observable world. a series of art movements in the late 19th and early 20th centuries1st century defy the previous ""declarations"" of its demise. in an epoch characterized by the idea of pluralism, there is no consensus as to a representative style of the age. artists continue to make important works of art in a wide variety of styles and aesthetic temperaments0th-century developments in painting, such as cubism, were reflections on the means of painting rather than on the external world0th century, the technique of porcelain enamel on metal has been used as a durable medium for outdoor murals.aerosol paint style is used in two senses: it can refer to the distinctive visual elements, techniques, and methods that typify an individual artists work. it can also refer to the movement or school that an artist is associated with. this can stem from an actual group that the artist was consciously involved with or it can be a category in which art historians have placed the painter. the word style in the latter sense has fallen out of favor in academic discussions about contemporary painting, though it continues to be used in popular contexts. such movements or classifications include the following:modernism describes both a set of cultural tendencies and an array of associated cultural movements, originally arising from wide-scale and far-reaching changes to western society in the late 19th century and early 20th century. modernism was a revolt against the conservative values of realism. the term encompasses the activities and output of those who felt the ""traditional"" forms of art, architecture, literature, religious faith, social organization, and daily life were becoming outdated in the new economic, social, and political conditions of an emerging fully industrialized world. a salient characteristic of modernism is self-consciousness. this often led to experiments with form, and work that draws attention to the processes and materials used the first example of modernism in painting was impressionism, a school of painting that initially focused on work done, not in studios, but outdoors  abstract expressionism was an american post-world war ii art movement that combined the emotional intensity and self-denial of the german expressionists with the anti-figurative aesthetic of the european abstract schools000s.surrealism is a cultural movement that began in the early 1920s, and is best known for the artistic and literary production of those affiliated with the surrealist movement. surrealist artworks feature the element of surprise, the uncanny, the unconscious, unexpected juxtapositions and non-sequitur; however, many surrealist artists and writers regard their work as an expression of the philosophical movement first and foremost, with the works being an artifact. leader andr0s onward, the movement spread around the globe, eventually affecting the visual arts, literature, film and music of many countries, as well as political thought and practice, philosophy and social theory.allegory is a figurative mode of representation conveying meaning other than the literal. allegory communicates its message by means of symbolic figures, actions, or symbolic representation. allegory is generally treated as a figure of rhetoric, but an allegory does not have to be expressed in language: it may be addressed to the eye and is often found in realistic painting. an example of a simple visual allegory is the image of the grim reaper. viewers understand that the image of the grim reaper is a symbolic representation of death.in spanish art, a bodeg\x80\x94which may be either natural (food, flowers, plants, rocks, or shells or man-made (drinking glasses, books, vases, jewelry, coins, pipes, and so on. with origins in the middle ages and ancient greek/roman art, still life paintings give the artist more leeway in the arrangement of design elements within a composition than do paintings of other types of subjects such as landscape or portraiture. still life paintings, particularly before 1700, often contained religious and allegorical symbolism relating to the objects depicted. some modern still life breaks the two-dimensional barrier and employs three-dimensional mixed media, and uses found objects, photography, computer graphics, as well as video and sound.a veduta is a highly detailed, usually large-scale painting of a cityscape or some other vista. this genre of landscape originated in flanders, where artists such as paul bril painted vedute as early as the 16th century. as the itinerary of the grand tour became somewhat standardized, vedute of familiar scenes like the roman forum or the grand canal recalled early ventures to the continent for aristocratic englishmen. in the later 19th century, more personal impressions of cityscapes replaced the desire for topographical accuracy, which was satisfied instead by painted panoramas.",1,0
"carcharhiniformesheterodontiformeshexanchiformeslamniformesorectolobiformespristiophoriformessqualiformessquatiniformes,000 metres  sharks have a covering of dermal denticles that protects their skin from damage and parasites in addition to improving their fluid dynamics. they have numerous sets of replaceable teeth.well-known species such as the tiger shark, blue shark, great white shark, mako shark, thresher shark, and hammerhead shark are apex predators0 million years ago, before land vertebrates existed and before a variety of plants had colonized the continents. only scales have been recovered from the first sharks and not all paleontologists agree that these are from true sharks, suspecting that these scales are actually those of thelodont agnathans. the oldest generally accepted shark scales are from about 420 million years ago, in the silurian period. the first sharks looked very different from modern sharks. at this time the most common shark tooth is the cladodont, a style of thin tooth with three tines like a trident, apparently to help catch fish. the majority of modern sharks can be traced back to around 100 million years ago. most fossils are of teeth, often in large numbers. partial skeletons and even complete fossilized remains have been discovered. estimates suggest that sharks grow tens of thousands of teeth over a lifetime, which explains the abundant fossils. the teeth consist of easily fossilized calcium phosphate, an apatite. when a shark dies, the decomposing skeleton breaks up, scattering the apatite prisms. preservation requires rapid burial in bottom sediments.among the most ancient and primitive sharks is cladoselache, from about 370 million years ago, which has been found within paleozoic strata in ohio, kentucky, and tennessee. at that point in earths history these rocks made up the soft bottom sediments of a large, shallow ocean, which stretched across much of north america. cladoselache was only about 1 metre  its teeth had several pointed cusps, which wore down from use. from the small number of teeth found together, it is most likely that cladoselache did not replace its teeth as regularly as modern sharks. its caudal fins had a similar shape to the great white sharks and the pelagic shortfin and longfin makos. the presence of whole fish arranged tail-first in their stomachs suggest that they were fast swimmers with great agility.most fossil sharks from about 300 to 150 million years ago can be assigned to one of two groups. the xenacanthida was almost exclusive to freshwater environments. by the time this group became extinct about 220 million years ago, they had spread worldwide. the other group, the hybodonts, appeared about 320 million years ago and lived mostly in the oceans, but also in freshwater. the results of a 2014 study of the gill structure of an unusually well preserved 325-million-year-old fossil suggested that sharks are not ""living fossils"", but rather have evolved more extensively than previously thought over the hundreds of millions of years they have been around.modern sharks began to appear about 100 million years ago. fossil mackerel shark teeth date to the early cretaceous. one of the most recently evolved families is the hammerhead shark  the oldest white shark teeth date from 60 to 66 million years ago, around the time of the extinction of the dinosaurs. in early white shark evolution there are at least two lineages: one lineage is of white sharks with coarsely serrated teeth and it probably gave rise to the modern great white shark, and another lineage is of white sharks with finely serrated teeth. these sharks attained gigantic proportions and include the extinct megatoothed shark, c. megalodon. like most extinct sharks, c. megalodon is also primarily known from its fossil teeth and vertebrae. this giant shark reached a total length  c. megalodon may have approached a maxima of 20.3 metres  paleontological evidence suggests that this shark was an active predator of large cetaceans.sharks belong to the superorder selachimorpha in the subclass elasmobranchii in the class chondrichthyes. the elasmobranchii also include rays and skates; the chondrichthyes also include chimaeras. it was thought that the sharks form a polyphyletic group: some sharks are more closely related to rays than they are to some other sharks, but current molecular studies support monophyly of both groups of sharks and batoids.the superorder selachimorpha is divided into galea there are more than 470 species of sharks split across twelve orders, including four orders of sharks that have gone extinct:shark teeth are embedded in the gums rather than directly affixed to the jaw, and are constantly replaced throughout life. multiple rows of replacement teeth grow in a groove on the inside of the jaw and steadily move forward in comparison to a conveyor belt; some sharks lose 30,000 or more teeth in their lifetime. the rate of tooth replacement varies from once every 8 to 10 days to several months. in most species, teeth are replaced one at a time as opposed to the simultaneous replacement of an entire row, which is observed in the cookiecutter shark.tooth shape depends on the sharks diet: those that feed on mollusks and crustaceans have dense and flattened teeth used for crushing, those that feed on fish have needle-like teeth for gripping, and those that feed on larger prey such as mammals have pointed lower teeth for gripping and triangular upper teeth with serrated edges for cutting. the teeth of plankton-feeders such as the basking shark are small and non-functional.shark skeletons are very different from those of bony fish and terrestrial vertebrates. sharks and other cartilaginous fish  because sharks do not have rib cages, they can easily be crushed under their own weight on land.the jaws of sharks, like those of rays and skates, are not attached to the cranium. the jaws surface  this gives these areas much of the same strength found in the bony tissue found in other animals.generally sharks have only one layer of tesserae, but the jaws of large specimens, such as the bull shark, tiger shark, and the great white shark, have two to three layers or more, depending on body size. the jaws of a large great white shark may have up to five layers. in the rostrum  most sharks have eight fins. sharks can only drift away from objects directly in front of them because their fins do not allow them to move in the tail-first direction.unlike bony fish, sharks have a complex dermal corset made of flexible collagenous fibers and arranged as a helical network surrounding their body. this works as an outer skeleton, providing attachment for their swimming muscles and thus saving energy. their dermal teeth give them hydrodynamic advantages as they reduce turbulence when swimming.tails provide thrust, making speed and acceleration dependent on tail shape. caudal fin shapes vary considerably between shark species, due to their evolution in separate environments. sharks possess a heterocercal caudal fin in which the dorsal portion is usually noticeably larger than the ventral portion. this is because the sharks vertebral column extends into that dorsal portion, providing a greater surface area for muscle attachment. this allows more efficient locomotion among these negatively buoyant cartilaginous fish. by contrast, most bony fish possess a homocercal caudal fin.tiger sharks have a large upper lobe, which allows for slow cruising and sudden bursts of speed. the tiger shark must be able to twist and turn in the water easily when hunting to support its varied diet, whereas the porbeagle shark, which hunts schooling fish such as mackerel and herring, has a large lower lobe to help it keep pace with its fast-swimming prey. other tail adaptations help sharks catch prey more directly, such as the thresher sharks usage of its powerful, elongated upper lobe to stun fish and squid.unlike bony fish, sharks do not have gas-filled swim bladders for buoyancy. instead, sharks rely on a large liver filled with oil that contains squalene, and their cartilage, which is about half the normal density of bone. their liver constitutes up to 30% of their total body mass. the livers effectiveness is limited, so sharks employ dynamic lift to maintain depth while swimming. sand tiger sharks store air in their stomachs, using it as a form of swim bladder.  bottom-dwelling sharks, like the nurse shark, have negative buoyancy, allowing them to rest on the ocean floor.some sharks, if inverted or stroked on the nose, enter a natural state of tonic immobility. researchers use this condition to handle sharks safely.like other fish, sharks extract oxygen from seawater as it passes over their gills. unlike other fish, shark gill slits are not covered, but lie in a row behind the head. a modified slit called a spiracle lies just behind the eye, which assists the shark with taking in water during respiration and plays a major role in bottom5 to 500 to 30 years. the spiny dogfish has one of the longest lifespans at more than 100 years. whale sharks  earlier estimates suggested the greenland shark unlike most bony fish, sharks are k-selected reproducers, meaning that they produce a small number of well-developed young as opposed to a large number of poorly developed young. fecundity in sharks ranges from 2 to over 100 young per reproductive cycle. sharks mature slowly relative to many other fish. for example, lemon sharks reach sexual maturity at around age 13016 a great white shark was captured on video for the first time in a state researchers believed was sleep swimming.most sharks are carnivorous. basking sharks, whale sharks, and megamouth sharks have independently evolved different strategies for filter feeding plankton: basking sharks practice ram feeding, whale sharks use suction to take in plankton and small fishes, and megamouth sharks make suction feeding more efficient by using the luminescent tissue inside of their mouths to attract prey in the deep ocean. this type of feeding requires gill rakers,000 metres in 2006 the international shark attack file contrary to popular belief, only a few sharks are dangerous to humans. out of more than 470 species, only four have been involved in a significant number of fatal, unprovoked attacks on humans: the great white, oceanic whitetip, tiger, and bull sharks. these sharks are large, powerful predators, and may sometimes attack and kill people. despite being responsible for attacks on humans they have all been filmed without using a protective cage.the perception of sharks as dangerous animals has been popularized by publicity given to a few isolated unprovoked attacks, such as the jersey shore shark attacks of 1916, and through popular fictional works about shark attacks, such as the jaws film series. jaws author peter benchley, as well as jaws director steven spielberg, later attempted to dispel the image of sharks as man-eating monsters.to help avoid an unprovoked attack, humans should not wear jewelry or metal that is shiny and refrain from splashing around too much.in general, sharks show little pattern of attacking humans specifically. research indicates that when humans do become the object of a shark attack, it is possible that the shark has mistaken the human for species that are its normal prey, such as seals.until recently, only a few benthic species of shark, such as hornsharks, leopard sharks and catsharks, had survived in aquarium conditions for a year or more. this gave rise to the belief that sharks, as well as being difficult to capture and transport, were difficult to care for. more knowledge has led to more species  the great white shark had never been successfully held in captivity for long periods of time until september 2004, when the monterey bay aquarium successfully kept a young female for 198 days before releasing her.most species are not suitable for home aquaria, and not every species sold by pet stores are appropriate. some species can flourish in home saltwater aquaria. uninformed or unscrupulous dealers sometimes sell juvenile sharks like the nurse shark, which upon reaching adulthood is far too large for typical home aquaria. public aquaria generally do not accept donated specimens that have outgrown their housing. some owners have been tempted to release them. species appropriate to home aquaria represent considerable spatial and financial investments as they generally approach adult lengths of 3 feet sharks figure prominently in hawaiian mythology. stories tell of men with shark jaws on their back who could change between shark and human form. a common theme was that a shark-man would warn beach-goers of sharks in the waters. the beach-goers would laugh and ignore the warnings and get eaten by the shark-man who warned them. hawaiian mythology also includes many shark gods. among a fishing people, the most popular of all aumakua, or deified ancestor guardians, are shark aumakua. kamaku describes in detail how to offer a corpse to become a shark. the body transforms gradually until the kahuna can point the awe-struck family to the markings on the sharks body that correspond to the clothing in which the beloveds body had been wrapped. such a shark aumakua becomes the family pet, receiving food, and driving fish into the family net and warding off danger. like all aumakua it had evil uses such as helping kill enemies. the ruling chiefs typically forbade such sorcery. many native hawaiian families claim such an aumakua, who is known by name to the whole community.kamohoalii is the best known and revered of the shark gods, he was the older and favored brother of pele, and helped and journeyed with her to hawaii. he was able to assume all human and fish forms. a summit cliff on the crater of kilauea is one of his most sacred spots. at one point he had a heiau  in fijian mythology, dakuwaqa was a shark god who was the eater of lost souls.on the island of tutuila in american samoa  according to the u.s. national park service, ""villagers from nearby vaitogi continue to reenact an important aspect of the legend at turtle and shark by performing a ritual song intended to summon the legendary animals to the ocean surface, and visitors are frequently amazed to see one or both of these creatures emerge from the sea in apparent response to this call.""in contrast to the complex portrayals by hawaiians and other pacific islanders, the european and western view of sharks has historically been mostly of fear and malevolence. sharks are used in popular culture commonly as eating machines, notably in the jaws novel and the film of the same name, along with its sequels. sharks are threats in other films such as deep blue sea, the reef, and others, although they are sometimes used for comedic effect such as in finding nemo and the austin powers series. sharks tend to be seen quite often in cartoons whenever a scene involves the ocean. such examples include the tom and jerry cartoons, jabberjaw, and other shows produced by hanna-barbera. they also are used commonly as a clich000, and 1.41 million tons for 2010. based on an analysis of average shark weights, this translates into a total annual mortality estimate of about 100 million sharks in 2000, and about 97 million sharks in 2010, with a total range of possible values between 63 and 273 million sharks per year. sharks are a common seafood in many places, including japan and australia. in the australian state of victoria, shark is the most commonly used fish in fish and chips, in which fillets are battered and deep-fried or crumbed and grilled. in fish and chip shops, shark is called flake. in india, small sharks or baby sharks  during a four-year period from 1996 to 2000, an estimated 26 to 73 million sharks were killed and traded annually in commercial markets.sharks are often killed for shark fin soup. fishermen capture live sharks, fin them, and dump the finless animal back into the water. shark finning involves removing the fin with a hot metal blade. the resulting immobile shark soon dies from suffocation or predators. shark fin has become a major trade within black markets all over the world. fins sell for about $300/lb in 2009. poachers illegally fin millions each year. few governments enforce laws that protect them. in 2010 hawaii became the first u.s. state to prohibit the possession, sale, trade or distribution of shark fins. from 1996 to 2000, an estimated 38 million sharks had been killed per year for harvesting shark fins. it is estimated by traffic that over 14,000 tonnes of shark fins were exported into singapore between 2005007 and 2012014.shark fin soup is a status symbol in asian countries and is erroneously considered healthy and full of nutrients. scientific research has revealed, however, that high concentrations of bmaa are present in shark fins. because bmaa is a neurotoxin, consumption of shark fin soup and cartilage pills, therefore, may pose a health risk. bmaa is under study for its pathological role in neurodegegerative diseases such as, als, alzheimers disease, and parkinsons disease.sharks are also killed for meat. european diners consume dogfishes, smoothhounds, catsharks, makos, porbeagle and also skates and rays. however, the u.s. fda lists sharks as one of four fish  capture-induced parturition is rarely considered in fisheries management despite being shown to occur in at least 12% of live bearing sharks and rays the majority of shark fisheries have little monitoring or management. the rise in demand for shark products increases pressure on fisheries. major declines in shark stocks have been recorded05 species were classified as critically endangered.in 2014, a shark cull in western australia killed dozens of sharks  until it was cancelled after public protests and a decision by the western australia epa; from 2014 to 2017, there was an ""imminent threat"" policy in western australia in which sharks that ""threatened"" humans in the ocean were shot and killed. this ""imminent threat"" policy was criticized by senator rachel siewart for killing endangered sharks. the ""imminent threat"" policy was cancelled in march 2017. in august 2018, the western australia government announced a plan to re-introduce drum lines from 1962 to the present, the government of queensland has targeted and killed sharks in large numbers by using drum lines, under a ""shark control"" program001 to 2018, a total of 10,480 sharks were killed on lethal drum lines in queensland, including in the great barrier reef. from 1962 to 2018, roughly 50,000 sharks were killed by queensland authorities.the government of new south wales has a program that deliberately kills sharks using nets. the current net program in new south wales has been described as being ""extremely destructive"" to marine life, including sharks. between 1950 and 2008, 352 tiger sharks and 577 great white sharks were killed in the nets in new south wales ,211 turtles, 8,448 rays, and 2,310 dolphins were killed in kwazulu-natal. authorities on the french island of r007 documentary sharkwater exposed how sharks are being hunted to extinction.in 1991, south africa was the first country in the world to declare great white sharks a legally protected species intending to ban the practice of shark finning while at sea, the united states congress passed the shark finning prohibition act in 2000.  two years later the act saw its first legal challenge in united states v. approximately 64,695 pounds of shark fins.  in 2008 a federal appeals court ruled that a loophole in the law allowed non-fishing vessels to purchase shark fins from fishing vessels while on the high seas.  seeking to close the loophole, the shark conservation act was passed by congress in december 2010, and it was signed into law in january 2011.in 2003, the european union introduced a general shark finning ban for all vessels of all nationalities in union waters and for all vessels flying a flag of one of its member states. this prohibition was amended in june 2013 to close remaining loopholes.in 2009, the international union for conservation of natures iucn red list of endangered species named 64 species, one-third of all oceanic shark species, as being at risk of extinction due to fishing and shark finning.in 2010, the convention on international trade in endangered species  in march 2013, three endangered commercially valuable sharks, the hammerheads, the oceanic whitetip and porbeagle were added to appendix 2 of cites, bringing shark fishing and commerce of these species under licensing and regulation.in 2010, greenpeace international added the school shark, shortfin mako shark, mackerel shark, tiger shark and spiny dogfish to its seafood red list, a list of common supermarket fish that are often sourced from unsustainable fisheries. advocacy group shark trust campaigns to limit shark fishing. advocacy group seafood watch directs american consumers to not eat sharks.under the auspices of the convention on the conservation of migratory species of wild animals in the united states, and as of january 16, 2019, 12 states including several regions now have shark sanctuaries or have banned shark fishing 020 researchers reported to have traced the origins of shark fins of endangered hammerhead sharks from a retail market in hong kong back to their source populations and therefore the approximate locations where the sharks were first caught using dna analysis.in july 2020 scientists reported results of a survey of 371 reefs in 58 nations estimating the conservation status of reef sharks globally. no sharks have been observed on almost 20% of the surveyed reefs and shark depletion was strongly associated with both socio-economic conditions and conservation measures. sharks are considered to be a vital part of the ocean ecosystem.",1,0
"asia-pacificmediterranean and middle eastother campaignscoupsworld war2 to 1925, the fascist movement led by benito mussolini seized power in italy with a nationalist, totalitarian, and class collaborationist agenda that abolished representative democracy, repressed socialist, left-wing and liberal forces, and pursued an aggressive expansionist foreign policy aimed at making italy a world power, and promising the creation of a ""new roman empire"".adolf hitler, after an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the german government in 1923, eventually became the chancellor of germany in 1933. he abolished democracy, espousing a radical, racially motivated revision of the world order, and soon began a massive rearmament campaign. meanwhile, france, to secure its alliance, allowed italy a free hand in ethiopia, which italy desired as a colonial possession. the situation was aggravated in early 1935 when the territory of the saar basin was legally reunited with germany, and hitler repudiated the treaty of versailles, accelerated his rearmament programme, and introduced conscription.the united kingdom, france and italy formed the stresa front in april 1935 in order to contain germany, a key step towards military globalisation; however, that june, the united kingdom made an independent naval agreement with germany, easing prior restrictions. the soviet union, concerned by germanys goals of capturing vast areas of eastern europe, drafted a treaty of mutual assistance with france. before taking effect, though, the franco-soviet pact was required to go through the bureaucracy of the league of nations, which rendered it essentially toothless. the united states, concerned with events in europe and asia, passed the neutrality act in august of the same year.hitler defied the versailles and locarno treaties by remilitarising the rhineland in march 1936, encountering little opposition due to the policy of appeasement. in october 1936, germany and italy formed the rome0 aircraft. the soviet union supported the existing government, the spanish republic. more than 30,000 foreign volunteers, known as the international brigades, also fought against the nationalists. both germany and the soviet union used this proxy war as an opportunity to test in combat their most advanced weapons and tactics. the nationalists won the civil war in april 1939; franco, now dictator, remained officially neutral during world war0 march 1939, forcing the concession of the klaip3 august, when tripartite negotiations about a military alliance between france, the united kingdom and soviet union stalled, the soviet union signed a non-aggression pact with germany. this pact had a secret protocol that defined german and soviet ""spheres of influence""  the pact neutralised the possibility of soviet opposition to a campaign against poland and assured that germany would not have to face the prospect of a two-front war, as it had in world war6 august, but upon hearing that the united kingdom had concluded a formal mutual assistance pact with poland and that italy would maintain neutrality, he decided to delay it.in response to british requests for direct negotiations to avoid war, germany made demands on poland, which only served as a pretext to worsen relations. on 29 august, hitler demanded that a polish plenipotentiary immediately travel to berlin to negotiate the handover of danzig, and to allow a plebiscite in the polish corridor in which the german minority would vote on secession. the poles refused to comply with the german demands, and on the night of 307 september, the warsaw garrison surrendered to the germans, and the last large operational unit of the polish army surrendered on 672 june 1941, germany, supported by italy and romania, invaded the soviet union in operation barbarossa, with germany accusing the soviets of plotting against them. they were joined shortly by finland and hungary. the primary targets of this surprise offensive were the baltic region, moscow and ukraine, with the ultimate goal of ending the 1941 campaign near the arkhangelsk-astrakhan line, from the caspian to the white seas. hitlers objectives were to eliminate the soviet union as a military power, exterminate communism, generate lebensraum  by dispossessing the native population and guarantee access to the strategic resources needed to defeat germanys remaining rivals.although the red army was preparing for strategic counter-offensives before the war, barbarossa forced the soviet supreme command to adopt a strategic defence. during the summer, the axis made significant gains into soviet territory, inflicting immense losses in both personnel and materiel. by mid-august, however, the german army high command decided to suspend the offensive of a considerably depleted army group centre, and to divert the 2nd panzer group to reinforce troops advancing towards central ukraine and leningrad. the kiev offensive was overwhelmingly successful, resulting in encirclement and elimination of four soviet armies, and made possible further advance into crimea and industrially developed eastern ukraine the diversion of three quarters of the axis troops and the majority of their air forces from france and the central mediterranean to the eastern front prompted the united kingdom to reconsider its grand strategy. in july, the uk and the soviet union formed a military alliance against germany and in august, the united kingdom and the united states jointly issued the atlantic charter, which outlined british and american goals for the postwar world. in late august the british and soviets invaded neutral iran to secure the persian corridor, irans oil fields, and preempt any axis advances through iran toward the baku oil fields or british india.by october axis operational objectives in ukraine and the baltic region were achieved, with only the sieges of leningrad and sevastopol continuing. a major offensive against moscow was renewed; after two months of fierce battles in increasingly harsh weather, the german army almost reached the outer suburbs of moscow, where the exhausted troops were forced to suspend their offensive. large territorial gains were made by axis forces, but their campaign had failed to achieve its main objectives: two key cities remained in soviet hands, the soviet capability to resist was not broken, and the soviet union retained a considerable part of its military potential. the blitzkrieg phase of the war in europe had ended.by early december, freshly mobilised reserves allowed the soviets to achieve numerical parity with axis troops. this, as well as intelligence data which established that a minimal number of soviet troops in the east would be sufficient to deter any attack by the japanese kwantung army, allowed the soviets to begin a massive counter-offensive that started on 5 december all along the front and pushed german troops 10050 kilometres following the japanese false flag mukden incident in 1931, the japanese shelling of the american gunboat uss panay in 1937, and the 1937-38 nanjing massacre japanese-american relations deteriorated. in 1939, the united states notified japan that it would not be extending its trade treaty and american public opinion opposing japanese expansionism led to a series of economic sanctions, the export control acts, which banned u.s. exports of chemicals, minerals and military parts to japan and increased economic pressure on the japanese regime. during 1939 japan launched its first attack against changsha, a strategically important chinese city, but was repulsed by late september. despite several offensives by both sides, the war between china and japan was stalemated by 1940. to increase pressure on china by blocking supply routes, and to better position japanese forces in the event of a war with the western powers, japan invaded and occupied northern indochina in september 1940.chinese nationalist forces launched a large-scale counter-offensive in early 1940. in august, chinese communists launched an offensive in central china; in retaliation, japan instituted harsh measures in occupied areas to reduce human and material resources for the communists. the continued antipathy between chinese communist and nationalist forces culminated in armed clashes in january 1941, effectively ending their co-operation. in march, the japanese 11th army attacked the headquarters of the chinese 19th army but was repulsed during battle of shanggao. in september, japan attempted to take the city of changsha again and clashed with chinese nationalist forces.german successes in europe encouraged japan to increase pressure on european governments in southeast asia. the dutch government agreed to provide japan with some oil supplies from the dutch east indies, but negotiations for additional access to their resources ended in failure in june 1941. in july 1941 japan sent troops to southern indochina, thus threatening british and dutch possessions in the far east. the united states, the united kingdom, and other western governments reacted to this move with a freeze on japanese assets and a total oil embargo. at the same time, japan was planning an invasion of the soviet far east, intending to capitalise off the german invasion in the west, but abandoned the operation after the sanctions.since early 1941 the united states and japan had been engaged in negotiations in an attempt to improve their strained relations and end the war in china. during these negotiations, japan advanced a number of proposals which were dismissed by the americans as inadequate. at the same time the united states, the united kingdom, and the netherlands engaged in secret discussions for the joint defence of their territories, in the event of a japanese attack against any of them. roosevelt reinforced the philippines frustrated at the lack of progress and feeling the pinch of the american0 november, a new government under hideki tojo presented an interim proposal as its final offer. it called for the end of american aid to china and for lifting the embargo on the supply of oil and other resources to japan. in exchange, japan promised not to launch any attacks in southeast asia and to withdraw its forces from southern indochina. the american counter-proposal of 26 november required that japan evacuate all of china without conditions and conclude non-aggression pacts with all pacific powers. that meant japan was essentially forced to choose between abandoning its ambitions in china, or seizing the natural resources it needed in the dutch east indies by force; the japanese military did not consider the former an option, and many officers considered the oil embargo an unspoken declaration of war.japan planned to rapidly seize european colonies in asia to create a large defensive perimeter stretching into the central pacific. the japanese would then be free to exploit the resources of southeast asia while exhausting the over-stretched allies by fighting a defensive war. to prevent american intervention while securing the perimeter, it was further planned to neutralise the united states pacific fleet and the american military presence in the philippines from the outset. on 7 december 1941  these included an attack on the american fleets at pearl harbor and the philippines, guam, wake island, landings in malaya, thailand and the battle of hong kong.the japanese invasion of thailand led to thailands decision to ally itself with japan and the other japanese attacks led the united states, united kingdom, china, australia, and several other states to formally declare war on japan, whereas the soviet union, being heavily involved in large-scale hostilities with european axis countries, maintained its neutrality agreement with japan. germany, followed by the other axis states, declared war on the united states in solidarity with japan, citing as justification the american attacks on german war vessels that had been ordered by roosevelt.on 1 january 1942, the allied big four2 smaller or exiled governments issued the declaration by united nations, thereby affirming the atlantic charter, and agreeing not to sign a separate peace with the axis powers.during 1942, allied officials debated on the appropriate grand strategy to pursue. all agreed that defeating germany was the primary objective. the americans favoured a straightforward, large-scale attack on germany through france. the soviets were also demanding a second front. the british, on the other hand, argued that military operations should target peripheral areas to wear out german strength, leading to increasing demoralisation, and bolster resistance forces. germany itself would be subject to a heavy bombing campaign. an offensive against germany would then be launched primarily by allied armour without using large-scale armies. eventually, the british persuaded the americans that a landing in france was infeasible in 1942 and they should instead focus on driving the axis out of north africa.at the casablanca conference in early 1943, the allies reiterated the statements issued in the 1942 declaration and demanded the unconditional surrender of their enemies. the british and americans agreed to continue to press the initiative in the mediterranean by invading sicily to fully secure the mediterranean supply routes. although the british argued for further operations in the balkans to bring turkey into the war, in may 1943, the americans extracted a british commitment to limit allied operations in the mediterranean to an invasion of the italian mainland and to invade france in 1944.by the end of april 1942, japan and its ally thailand had almost fully conquered burma, malaya, the dutch east indies, singapore, and rabaul, inflicting severe losses on allied troops and taking a large number of prisoners. despite stubborn resistance by filipino and us forces, the philippine commonwealth was eventually captured in may 1942, forcing its government into exile. on 16 april, in burma, 7,000 british soldiers were encircled by the japanese 33rd division during the battle of yenangyaung and rescued by the chinese 38th division. japanese forces also achieved naval victories in the south china sea, java sea and indian ocean, and bombed the allied naval base at darwin, australia. in january 1942, the only allied success against japan was a chinese victory at changsha. these easy victories over the unprepared us and european opponents left japan overconfident, as well as overextended.in early may 1942, japan initiated operations to capture port moresby by amphibious assault and thus sever communications and supply lines between the united states and australia. the planned invasion was thwarted when an allied task force, centred on two american fleet carriers, fought japanese naval forces to a draw in the battle of the coral sea. japans next plan, motivated by the earlier doolittle raid, was to seize midway atoll and lure american carriers into battle to be eliminated; as a diversion, japan would also send forces to occupy the aleutian islands in alaska. in mid-may, japan started the zhejiang-jiangxi campaign in china, with the goal of inflicting retribution on the chinese who aided the surviving american airmen in the doolittle raid by destroying air bases and fighting against the chinese 23rd and 32nd army groups. in early june, japan put its operations into action, but the americans, having broken japanese naval codes in late may, were fully aware of the plans and order of battle, and used this knowledge to achieve a decisive victory at midway over the imperial japanese navy.with its capacity for aggressive action greatly diminished as a result of the midway battle, japan chose to focus on a belated attempt to capture port moresby by an overland campaign in the territory of papua. the americans planned a counter-attack against japanese positions in the southern solomon islands, primarily guadalcanal, as a first step towards capturing rabaul, the main japanese base in southeast asia.both plans started in july, but by mid-september, the battle for guadalcanal took priority for the japanese, and troops in new guinea were ordered to withdraw from the port moresby area to the northern part of the island, where they faced australian and united states troops in the battle of buna, went disastrously, forcing a retreat back to india by may 1943. the second was the insertion of irregular forces behind japanese front-lines in february which, by the end of april, had achieved mixed results.despite considerable losses, in early 1942 germany and its allies stopped a major soviet offensive in central and southern russia, keeping most territorial gains they had achieved during the previous year. in may the germans defeated soviet offensives in the kerch peninsula and at kharkov, and then launched their main summer offensive against southern russia in june 1942, to seize the oil fields of the caucasus and occupy the kuban steppe, while maintaining positions on the northern and central areas of the front. the germans split army group south into two groups: army group a advanced to the lower don river and struck south-east to the caucasus, while army group b headed towards the volga river. the soviets decided to make their stand at stalingrad on the volga.by mid-november, the germans had nearly taken stalingrad in bitter street fighting. the soviets began their second winter counter-offensive, starting with an encirclement of german forces at stalingrad, and an assault on the rzhev salient near moscow, though the latter failed disastrously. by early february 1943, the german army had taken tremendous losses; german troops at stalingrad had been defeated, and the front-line had been pushed back beyond its position before the summer offensive. in mid-february, after the soviet push had tapered off, the germans launched another attack on kharkov, creating a salient in their front line around the soviet city of kursk.exploiting poor american naval command decisions, the german navy ravaged allied shipping off the american atlantic coast. by november 1941, commonwealth forces had launched a counter-offensive, operation crusader, in north africa, and reclaimed all the gains the germans and italians had made. in north africa, the germans launched an offensive in january, pushing the british back to positions at the gazala line by early february, followed by a temporary lull in combat which germany used to prepare for their upcoming offensives. concerns the japanese might use bases in vichy-held madagascar caused the british to invade the island in early may 1942. an axis offensive in libya forced an allied retreat deep inside egypt until axis forces were stopped at el alamein. on the continent, raids of allied commandos on strategic targets, culminating in the disastrous dieppe raid, demonstrated the western allies inability to launch an invasion of continental europe without much better preparation, equipment, and operational security.in august 1942, the allies succeeded in repelling a second attack against el alamein and, at a high cost, managed to deliver desperately needed supplies to the besieged malta. a few months later, the allies commenced an attack of their own in egypt, dislodging the axis forces and beginning a drive west across libya. this attack was followed up shortly after by anglo-american landings in french north africa, which resulted in the region joining the allies. hitler responded to the french colonys defection by ordering the occupation of vichy france; although vichy forces did not resist this violation of the armistice, they managed to scuttle their fleet to prevent its capture by german forces. the axis forces in africa withdrew into tunisia, which was conquered by the allies in may 1943.in june 1943 the british and americans began a strategic bombing campaign against germany with a goal to disrupt the war economy, reduce morale, and ""de-house"" the civilian population. the firebombing of hamburg was among the first attacks in this campaign, inflicting significant casualties and considerable losses on infrastructure of this important industrial centre.after the guadalcanal campaign, the allies initiated several operations against japan in the pacific. in may 1943, canadian and us forces were sent to eliminate japanese forces from the aleutians. soon after, the united states, with support from australia, new zealand and pacific islander forces, began major ground, sea and air operations to isolate rabaul by capturing surrounding islands, and breach the japanese central pacific perimeter at the gilbert and marshall islands. by the end of march 1944, the allies had completed both of these objectives and had also neutralised the major japanese base at truk in the caroline islands. in april, the allies launched an operation to retake western new guinea.in the soviet union, both the germans and the soviets spent the spring and early summer of 1943 preparing for large offensives in central russia. on 4 july 1943, germany attacked soviet forces around the kursk bulge. within a week, german forces had exhausted themselves against the soviets deeply echeloned and well-constructed defences, and for the first time in the war hitler cancelled the operation before it had achieved tactical or operational success. this decision was partially affected by the western allies invasion of sicily launched on 9 july, which, combined with previous italian failures, resulted in the ousting and arrest of mussolini later that month.on 12 july 1943, the soviets launched their own counter-offensives, thereby dispelling any chance of german victory or even stalemate in the east. the soviet victory at kursk marked the end of german superiority, giving the soviet union the initiative on the eastern front. the germans tried to stabilise their eastern front along the hastily fortified panther7 january 1944, soviet troops launched a major offensive that expelled german forces from the leningrad region, thereby ending the most lethal siege in history. the following soviet offensive was halted on the pre-war estonian border by the german army group north aided by estonians hoping to re-establish national independence. this delay slowed subsequent soviet operations in the baltic sea region. by late may 1944, the soviets had liberated crimea, largely expelled axis forces from ukraine, and made incursions into romania, which were repulsed by the axis troops. the allied offensives in italy had succeeded and, at the expense of allowing several german divisions to retreat, on 4 june rome was captured.the allies had mixed success in mainland asia. in march 1944, the japanese launched the first of two invasions, an operation against british positions in assam, india, and soon besieged commonwealth positions at imphal and kohima. in may 1944, british forces mounted a counter-offensive that drove japanese troops back to burma by july, and chinese forces that had invaded northern burma in late 1943 besieged japanese troops in myitkyina. the second japanese invasion of china aimed to destroy chinas main fighting forces, secure railways between japanese-held territory and capture allied airfields. by june, the japanese had conquered the province of henan and begun a new attack on changsha.on 6 june 1944  the western allies invaded northern france. after reassigning several allied divisions from italy, they also attacked southern france. these landings were successful and led to the defeat of the german army units in france. paris was liberated on 25 august by the local resistance assisted by the free french forces, both led by general charles de gaulle, and the western allies continued to push back german forces in western europe during the latter part of the year. an attempt to advance into northern germany spearheaded by a major airborne operation in the netherlands failed. after that, the western allies slowly pushed into germany, but failed to cross the rur river in a large offensive. in italy, allied advance also slowed due to the last major german defensive line.on 22 june, the soviets launched a strategic offensive in belarus  soon after that, another soviet strategic offensive forced german troops from western ukraine and eastern poland. the soviets formed the polish committee of national liberation to control territory in poland and combat the polish armia krajowa; the soviet red army remained in the praga district on the other side of the vistula and watched passively as the germans quelled the warsaw uprising initiated by the armia krajowa. the national uprising in slovakia was also quelled by the germans. the soviet red armys strategic offensive in eastern romania cut off and destroyed the considerable german troops there and triggered a successful coup d0 october. a few days later, the soviets launched a massive assault against german-occupied hungary that lasted until the fall of budapest in february 1945. unlike impressive soviet victories in the balkans, bitter finnish resistance to the soviet offensive in the karelian isthmus denied the soviets occupation of finland and led to a soviet-finnish armistice on relatively mild conditions, although finland was forced to fight their former ally germany.by the start of july 1944, commonwealth forces in southeast asia had repelled the japanese sieges in assam, pushing the japanese back to the chindwin river while the chinese captured myitkyina. in september 1944, chinese forces captured mount song and reopened the burma road. in china, the japanese had more successes, having finally captured changsha in mid-june and the city of hengyang by early august. soon after, they invaded the province of guangxi, winning major engagements against chinese forces at guilin and liuzhou by the end of november and successfully linking up their forces in china and indochina by mid-december.in the pacific, us forces continued to press back the japanese perimeter. in mid-june 1944, they began their offensive against the mariana and palau islands and decisively defeated japanese forces in the battle of the philippine sea. these defeats led to the resignation of the japanese prime minister, hideki tojo, and provided the united states with air bases to launch intensive heavy bomber attacks on the japanese home islands. in late october, american forces invaded the filipino island of leyte; soon after, allied naval forces scored another large victory in the battle of leyte gulf, one of the largest naval battles in history.on 16 december 1944, germany made a last attempt on the western front by using most of its remaining reserves to launch a massive counter-offensive in the ardennes and along with the french-german border to split the western allies, encircle large portions of western allied troops and capture their primary supply port at antwerp to prompt a political settlement. by january, the offensive had been repulsed with no strategic objectives fulfilled. in italy, the western allies remained stalemated at the german defensive line. in mid-january 1945, the soviets and poles attacked in poland, pushing from the vistula to the oder river in germany, and overran east prussia. on 4 february soviet, british, and us leaders met for the yalta conference. they agreed on the occupation of post-war germany, and on when the soviet union would join the war against japan.in february, the soviets entered silesia and pomerania, while western allies entered western germany and closed to the rhine river. by march, the western allies crossed the rhine north and south of the ruhr, encircling the german army group b. in early march, in an attempt to protect its last oil reserves in hungary and to retake budapest, germany launched its last major offensive against soviet troops near lake balaton. in two weeks, the offensive had been repulsed, the soviets advanced to vienna, and captured the city. in early april, soviet troops captured k5 april, leaving several unoccupied pockets in southern germany and around berlin.soviet and polish forces stormed and captured berlin in late april. in italy, german forces surrendered on 29 april. on 30 april, the reichstag was captured, signalling the military defeat of nazi germany, berlin garrison surrendered on 2 may.several changes in leadership occurred during this period. on 12 april, president roosevelt died and was succeeded by harry s. truman. benito mussolini was killed by italian partisans on 28 april. two days later, hitler committed suicide in besieged berlin, and he was succeeded by grand admiral karl d september 1945, ending the war.the allies established occupation administrations in austria and germany. the former became a neutral state, non-aligned with any political bloc. the latter was divided into western and eastern occupation zones controlled by the western allies and the soviet union. a denazification programme in germany led to the prosecution of nazi war criminals in the nuremberg trials and the removal of ex-nazis from power, although this policy moved towards amnesty and re-integration of ex-nazis into west german society.germany lost a quarter of its pre-war  and east prussia was divided between poland and the soviet union, followed by the expulsion to germany of the nine million germans from these provinces, as well as three million germans from the sudetenland in czechoslovakia. by the 1950s, one-fifth of west germans were refugees from the east. the soviet union also took over the polish provinces east of the curzon line, from which 2 million poles were expelled; north-east romania, parts of eastern finland, and the three baltic states were incorporated into the soviet union.in an effort to maintain world peace, the allies formed the united nations, which officially came into existence on 24 october 1945, and adopted the universal declaration of human rights in 1948 as a common standard for all member nations. the great powers that were the victors of the war.estimates for the total number of casualties in the war vary, because many deaths went unrecorded. most suggest that some 600 million military personnel and 40700,000 ethnic serbs, along with gypsies and jews, were persecuted and murdered by the axis-aligned croatian usta.72,000 polish officers, and the imprisonment or execution of thousands of political prisoners by the nkvd, along with mass civilian deportations to siberia, in the baltic states and eastern poland annexed by the red army.the mass bombing of cities in europe and asia has often been called a war crime, although no positive or specific customary international humanitarian law with respect to aerial warfare existed before or during world war26,127 were sent to the gulag as real or perceived nazi collaborators.japanese prisoner-of-war camps, many of which were used as labour camps, also had high death rates. the international military tribunal for the far east found the death rate of western prisoners was 27 per cent  seven times that of pows under the germans and italians. while 37,583 prisoners from the uk, 28,500 from the netherlands, and 14,473 from the united states were released after the surrender of japan, the number of chinese released was only 56.at least five million chinese civilians from northern china and manchukuo were enslaved between 1935 and 1941 by the east asia development board, or k, the number reached 10, after the united states and soviet union joined the allies, as the war largely settled into one of attrition. while the allies ability to out-produce the axis is often attributed to the allies having more access to natural resources, other factors, such as germany and japans reluctance to employ women in the labour force, allied strategic bombing, and germanys late shift to a war economy contributed significantly. additionally, neither germany nor japan planned to fight a protracted war, and had not equipped themselves to do so. to improve their production, germany and japan used millions of slave labourers; germany used about 12\xa0i. the portable machine gun spread, a notable example being the german mg34, and various submachine guns which were suited to close combat in urban and jungle settings. the assault rifle, a late war development incorporating many features of the rifle and submachine gun, became the standard postwar infantry weapon for most armed forces.most major belligerents attempted to solve the problems of complexity and security involved in using large codebooks for cryptography by designing ciphering machines, the most well known being the german enigma machine. development of sigint  and british ultra, a pioneering method for decoding enigma benefiting from information given to the united kingdom by the polish cipher bureau, which had been decoding early versions of enigma before the war. another aspect of military intelligence was the use of deception, which the allies used to great effect, such as in operations mincemeat and bodyguard.other technological and engineering feats achieved during, or as a result of, the war include the worlds first programmable computers  penicillin was first mass-produced and used during the war ",1,0
"reportedly haunted locations:a psychic is a person who claims to use extrasensory perception  some famous psychics include edgar cayce, ingo swann, peter hurkos, janet lee, jose ortiz el samaritano, miss cleo, john edward, sylvia browne, and tyler henry. psychic powers are asserted by psychic detectives and in practices such as psychic archaeology and even psychic surgery.critics attribute psychic powers to intentional trickery or to self-delusion. in 1988 the u.s. national academy of sciences gave a report on the subject and concluded there is ""no scientific justification from research conducted over a period of 130 years for the existence of parapsychological phenomena"". a study attempted to repeat recently reported parapsychological experiments that appeared to support the existence of precognition. attempts to repeat the results, which involved performance on a memory test to ascertain if post-test information would affect it, ""failed to produce significant effects"" and thus ""do not support the existence of psychic ability"" of this kind.psychics are sometimes featured in science fiction and fantasy fiction. examples of fiction featuring characters with psychic powers include the star wars franchise, which features ""force-sensitive"" beings that can see into the future and move objects telekinetically, along with dungeons & dragons and some of the works of stephen king, amongst many others.the word ""psychic"" is derived from the greek word psychikos french astronomer and spiritualist camille flammarion is credited as having first used the word psychic, while it was later introduced to the english language by edward william cox in the 1870s.elaborate systems of divination and fortune-telling date back to ancient times. perhaps the most widely known system of early civilization fortune-telling was astrology, where practitioners believed the relative positions of celestial bodies could lend insight into peoples lives and even predict their future circumstances. some fortune-tellers were said to be able to make predictions without the use of these elaborate systems  a number of examples are included in biblical accounts. the book of 1 samuel  the role of prophet appeared perennially in ancient cultures. in egypt, the priests of the sun deity ra at memphis acted as seers. in ancient assyria seers were referred to as nabu, meaning ""to call"" or ""announce"".the delphic oracle is one of the earliest stories in classical antiquity of prophetic abilities. the pythia, the priestess presiding over the oracle of apollo at delphi, was believed to be able to deliver prophecies inspired by apollo during rituals beginning in the 8th century bc. it is often said that the pythia delivered oracles in a frenzied state induced by vapors rising from the ground, and that she spoke gibberish, believed to be the voice of apollo, which priests reshaped into the enigmatic prophecies preserved in greek literature. other scholars believe records from the time indicate that the pythia spoke intelligibly, and gave prophecies in her own voice. the pythia was a position served by a succession of women probably selected from amongst a guild of priestesses of the temple. the last recorded response was given in 393 ad, when the emperor theodosius i ordered pagan temples to cease operation. recent geological investigations raise the possibility that ethylene gas caused the pythias state of inspiration.one of the most enduring historical references to what some consider to be psychic ability is the prophecies of michel de nostredame  as well as at least eleven annual calendars. most of the quatrains deal with disasters, such as plagues, earthquakes, wars, floods, invasions, murders, droughts, and battles % of respondents thought that extrasensory perception had been scientifically demonstrated, with another 2% thinking that the phenomena happened sometimes. asked about research in the field, 22% thought that it should be discouraged, 63% that it should be allowed but not encouraged, and 10% that it should be encouraged; neuroscientists were the most hostile to parapsychology of all the specialties.a survey of the beliefs of the general united states population about paranormal topics was conducted by the gallup organization in 2005. the survey found that 41 percent of those polled believed in extrasensory perception and 26 percent believed in clairvoyance. 31 percent of those surveyed indicated that they believe in telepathy or psychic communication.a poll of 439 college students conducted in 2006 by researchers bryan farha of oklahoma city university and gary steward of university of central oklahoma, suggested that college seniors and graduate students were more likely to believe in psychic phenomena than college freshmen. twenty-three percent of college freshmen expressed a belief in paranormal ideas. the percentage was greater among college seniors  the poll showed lower belief in psychic phenomena among science students than social science and education students.some people also believe that anyone can have psychic abilities which can be activated or enhanced through the study and practice of various disciplines and techniques such as meditation and divination, with a number of books and websites being dedicated to instruction in these methods. another popular belief is that psychic ability is hereditary, with a psychic parent passing their abilities on to their children.psychic abilities are common in science fiction, often under the term ""psionics"". they may be depicted as innate and heritable, as in alfred besters the demolished man, a. e. van vogts slan, anne mccaffreys talents universe series or setting, and the television series babylon 5. another recurring trope is the conveyance of psychic power through psychoactive drugs, as in the dune novels and indirectly in the scanners films, as well as the ghosts in the starcraft franchise. somewhat differently, in madeleine lengles a wind in the door and robert a. heinleins stranger in a strange land, psychic abilities may be achieved by any human who learns the proper mental discipline, known as kything in the former work. popular movies include the initiation of sarah. psychic characters are also common in superhero comics, for instance jean grey, professor x and emma frost as well as many others from the marvel comics x-men. more characters include the characters raven baxter and booker baxter from the disney channel original series thats so raven and its spin-off ravens home. the disney channel original series american dragon: jake long features recurring characters cara and sara, who are twin psychics claimed to be the descendants of the oracle of delphi, their visions also contrast their personalities critics such as ray hyman and the national science foundation suggest that parapsychology has methodological flaws that can explain the experimental results that parapsychologists attribute to paranormal explanations, and various critics have classed the field as pseudoscience. this has largely been due to lack of replication of results by independent experimenters.the evidence presented for psychic phenomena is not sufficiently verified for scientific acceptance, and there exist many non-paranormal alternative explanations for claimed instances of psychic events. parapsychologists, who generally believe that there is some evidence for psychic ability, disagree with critics who believe that no psychic ability exists and that many of the instances of more popular psychic phenomena such as mediumism, can be attributed to non-paranormal techniques such as cold reading, hot reading, or even self-delusion. cold reading techniques would include psychics using flattery, intentionally making descriptions, statements or predictions about a person vague and ambiguous, and surreptitiously moving on to another prediction when the psychic deems the audience to be non-responsive. magicians such as james randi, ian rowland and derren brown have demonstrated techniques and results similar to those of popular psychics, but they present physical and psychological explanations as opposed to paranormal ones.in january 2008 the results of a study using neuroimaging were published. to provide what are purported to be the most favorable experimental conditions, the study included appropriate emotional stimuli and had participants who are biologically or emotionally related, such as twins. the experiment was designed to produce positive results if telepathy, clairvoyance or precognition occurred, but despite this no distinguishable neuronal responses were found between psychic stimuli and non-psychic stimuli, while variations in the same stimuli showed anticipated effects on patterns of brain activation. the researchers concluded that ""these findings are the strongest evidence yet obtained against the existence of paranormal mental phenomena."" james alcock had cautioned the researchers against the wording of said statement.a detailed study of sylvia browne predictions about missing persons and murder cases has found that despite her repeated claims to be more than 85% correct, ""browne has not even been mostly correct in a single case"".  concerning the television psychics, james underdown states that testing psychics in a studio setting is difficult as there are too many areas to control: the psychic could be getting help from anyone on the set. the editor controls everything; they can make a psychic look superior or ridiculous depending on direction from the producer.  in an independent investigations group expos\xc3\xa9 of john edward and james van praagh they discovered that what was actually said on the tape day, and what was broadcast to the public were ""substantially different in the accuracy. theyre getting rid of the wrong guesses... once you pull back the curtain and see how its done, its not impressive at all.""skeptical activist susan gerbic has summarized a number of techniques, which she says are used by psychics to create their effects. media related to psychics

"jesus christ superstar is a 1970 rock opera with music by andrew lloyd webber and lyrics by tim rice. it started as a rock opera album musical before its broadway on-stage debut in 1971. the musical is sung-through, with no spoken dialogue. the story is loosely based on the gospels accounts of the last week of jesuss life, beginning with the preparation for the arrival of jesus and his disciples  in jerusalem and ending with the crucifixion. it depicts political and interpersonal struggles between judas iscariot and jesus that are not present in the bible.the works depiction offers a free interpretation of the psychology of jesus and other characters. much of the plot centres on judas, who is dissatisfied with the direction in which jesus is steering his disciples.contemporary attitudes, sensibilities and slang pervade the rock operas lyrics, and ironic allusions to modern life are scattered throughout the depiction of political events. stage and film productions accordingly contain many intentional anachronisms.by 1980, the musical had grossed more than $237 million worldwide.judas iscariot, one of the twelve apostles, worries that the followers of jesus are getting out of control and may be seen as a threat by the roman empire, who might harshly suppress them  he tells the mob that jesus has committed no crime and does not deserve to die, but to satisfy the mob he will have jesus flogged act oneact twothe songs were first written and conceived as an album musical, before the musical was created and staged. on the original album, the part of jesus was sung by ian gillan, with murray head as judas, michael dabo as king herod, yvonne elliman as mary magdalene, and barry dennen as pilate. in july 1971, the first authorised american concert of the rock opera took place in front of an audience of 13,000 people at pittsburgh, pennsylvanias civic arena with jeff fenholt singing the role of jesus, carl anderson as judas and elliman repeating as mary magdalene.the musical opened on broadway on 12 october 1971, directed by tom ohorgan, at the mark hellinger theatre. it starred jeff fenholt as jesus, ben vereen as judas and bob bingham as caiaphas. dennen and elliman played the roles that they had sung on the album. kurt yaghjian was annas. anderson replaced vereen when he fell ill, and the two performers later took turns playing the role. the show closed on 30 june 1973 after 711 performances. the production received mixed reviews; the bold casting of african-americans as judas was lauded, but reviewer clive barnes from the new york times said, ""the real disappointment was not in the music ... but in the conception.""  the show was nominated for five tony awards, including best score, but won none. lloyd webber won a drama desk award as ""most promising composer"", and vereen won a theatre world award.the broadway show and subsequent productions were condemned by some religious groups. tim rice was quoted as saying ""it happens that we dont see christ as god but simply the right man at the right time at the right place."" some christians considered such comments to be blasphemous, the character of judas too sympathetic and some of his criticisms of jesus offensive. the musicals lack of allusion to the resurrection of jesus has resulted in criticism similar to that of fellow musical godspell, which also did not clearly depict the resurrection.at the same time, some jews claimed that it bolstered the antisemitic belief that the jews were responsible for jesuss death by showing most of the villains as jewish  the musical was banned in south africa for being ""irreligious"". a 1972 production of the play was banned in the hungarian peoples republic for ""distribution of religious propaganda"".superstar opened at the palace theatre in london in 1972, starring paul nicholas as jesus, stephen tate as judas and dana gillespie as mary magdalene. it was directed by australian jim sharman. this production was

magdalene and chris moyles as king herod. lloyd webber stated, ""the funny thing is that jesus christ superstar  is what we actually intended it to be. when it is done in a conventional proscenium theatre production it feels shoe-horned in. that is why i wanted to do this."" the tour resumed in march 2013 in the uk, and an australian leg of the tour commenced in perth in may 2013. andrew okeefe played king herod in australia, with jon stevens as pilate. stevens had played judas in an australian arena tour in 1992.in 2016, celebrating 45 years since the musical debuted on broadway, jesus

rappers common, mos def and talib kweli, has been credited as a pioneer of the conscious hip hop movement, which focuses on social issues.  subjects touched upon on lupe fiascos food & liquor include absent parents, terrorism, islam and religion, war, and prostitution.  fiasco attributes his interest in social issues to his highly cultured upbringing, as he describes his mother as ""very intellectual"" and his father as a ""renaissance man"".  he rejects the misogyny common in hip hop, which he discusses in the song ""hurt me soul"".  despite this, fiasco is strongly opposed to censorship in music: ""if were going to  that are offensive, then we are going to have to blind and deafen everyone. come on, man. lets focus on education and literacy and poverty.""fiasco employs various lyrical techniques in his songwriting.  the rapper views hip-hop as a medium conducive to storytelling, a primary element of his lyrics due to his background in theater.  he wrote plays as a child, which had a strong effect on his songwriting approaches.  fiasco utilizes both metaphors and literal statements in his work, which he describes as ""getting from point a to point b in as few words as possible"".  his use of metaphors is exemplified by the song ""gotta eat"" from lupe fiascos the cool, which is told from the perspective of a cheeseburger and addresses the poor nutrition in black communities in the united states, while using a continuous metaphor of drug dealing and hustling.in 2001, fiasco co-founded 1st & 15th entertainment with charles ""chilly"" patton. 1st & 15th is an independent record label separate from atlantic records named after the traditional twice-monthly paycheck dates.  although his albums are released by atlantic since he is under contract with it,

disaster.016, defeating him 3-2 using ken.lupe fiasco has stated on mtvs rap fix, as well as in various other media, that he is muslim and that islam ""plays a part in my life and everything i do, to a certain extent... i dont like putting my religion out there, i dont like wearing it like that, because i dont want people to look at me as the poster child for islam. im not. i dont want them to

liquor. lupe fiasco has endorsed the idea that islam will some day ""be the worlds religion and conquer the world.""in an interview with stephen colbert on the satirical news show the colbert report, fiasco stated his credo on political philosophy: ""you should criticize power even if you agree with it."" in another interview in june 2011 on the cbs program whats trending, fiasco discussed the political content of his music, stating, ""my fight against terrorism, to me, the biggest terrorist is obama and the united states of america. im trying to fight the terrorism thats actually causing the other forms of terrorism. you know, the root cause of terrorism is the stuff the u.s. government allows to happen. the foreign policies that we have in place in different countries that inspire people to become terrorists."" he additionally criticized obama for his stance on the israeli018. he said on twitter that he now votes due to the racial views of donald trump, and that he generally votes for democratic candidates. on january 20, 2013, he was removed from the stage by the security for refusing to move onto the next song after performing a 30-minute version of ""words i never

"classical antiquity  comprising the interlocking civilizations of ancient greece and ancient rome known as the greco-roman world. it is the period in which both greek and roman societies flourished and wielded great influence throughout much of europe, northern africa, and west asia.conventionally, it is taken to begin with the earliest-recorded epic greek poetry of homer the culture of the ancient greeks, together with some influences from the ancient near east, was the basis of art, philosophy, society, and education, until the roman imperial period. the romans preserved, imitated, and spread this culture over europe, until they themselves were able to compete with it, and the classical world began to speak latin as well as greek.this greco-roman cultural foundation has been immensely influential on the language, politics, law, educational systems, philosophy, science, warfare, poetry, historiography, ethics, rhetoric, art and architecture of the modern world. surviving fragments of classical culture led to a revival beginning in the 14th century which later came to be known as the renaissance, and various neo-classical revivals occurred in the 18th and 19th centuries.the earliest period of classical antiquity takes place against the background of gradual re-appearance of historical sources following the bronze age collapse. the 8th and 7th centuries1 april 753 bc by twin descendants of the trojan prince aeneas, romulus and remus. as the city was bereft of women, legend says that the latins invited the sabines to a festival and stole their unmarried maidens, leading to the integration of the latins and the sabines.archaeological evidence indeed shows first traces of settlement at the roman forum in the mid-8th bc, though settlements on the palatine hill may date back to the 10th century bc.the seventh and final king of rome was tarquinius superbus. as the son of tarquinius priscus and the son-in-law of servius tullius, superbus was of etruscan birth. it was during his reign that the etruscans reached their apex of power. superbus removed and destroyed all the sabine shrines and altars from the tarpeian rock, enraging the people of rome. the people came to object to his rule when he failed to recognize the rape of lucretia, a patrician roman, at the hands of his own son. lucretias kinsman, lucius junius brutus the classical period of ancient greece corresponds to most of the 5th and 4th centuries39, and the conquest of much of the mediterranean by the new muslim faith from 634. the overthrow of maurice by his mutinying danube army under phocas resulted in the slavic invasion of the balkans and the decline of balkan and greek urban culture  greek and roman authorities such as hippocrates and galen formed the foundation of the practice of medicine even longer than greek thought prevailed in philosophy. in the french theater, tragedians such as moli\xc3\xa8re and racine wrote plays on mythological or classical historical subjects and subjected them to the strict rules of the classical unities derived from aristotles poetics. the desire to dance like a latter-day vision of how the ancient greeks did it moved isadora duncan to create her brand of ballet.",1,0
"a video game is an electronic game that involves interaction with a user interface or input device . today, video game development requires numerous skills to bring a game to market, including developers, publishers, distributors, retailers, console and other third-party manufacturers, and other roles.since the 2010s, the commercial importance of the video game industry has been increasing. the emerging asian markets and mobile games on smartphones in particular are driving the growth of the industry. as of 2018, video games generated sales of us$134.9 billion annually worldwide, and were the third-largest segment in the u.s. entertainment market, behind broadcast and cable tv.early games used interactive electronic devices with various display formats. the earliest example is from 19475 january 1947, by thomas t. goldsmith jr. and estle ray mann, and issued on 14 december 1948, as u.s. patent 2455992. inspired by radar display technology, it consisted of an analog device that allowed a user to control a vector-drawn dot on the screen to simulate a missile being fired at targets, which were drawings fixed to the screen. other early examples include: christopher stracheys draughts game, the nimrod computer at the 1951 festival of britain; oxo a tic-tac-toe computer game by alexander s. douglas for the edsac in 1952; tennis for two, an electronic interactive game engineered by william higinbotham in 1958; spacewar!, written by mit students martin graetz, steve russell, and wayne wiitanens on a dec pdp-1 computer in 1961; and the hit ping pong-style pong, a 1972 game by atari. each game used different means of display: nimrod used a panel of lights to play the game of nim, oxo used a graphical display to play tic-tac-toe tennis for two used an oscilloscope to display a side view of a tennis court, and spacewar! used the dec pdp-1s vector display to have two spaceships battle each other.these preliminary inventions paved the way for the origins of video games today. ralph h. baer, while working at sanders associates in 1966, came up with the idea of using a control system to play a rudimentary game of table tennis on a television screen. with sanders blessing, baer build out the prototype ""brown box"". sanders patented baers inventions and licensed them to magnavox, who commercialized it as the first home video game console, the magnavox odyssey, released in 1972. separately, nolan bushnell and ted dabney, inspired by seeing spacewar! running at stanford university, came up with the idea of creating a similar version running in a smaller cabinet using a less expensive computer with a coin-operated feature. this was released as computer space, the first arcade game, in 1971.  bushnell and dabney went on to form atari, inc., and with allan alcorn, created their second arcade game pong in 1972, which was directly inspired by the table tennis game on the odyssey. sanders and magnavox sued atari on patent infringement over baers patents, but atari settled out of court, paying for perpetual rights to the patents. following their agreement, atari went ahead with plans to make a home version of pong, while was released by christmas 1975. the success of the odyssey and pong, both as an arcade game and home machine, launched the video game industry. both baer and bushnell have been given the title the ""father of video games"" for their contributions.the term ""video game"" was developed to distinguish this class of electronic games that were played to some type of video display rather than those that used the output of a teletype printer or similar device.the first appearance of the term emerged around 1973. the oxford english dictionary cited a november 10, 1973 businessweek article as the first printed use of the term. while bushnell believed the term came out from a vending magazine review of computer space in 1971, a review of the major vending magazines vending times and cashbox showed that the term came much earlier, appearing first around march 1973 in these magazines in mass usage including by the arcade game manufacturers. as analyzed by video game historian keith smith, the sudden appearance suggested that the term had been suggested and readily adopted by those involved. this appeared to trace to ed adlum, who ran cashboxs coin-operated section until 1972 and then later founded replay magazine, covering the coin-op amusement field, in 1975. in a september 1982 issue of replay, adlum is credited with first naming these games as ""video games"": ""replays eddie adlum worked at cash box when tv games first came out. the personalities in those days were bushnell, his sales manager pat karns and a handful of other tv game manufacturers like henry leyser and the mcewan brothers. it seemed awkward to call their products tv games, so borrowing a word from billboards description of movie jukeboxes, adlum started to refer to this new breed of amusement machine as video games. the phrase stuck."" in japan, where consoles like the odyssey were first imported and then made within the country by the large television manufacturers such as toshiba and sharp corporation, these were also known as ""tv games"", or tv geemu or terebi geemu.as every video game is different, the experience of playing every video game is impossible to summarize in a singular statement, but many common elements exist. most games will launch into a title screen and give the player a chance to review options such as the number of players before starting a game. most games are divided into levels which the player must work their avatar through, scoring points, collecting power-ups to boost the avatars innate attributes, all while either using special attacks to defeat enemies or moves to avoid them. taking damage will deplete their avatars health, and if that falls to zero or if the avatar otherwise falls into an impossible-to-escape location, the player will lose one of their lifes. should they lose all their lives without gaining an extra life or ""1-up"", then the player will reach the ""game over"" screen. many levels as well as the games finale end with a type of boss character the player must defeat to continue on. in some games, intermediate points between levels will offer save points where the player can create a saved game on storage media to restart the game should they lose all their lives or need to stop the game and restart at a later time. these also may be in the form of a passage that can be written down and reentered at the title screen.as games are software products, they may still ship with software bugs. these can manifest as glitches within the game which may be exploited by the player; this is often the foundation of speedrunning a video game. other times, these bugs, along with cheat codes, easter eggs, and other hidden secrets that were intentionally added to the game can also be exploited. on some consoles, cheat cartridges allow players to execute these cheat codes, while user-developed trainers allow similar bypassing for computer software games, both which can make the game easier, give the player additional power-ups, or change the appearance of the game.video games require a platform, a specific combination of electronic components or computer hardware and associated software, to operate. the term system is also commonly used. games are typically designed to be played on one or a limited number of platforms, and exclusivity to a platform is used as a competitive edge in the video game market. the list below is not exhaustive and excludes other electronic devices capable of playing video games such as pdas and graphing calculators.early arcade games, home consoles, and handheld games were dedicated hardware units with the games logic built into the electronic componentry of the hardware. since then, most video game platforms have means to use multiple games distributed on different types of media or formats. physical formats include rom cartridges, magnetic storage including magnetic tape data storage and floppy discs, optical media formats including cd-rom and dvds, and flash memory cards. furthermore digital distribution over the internet or other communication methods as well as cloud gaming alleviate the need for any physical media. in some cases, the media serves as the direct read-only memory for the game, or it may be the form of installation media that is used to write the main assets to the players platforms local storage for faster loading periods and later updates.games can be extended with new content and software patches through either expansion packs which are typically available as physical media, or as downloadable content nominally available via digital distribution. these can be offered freely or can be used to monetize a game following its initial release. several games offer players the ability to create user-generated content to share with others to play. other games, mostly those on personal computers, can be extended with user-created modifications or mods that alter or add onto the game; these often are unofficial and were developed by players from reverse engineering of the game, but other games provide official support for modding the game.video game can use several types of input devices to translate human actions to a game. most common are the use of game controllers like gamepads and joysticks for most consoles. handheld consoles will have built in buttons and directional pads, similarly arcade games will have controls built into the console unit itself. many games on personal computers can take advantage of keyboard and mouse controls. other game controllers are commonly used for specific games like racing wheels, light guns or dance pads. digital cameras can also be used as game controllers capturing movements of the body of the player.as technology continues to advance, more can be added onto the controller to give the player a more immersive experience when playing different games. there are some controllers that have presets so that the buttons are mapped a certain way to make playing certain games easier. along with the presets, a player can sometimes custom map the buttons to better accommodate their play style. on keyboard and mouse, different actions in the game are already preset to keys on the keyboard. most games allow the player to change that so that the actions are mapped to different keys that are more to their liking. the companies that design the controllers are trying to make the controller visually appealing and also feel comfortable in the hands of the consumer.an example of a technology that was incorporated into the controller was the touchscreen. it allows the player to be able to interact with the game differently than before. the person could move around in menus easier and they are also able to interact with different objects in the game. they can pick up some objects, equip others, or even just move the objects out of the players path. another example is motion sensor where a persons movement is able to be captured and put into a game. some motion sensor games are based on where the controller is. the reason for that is because there is a signal that is sent from the controller to the console or computer so that the actions being done can create certain movements in the game. other type of motion sensor games are webcam style where the player moves around in front of it, and the actions are repeated by a game character.by definition, all video games are intended to output graphics to an external video display, such as cathode-ray tube televisions, newer liquid-crystal display  the narrative setting does not impact gameplay; a shooter game is still a shooter game, regardless of whether it takes place in a fantasy world or in outer space.genre names are normally self-describing in terms of the type of gameplay, such as action game, role playing game, or shoot em up, though some genres have derivations from influential works that have defined that genre, such as roguelikes from rogue, grand theft auto clones from grand theft auto iii, and battle royale game from the film battle royale. the names may shift over time as players, developers and the media come up with new terms; for example, first-person shooters were originally called ""doom clones"" based on the 1993 game. a hierarchy of game genres exist, with top-level genres like ""shooter game"" and ""action game"" that broadly capture the games main gameplay style, and several subgenres of specific implementation, such as within the shooter game first-person shooter and third-person shooter. some cross-genre types also exist that fall until multiple top-level genres such as action-adventure game.a video games mode describes how many players can use the game at the same type. this is primarily distinguished by single-player video games and multiplayer video games. within the latter category, multiplayer games can be played in a variety of ways, including locally at the same device, on separate devices connected through a local network such as lan parties, or online via separate internet connections. most multiplayer games are based on competitive gameplay, but many offer cooperative and team-based options as well as asymmetric gameplay. online games use server structures that can also enable massively multiplayer online games video game development and authorship, much like any other form of entertainment, is frequently a cross-disciplinary field. video game developers, as employees within this industry are commonly referred, primarily include programmers and graphic designers. over the years this has expanded to include almost every type of skill that one might see prevalent in the creation of any movie or television program, including sound designers, musicians, and other technicians; as well as skills that are specific to video games, such as the game designer. all of these are managed by producers.in the early days of the industry, it was more common for a single person to manage all of the roles needed to create a video game. as platforms have become more complex and powerful in the type of material they can present, larger teams have been needed to generate all of the art, programming, cinematography, and more. this is not to say that the age of the ""one-man shop"" is gone, as this is still sometimes found in the casual gaming and handheld markets, where smaller games are prevalent due to technical limitations such as limited ram or lack of dedicated 3d graphics rendering capabilities on the target platform video games are programmed like any other piece of computer software. early games required programming all parts of a game. today, game developers have a number of commercial and open source tools available for use to make games, often which are across multiple platforms to support portability, or may still opt to create their own for more specialized features and direct control of the game. today, many games are built around a game engine that handles the bulk of the games logic, gameplay, and rendering. these engines can be augmented with specialized engines for specific features, such as a physics engine that simulates the physics of objects in real-time. a variety of middleware exists to help developers to access other features, such as for playback of videos within games, network-oriented code for games that communicate via online services, matchmaking for online games, and similar features. these features can be used from a devlopers programming language of choice, or they may opt to also use game development kits that minimize the amount of direct programming they have to do but can also limit the amount of customization they can add into a game. like all software, video games usually undergo quality testing before release to assure there are no bugs or glitches in the product, though frequently developers will release patches and updates.with the growth of the size of development teams in the industry, the problem of cost has increased. development studios need to be able to pay their staff a competitive wage in order to attract and retain the best talent, while publishers are constantly looking to keep costs down in order to maintain profitability on their investment. typically, a video game console development team can range in sizes of anywhere from 5 to 50 people, with some teams exceeding 100. in may 2009, one game project was reported to have a development staff of 450. the growth of team size combined with greater pressure to get completed projects into the market to begin recouping production costs has led to a greater occurrence of missed deadlines, rushed games and the release of unfinished products.while amateur and hobbyist game programming had existing since the late 1970s with the introduction of home computers, a newer trend since the mid-2000s is indie game development. indie games are made by small teams outside any direct publisher control, their games being smaller in scope than those from the larger ""aaa"" game studios, and are often experiment in gameplay and art style. indie game development are aided by larger availability of digital distribution, including the newer mobile gaming marker, and readily-available and low-cost development tools for these platforms.video games have a large network effect that draw on many different sectors that tie into the larger video game industry. while video game developers are a significant portion of the industry, other key participants in the market include:according to the market research firm superdata, as of may 2015, the global games market was worth us$74.2 billion. by region, north america accounted for $23.6 billion, asia for $23.1 billion, europe for $22.1 billion and south america for $4.5 billion. by market segment, mobile games were worth $22.3 billion, retail games 19.7 billion, free-to-play mmos 8.7 billion, social games $7.9 billion, pc dlc 7.5 billion, and other categories $3 billion or less each.in the united states, also according to superdata, the share of video games in the entertainment market grew from 5% in 1985 to 13% in 2015, becoming the third-largest market segment behind broadcast and cable television. the research firm anticipated that asia would soon overtake north america as the largest video game market due to the strong growth of free-to-play and mobile games.sales of different types of games vary widely between countries due to local preferences. japanese consumers tend to purchase much more handheld games than console games and especially pc games, with a strong preference for games catering to local tastes. another key difference is that, despite the decline of arcades in the west, arcade games remain an important sector of the japanese gaming industry. in south korea, computer games are generally preferred over console games, especially mmorpg games and real-time strategy games. computer games are also popular in china.creators will nearly always copyright their games. laws that define copyright, and the rights that are conveyed over a video game vary from country to country. usually a fair use copyright clause allows consumers some ancillary rights, such as for a player of the game to stream a game online. this is a vague area in copyright law, as these laws predate the advent of video games. this means that rightsholders often must define what they will allow a consumer to do with the video game.although departments of computer science have been studying the technical aspects of video games for years, theories that examine games as an artistic medium are a relatively recent development in the humanities. the two most visible schools in this emerging field are ludology and narratology. narrativists approach video games in the context of what janet murray calls ""cyberdrama"". that is to say, their major concern is with video games as a storytelling medium, one that arises out of interactive fiction. murray puts video games in the context of the holodeck, a fictional piece of technology from star trek, arguing for the video game as a medium in which the player is allowed to become another person, and to act out in another world. this image of video games received early widespread popular support, and forms the basis of films such as tron, existenz and the last starfighter.ludologists break sharply and radically from this idea. they argue that a video game is first and foremost a game, which must be understood in terms of its rules, interface, and the concept of play that it deploys. espen j. aarseth argues that, although games certainly have plots, characters, and aspects of traditional narratives, these aspects are incidental to gameplay. for example, aarseth is critical of the widespread attention that narrativists have given to the heroine of the game tomb raider, saying that ""the dimensions of lara crofts body, already analyzed to death by film theorists, are irrelevant to me as a player, because a different-looking body would not make me play differently... when i play, i dont even see her body, but see through it and past it."" simply put, ludologists reject traditional theories of art because they claim that the artistic and socially relevant qualities of a video game are primarily determined by the underlying set of rules, demands, and expectations imposed on the player.while many games rely on emergent principles, video games commonly present simulated story worlds where emergent behavior occurs within the context of the game. the term ""emergent narrative"" has been used to describe how, in a simulated environment, storyline can be created simply by ""what happens to the player."" however, emergent behavior is not limited to sophisticated games. in general, any place where event-driven instructions occur for ai in a game, emergent behavior will exist. for instance, take a racing game in which cars are programmed to avoid crashing, and they encounter an obstacle in the track: the cars might then maneuver to avoid the obstacle causing the cars behind them to slow and/or maneuver to accommodate the cars in front of them and the obstacle. the programmer never wrote code to specifically create a traffic jam, yet one now exists in the game.video game culture is a worldwide new media subculture formed around video games and game playing. as computer and video games have increased in popularity over time, they have had a significant influence on popular culture. video game culture has also evolved over time hand in hand with internet culture as well as the increasing popularity of mobile games. many people who play video games identify as gamers, which can mean anything from someone who enjoys games to someone who is passionate about it. as video games become more social with multiplayer and online capability, gamers find themselves in growing social networks. gaming can both be entertainment as well as competition, as a new trend known as electronic sports is becoming more widely accepted. in the 2010s, video games and discussions of video game trends and topics can be seen in social media, politics, television, film and music. since the mid-2000s there has been debate whether video games qualify as art, primarily as the forms interactivity interfered with the artistic intent of the work and that they are designed for commercial appeal. a significant debate on the matter came after film critic roger ebert published an essay ""video games can never be art"", which challenged the industry to prove him and other critics wrong. the view that video games were an art form was cemented in 2011 when the u.s. supreme court ruled in the landmark case brown v. entertainment merchants association that video games were a protected form of speech with artistic merit. since then, video game developers have come to use the form more for artistic expression, including the development of art games, and the cultural heritage of video games as works of arts, beyond their technical capabilities, have been part of major museum exhibits, including the art of video games at the smithsonian american art museum and toured at other museums from 2012016.besides their entertainment value, appropriately-designed video games have been seen to provide value in education across several ages and comprehension levels. learning principles found in video games have been identified as possible techniques with which to reform the u.s. education system. it has been noticed that gamers adopt an attitude while playing that is of such high concentration, they do not realize they are learning, and that if the same attitude could be adopted at school, education would enjoy significant benefits. students are found to be ""learning by doing"" while playing video games while fostering creative thinking.video games are also believed to be beneficial to the mind and body. it has been shown that action video game players have better hand003 to 2007, the outrage over the ""no russian"" level from call of duty: modern warfare 2 in 2009, and the gamergate movement in 2014.players of video games often maintain collections of games. more recently there has been interest in retrogaming, focusing on games from the first decades. games in retail packaging in good shape have become collectors items for the early days of the industry, with some rare publications having gone for over us$100,000 as of 2020. separately, there is also concern about the preservation of video games, as both game media and the hardware to play them degrade over time. further, many of the game developers and publishers from the first decades no longer exist, so records of their games have disappeared. archivists and preservations have worked within the scope of copyright law to save these games as part of the cultural history of the industry.there are many video game museums around the world, including the national videogame museum in frisco, texas, which serves as the largest museum wholly dedicated to the display and preservation of the industrys most important artifacts. europe hosts video game museums such as the computer games museum in berlin and the museum of soviet arcade machines in moscow and saint-petersburg. the museum of art and digital entertainment in oakland, california is a dedicated video game museum focusing on playable exhibits of console and computer games. the video game museum of rome is also dedicated to preserving video games and their history. the international center for the history of electronic games at the strong in rochester, new york contains one of the largest collections of electronic games and game-related historical materials in the world, including a 5,000-square-foot  the smithsonian institution in washington, dc has three video games on permanent display: pac-man, dragons lair, and pong.the museum of modern art has added a total of 20 video games and one video game console to its permanent architecture and design collection since 2012. in 2012, the smithsonian american art museum ran an exhibition on ""the art of video games"". however, the reviews of the exhibit were mixed, including questioning whether video games belong in an art museum.",1,0
"fishing is the activity of trying to catch fish. fish are normally caught in the wild. techniques for catching fish include hand gathering, spearing, netting, angling and trapping. 005, the worldwide per capita consumption of fish captured from wild fisheries was 14.4 kilograms, with an additional 7.4 kilograms harvested from fish farms.fishing is an ancient practice that dates back to at least the beginning of the upper paleolithic period about 40,000 years ago. isotopic analysis of the remains of tianyuan man, a 40,000-year-old modern human from eastern asia, has shown that he regularly consumed freshwater fish. archaeology features such as shell middens, discarded fish bones, and cave paintings show that sea foods were important for survival and consumed in significant quantities. fishing in africa is evident very early on in human history. neanderthals were fishing by about 200,000 bc. people could have developed basketry for fish traps, and spinning and early forms of knitting in order to make fishing nets to be able to catch more fish in larger quantities.during this period, most people lived a hunter-gatherer lifestyle and were, of necessity, constantly on the move. however, where there are early examples of permanent settlements this revolutionary design made large scale trawling in the ocean possible for the first time, resulting in a massive migration of fishers from the ports in the south of england, to villages further north, such as scarborough, hull, grimsby, harwich and yarmouth, that were points of access to the large fishing grounds in the atlantic ocean.the small village of grimsby grew to become the largest fishing port in the world by the mid 19th century. an act of parliament was first obtained in 1796, which authorised the construction of new quays and dredging of the haven to make it deeper. it was only in 1846, with the tremendous expansion in the fishing industry, that the grimsby dock company was formed. the foundation stone for the royal dock was laid by albert the prince consort in 1849. the dock covered 25 acres  by the end of the 19th century, there were over 3,000 fishing trawlers in commission in britain, with almost 1,000 at grimsby. these trawlers were sold to fishers around europe, including from the netherlands and scandinavia. twelve trawlers went on to form the nucleus of the german fishing fleet.the earliest steam-powered fishing boats first appeared in the 1870s and used the trawl system of fishing as well as lines and drift nets. these were large boats, usually 800,000 men on the north sea. the steam drifter was not used in the herring fishery until 1897. the last sailing fishing trawler was built in 1925 in grimsby. trawler designs adapted as the way they were powered changed from sail to coal-fired steam by world war i to diesel and turbines by the end of world war ii.in 1931, the first powered drum was created by laurie jarelainen. the drum was a circular device that was set to the side of the boat and would draw in the nets. since world war ii, radio navigation aids and fish finders have been widely used. the first trawlers fished over the side, rather than over the stern. the first purpose-built stern trawler was fairtry built-in 1953 at aberdeen, scotland. the ship was much larger than any other trawlers then in operation and inaugurated the era of the super trawler. as the ship pulled its nets over the stern, it could lift out a much greater haul of up to 60 tons. the ship served as a basis for the expansion of super trawlers around the world in the following decades.the early evolution of fishing as recreation is not clear. for example, there is anecdotal evidence for fly fishing in japan, however, fly fishing was likely to have been a means of survival, rather than recreation. the earliest english essay on recreational fishing was published in 1496, by dame juliana berners, the prioress of the benedictine sopwell nunnery. the essay was titled treatyse of fysshynge wyth an angle, and included detailed information on fishing waters, the construction of rods and lines, and the use of natural baits and artificial flies.recreational fishing took a great leap forward after the english civil war, where a newly found interest in the activity left its mark on the many books and treatises that were written on the subject at the time. leonard mascall in 1589 wrote a booke of fishing with hooke and line along with many others he produced in his life on game and wildlife in england at the time. the compleat angler was written by izaak walton in 1653 charles kirby designed an improved fishing hook in 1655 that remains relatively unchanged to this day. he went on to invent the kirby bend, a distinctive hook with an offset point, still commonly used today.the 18th century was mainly an era of consolidation of the techniques developed in the previous century. running rings began to appear along the fishing rods, which gave anglers greater control over the cast line. the rods themselves were also becoming increasingly sophisticated and specialised for different roles. jointed rods became common from the middle of the century and bamboo came to be used for the top section of the rod, giving it a much greater strength and flexibility.the industry also became commercialised 004 there were four million commercial fishing vessels. about 1.3 million of these are decked vessels with enclosed areas. nearly all of these decked vessels are mechanised, and 40,000 of them are over 100 tons. at the other extreme, two-thirds  these boats are used by artisan fishers.it is difficult to estimate how many recreational fishing boats there are, although the number is high. the term is fluid since some recreational boats may also be used for fishing from time to time. unlike most commercial fishing vessels, recreational fishing boats are often not dedicated just to fishing. just about anything that will stay afloat can be called a recreational fishing boat, so long as a fisher periodically climbs aboard with the intent to catch a fish. fish are caught for recreational purposes from boats which range from dugout canoes, float tubes, kayaks, rafts, stand up paddleboards, pontoon boats and small dinghies to runabouts, cabin cruisers and cruising yachts to large, hi-tech and luxurious big game rigs. larger boats, purpose-built with recreational fishing in mind, usually have large, open cockpits at the stern, designed for convenient fishing.traditional fishing is any kind of small scale, commercial or subsistence fishing practices using traditional techniques such as rod and tackle, arrows and harpoons, throw nets and drag nets, etc.recreational and sport fishing are fishing primarily for pleasure or competition. recreational fishing has conventions, rules, licensing restrictions and laws that limit how fish may be caught; typically, these prohibit the use of nets and the catching of fish with hooks not in the mouth. the most common form of recreational fishing is done with a rod, reel, line, hooks and any one of a wide range of baits or lures such as artificial flies. the practice of catching or attempting to catch fish with a hook is generally known as angling. in angling, it is sometimes expected or required that fish be returned to the water  the commercial activity is aimed at the delivery of fish and other seafood products for human consumption or use as raw material in other industrial processes.there are three principal industry sectors:commercial fishing is the capture of fish for commercial purposes. those who practice it must often pursue fish far from the land under adverse conditions. commercial fishermen harvest almost all aquatic species, from tuna, cod and salmon to shrimp, krill, lobster, clams, squid and crab, in various fisheries for these species. commercial fishing methods have become very efficient using large nets and sea-going processing factories. individual fishing quotas and international treaties seek to control the species and quantities caught.a commercial fishing enterprise may vary from one man with a small boat with hand-casting nets or a few pot traps, to a huge fleet of trawlers processing tons of fish every day.commercial fishing gear includes weights, nets fish and other aquatic organisms are also processed into various food and non-food products, such as sharkskin leather, pigments made from the inky secretions of cuttlefish, isinglass used for the clarification of wine and beer, fish emulsion used as a fertiliser, fish glue, fish oil and fish meal.fish are also collected live for research and the aquarium trade.fisheries management draws on fisheries science to find ways to protect fishery resources so sustainable exploitation is possible. modern fisheries management is often referred to as a governmental system of  this is controversial and has been disputed. the expansion of fish farming as well as animal welfare concerns in society has led to research into more humane and faster ways of killing fish.in large-scale operations like fish farms, stunning fish with electricity or putting them into water saturated with nitrogen so that they cannot breathe, results in death more rapidly than just taking them out of the water. for sport fishing, it is recommended that fish be killed soon after catching them by hitting them on the head followed by bleeding out or by stabbing the brain with a sharp object ",1,0
"atlanta  it is also the 37th most populous city in the united states. the city serves as the cultural and economic center of the atlanta metropolitan area, home to more than 61st century with the growth of the atlanta beltline, altering the citys demographics, politics, aesthetics, and culture.for thousands of years prior to the arrival of european settlers in north georgia, the indigenous creek people and their ancestors inhabited the area. standing peachtree, a creek village where peachtree creek flows into the chattahoochee river, was the closest native american settlement to what is now atlanta. through the early nineteenth century, european americans systematically encroached on the creek of northern georgia, forcing them out of the area from 1802 to 1825. the creek were forced to leave the area in 1821, under indian removal by the federal government, and european american settlers arrived the following year.in 1836, the georgia general assembly voted to build the western and atlantic railroad in order to provide a link between the port of savannah and the midwest. the initial route was to run southward from chattanooga to a terminus east of the chattahoochee river, which would be linked to savannah. after engineers surveyed various possible locations for the terminus, the ""zero milepost"" was driven into the ground in what is now five points. a year later, the area around the milepost had developed into a settlement, first known as terminus, and later thrasherville, after a local merchant who built homes and a general store in the area. by 1842, the town had six buildings and 30 residents and was renamed marthasville to honor governor wilson lumpkins daughter martha. later, j. edgar thomson, chief engineer of the georgia railroad, suggested the town be renamed atlanta. the residents approved, and the town was incorporated as atlanta on december 29, 1847.by 1860, atlantas population had grown to 9,554. during the american civil war, the nexus of multiple railroads in atlanta made the city a strategic hub for the distribution of military supplies.in 1864, the union army moved southward following the capture of chattanooga and began its invasion of north georgia. the region surrounding atlanta was the location of several major army battles, culminating with the battle of atlanta and a four-month-long siege of the city by the union army under the command of general william tecumseh sherman. on september 1, 1864, confederate general john bell hood decided to retreat from atlanta, and he ordered the destruction of all public buildings and possible assets that could be of use to the union army. on the next day, mayor james calhoun surrendered atlanta to the union army, and on september 7, sherman ordered the citys civilian population to evacuate. on november 11, 1864, sherman prepared for the union armys march to the sea by ordering the destruction of atlantas remaining military assets.after the civil war ended in 1865, atlanta was gradually rebuilt. the work attracted many new residents. due to the citys superior rail transportation network, the state capital was moved from milledgeville to atlanta in 1868. in the 1880 census, atlanta had surpassed savannah as georgias largest city.beginning in the 1880s, henry w. grady, the editor of the atlanta constitution newspaper, promoted atlanta to potential investors as a city of the ""new south"" that would be based upon a modern economy and less reliant on agriculture. by 1885, the founding of the georgia school of technology during the first decades of the 20th century, atlanta enjoyed a period of unprecedented growth. in three decades time, atlantas population tripled as the city limits expanded to include nearby streetcar suburbs. the citys skyline grew taller with the construction of the equitable, flatiron, empire, and candler buildings. sweet auburn emerged as a center of black commerce. the period was also marked by strife and tragedy. increased racial tensions led to the atlanta race riot of 1906, when whites attacked blacks, leaving at least 27 people dead and over 70 injured, with extensive damage in black neighborhoods. in 1913, leo frank, a jewish-american factory superintendent, was convicted of the murder of a 13-year-old girl in a highly publicized trial. he was sentenced to death but the governor commuted his sentence to life. an enraged and organized lynch mob took him from jail in 1915 and hanged him in marietta. the jewish community in atlanta and across the country were horrified. on may 21, 1917, the great atlanta fire destroyed 1,938 buildings in what is now the old fourth ward, resulting in one fatality and the displacement of 10,000 people.on december 15, 1939, atlanta hosted the premiere of gone with the wind, the epic film based on the best-selling novel by atlantas margaret mitchell. the gala event at loews grand theatre was attended by the films legendary producer, david o. selznick, and the films stars clark gable, vivien leigh, and olivia de havilland, but oscar winner hattie mcdaniel, an african-american actress, was barred from the event due to racial segregation laws.atlanta played a vital role in the allied effort during world war ii due to the citys war-related manufacturing companies, railroad network and military bases. the defense industries attracted thousands of new residents and generated revenues, resulting in rapid population and economic growth. in the 1950s, the citys newly constructed highway system, supported by federal subsidies, allowed middle class atlantans the ability to relocate to the suburbs. as a result, the city began to make up an ever-smaller proportion of the metropolitan areas population.african-american veterans returned from world war ii seeking full rights in their country and began heightened activism. in exchange for support by that portion of the black community that could vote, in 1948 the mayor ordered the hiring of the first eight african-american police officers in the city. in the 1960s, atlanta became a major organizing center of the civil rights movement, with martin luther king jr., ralph david abernathy, and students from atlantas historically black colleges and universities playing major roles in the movements leadership. while atlanta in the postwar years had relatively minimal racial strife compared to other cities, blacks were limited by discrimination, segregation, and continued disenfranchisement of most voters. in 1961, the city attempted to thwart blockbusting by realtors by erecting road barriers in cascade heights, countering the efforts of civic and business leaders to foster atlanta as the ""city too busy to hate"".desegregation of the public sphere came in stages, with public transportation desegregated by 1959, the restaurant at richs department store by 1961, movie theaters by 1963, and public schools by 1973 in 1960, whites comprised 61.7% of the citys population. during the 1950s0% of its population. at the same time, it developed new office space after attracting numerous corporations, with an increasing portion of workers from northern areas.atlanta was selected as the site for the 1996 summer olympic games. following the announcement, the city government undertook several major construction projects to improve atlantas parks, sporting venues, and transportation infrastructure; however, for the first time, none of the $1.771 events. the related projects such as atlantas olympic legacy program and civic effort initiated a fundamental transformation of the city in the following decade.during the 2000s, atlanta underwent a profound physical, cultural, and demographic transformation. as some of the black middle and upper classes also began to move to the suburbs, a booming economy drew numerous new migrants from other areas of the country, who contributed to changes in the citys demographics. african americans made up a decreasing portion of the population, from a high of 67% in 1990 to 54% in 2010. from 2000 to 2010, atlanta gained 22,763 white residents, 5,142 asian residents, and 3,095 hispanic residents, while the citys black population decreased by 31,678. much of the citys demographic change during the decade was driven by young, college-educated professionals: from 2000 to 2009, the three-mile radius surrounding downtown atlanta gained 9,722 residents aged 25 to 34 and holding at least a four-year degree, an increase of 61%. this was similar to the tendency in other cities for young, college educated, single or married couples to live in downtown areas.between the mid-1990s and 2010, stimulated by funding from the hope vi program and under leadership of ceo renee lewis glover  the atlanta housing authority demolished nearly all of its public housing, a total of 17,000 units and about 10% of all housing units in the city. after reserving 2,000 units mostly for elderly, the aha allowed redevelopment of the sites for mixed-use and mixed-income, higher density developments, with 40% of the units to be reserved for affordable housing. two-fifths of previous public housing residents attained new housing in such units; the remainder received vouchers to be used at other units, including in suburbs. at the same time, in an effort to change the culture of those receiving subsidized housing, the aha imposed a requirement for such residents to work in 2005, the city approved the $2.82-mile freight railroad loop that surrounds the central city into an art-filled multi-use trail and light rail transit line, which would increase the citys park space by 40%. the project stimulated retail and residential development along the loop, but has been criticised for its adverse effects on some black communities.atlantas cultural offerings expanded during the 2000s: the high museum of art doubled in size; the alliance theatre won a tony award; and art galleries were established on the once-industrial westside. the city of atlanta was the subject of a massive cyberattack which began in march 2018.atlanta encompasses 134.0 square miles  the city is situated among the foothills of the appalachian mountains. at 1,050 feet  atlanta straddles the eastern continental divide. rainwater that falls on the south and east side of the divide flows into the atlantic ocean, while rainwater on the north and west side of the divide flows into the gulf of mexico. atlanta developed on a ridge south of the chattahoochee river, which is part of the acf river basin. the river borders the far northwestern edge of the city, and much of its natural habitat has been preserved, in part by the chattahoochee river national recreation area.most of atlanta was burned during the civil war, depleting the city of a large stock of its historic architecture. yet architecturally, the city had never been traditionally ""southern"" because atlanta originated as a railroad town, rather than a southern seaport dominated by the planter class, such as savannah or charleston. because of its later development, many of the citys landmarks share architectural characteristics with buildings in the northeast or midwest, as they were designed at a time of shared national architectural styles.during the late twentieth century, atlanta embraced the global trend of modern architecture, especially for commercial and institutional structures. examples include the state of georgia building built in 1966, and the georgia-pacific tower in 1982. many of the most notable examples from this period we designed by world renowned atlanta architect john portman. most of the buildings that define the downtown skyline were designed by portman during this period, including the westin peachtree plaza and the atlanta marriott marquis. in the latter half of the 1980s, atlanta became one of the early homes of postmodern buildings that reintroduced classical elements to their designs. many of atlantas tallest skyscrapers were built in this period and style, displaying tapering spires or otherwise ornamented crowns, such as one atlantic center the citys embrace of modern architecture has often translated into an ambivalent approach toward historic preservation, leading to the destruction of many notable architectural landmarks. these include the equitable building  in the mid-1970s, the fox theatre, now a cultural icon of the city, would have met the same fate if not for a grassroots effort to save it. more recently, preservationists may have made some inroads. for example, in 2016 activists convinced the atlanta city council not to demolish the atlanta-fulton central library, the last building designed by noted architect marcel breuer.atlanta is divided into 242 officially defined neighborhoods. the city contains three major high-rise districts, which form a north0th century. when neighborhood opposition successfully prevented two freeways from being built through the citys east side in 1975, the area became the starting point for atlantas gentrification. after atlanta was awarded the olympic games in 1990, gentrification expanded into other parts of the city, stimulated by infrastructure improvements undertaken in preparation for the games. new development post-2000 has been aided by the atlanta housing authoritys eradication of the citys public housing. as noted above, it allowed development of these sites for mixed-income housing, requiring developers to reserve a considerable portion for affordable housing units. it has also provided for other former residents to be given vouchers to gain housing in other areas. construction of the beltline has stimulated new and related development along its path.under the k93, 1940, with around 10 inches  however, ice storms usually cause more problems than snowfall does, the most severe occurring on january 7, 1973. tornadoes are rare in the city itself, but the march 14, 2008 ef2 tornado damaged

southern cities like atlanta, birmingham, houston, and memphis. in the 2010 census, atlanta was recorded as the nations fourth-largest majority-black city. the new great migration brought an insurgence of african americans from california and the north to the atlanta area. it has long been known as a center of african-american political power, education, economic prosperity, and culture, often called a black mecca. some middle and upper class african-american residents of atlanta followed an influx of whites to newer housing and public schools in the suburbs in the early 21st century. from 2000 to 2010, the citys black population decreased by 31,678 people, shrinking from 61.4% of the citys population in 2000 to 54.0% in 2010, as the overall population expanded and migrants

arabian gulf, ukraine and poland. within a few decades, and in keeping with national trends, immigrants from england, ireland, and german-speaking central europe were no longer the majority of atlantas foreign-born population. the citys italians included immigrants from northern italy, many of whom had been in atlanta since the 1890s; more recent arrivals from southern italy; and sephardic jews from the isle of rhodes, which italy had seized from turkey in 1912.of the total population five years and older, 83.3% spoke only english at home, while 8.8% spoke spanish, 3.9% another

formed a border between the coastal southern and southern appalachian dialects. because of the development of corporate headquarters in the region, attracting migrants from other areas of the country, by 2003, atlanta magazine concluded that atlanta had become significantly ""de-southernized"". a southern accent was considered a handicap in some circumstances. in general, southern accents are less prevalent among residents of the city and inner suburbs and among younger people; they are more common in the outer suburbs and among older people. at the same time, some residents of the city speak in southern variations of african-american english.religion in atlanta, while historically centered on protestant christianity, now encompasses many faiths, as a result of the city and metro areas

economy earning a ranking of 68 among 100 american cities in a september 2014 report due to an elevated unemployment rate, declining real income levels, and a depressed housing market. from 2010 to

significantly outpaced the national average by 2018, thanks to a rapidly-growing regional economy.atlanta is noted for its lack of southern culture. this is due to a large population of migrants from other parts of the u.s., in addition to many recent immigrants to the u.s. who have made the metropolitan area their home, establishing atlanta as the cultural and economic hub of an increasingly multi-cultural metropolitan area. thus, although traditional southern culture is part of atlantas cultural fabric, it is mostly a footnote to one of the nations most cosmopolitan cities. this unique

""gautama"" the evidence of the early texts suggests that siddharta gautama was born in lumbini and grew up in kapilavastu, a town in the ganges plain, near the modern nepal.22.327 offences including 75 rules of decorum for monks, along with penalties for transgression, in the theravadin tradition. the precise content of the vinaya pitaka  buddhist text with vinaya rules for monasteries have been traced in all buddhist traditions, with the oldest surviving being the ancient chinese translations.monastic communities in the buddhist tradition cut normal social ties to family and community, and live as ""islands unto themselves"". within a monastic fraternity, a sangha has its own rules. a monk abides by these institutionalised rules, and living life as the vinaya prescribes it is not merely a means, but very nearly the end in itself. transgressions by a monk on sangha vinaya rules invites enforcement, which can include temporary or permanent expulsion.another important practice taught by the buddha is the restraint of the senses  according to an3 of the brihadaranyaka upanishad with its ""become calm, subdued, quiet, patiently enduring, concentrated, one sees soul in oneself"" is most probably a meditative state. the buddhist discussion of meditation is without the concept of soul and the discussion criticises both the ascetic meditation of jainism and the ""real self, soul"" meditation of hinduism.buddhist texts teach various meditation schemas. one of the most prominent is that of the four rupa-jhth-century buddhist scholar sadhanamala.the veneration of and obedience to teachers is also important in theravada and zen buddhism.based on the indian principle of ahimsa  this led to various policies by buddhist kings such as asoka meant to protect animals, such as the establishing of no slaughter days and the banning of hunting on certain circumstances.however, early buddhist texts depict the buddha as allowing monastics to eat meat. this seems to be because monastics begged for their food and thus were supposed to accept whatever food was offered to them. this was tempered by the rule that meat had to be ""three times clean"" which meant that ""they had not seen, had not heard, and had no reason to suspect that the animal had been killed so that the meat could be given to them"". also, while the buddha did not explicitly promote vegetarianism in his discourses, he did state that gaining ones livelihood from the meat trade was unethical. however, this rule was not a promotion of a specific diet, but a rule against the actual killing of animals for food. there was also a famed schism which occurred in the buddhist community when devadatta attempted to make vegetarianism compulsory and the buddha disagreed.in contrast to this, various mahayana sutras and texts like the mahaparinirvana sutra, surangama sutra and the lankavatara sutra state that the buddha promoted vegetarianism out of compassion. indian mahayana thinkers like shantideva promoted the avoidance of meat. throughout history, the issue of whether buddhists should be vegetarian has remained a much debated topic and there is a variety of opinions on this issue among modern buddhists.in the east asian buddhism, most monastics are expected to be vegetarian, and the practice is seen as very virtuous and it is taken up by some devout laypersons. most theravadins in sri lanka and southeast asia do not practice vegetarianism and eat whatever is offered by the lay community, who are mostly also not vegetarians. but there are exceptions, some monks choose to be vegetarian and some abbots like ajahn sumedho have encouraged the lay community to donate vegetarian food to the monks. mahasi sayadaw meanwhile, has recommended vegetarianism as the best way to make sure ones meal is pure in three ways. also, the new religious movement santi asoke, promotes vegetarianism. according to peter harvey, in the theravada world, vegetarianism is ""universally admired, but little practiced."" because of the rule against killing, in many buddhist countries, most butchers and others who work in the meat trade are non-buddhists.likewise, most tibetan buddhists have historically tended not to be vegetarian, however, there have been some strong debates and pro-vegetarian arguments by some pro-vegetarian tibetans. some influential figures have spoken and written in favor of vegetarianism throughout history, including well known figures like shabkar and the 17th karmapa ogyen trinley dorje, who has mandated vegetarianism in all his monasteries.buddhism, like all indian religions, was initially an oral tradition in ancient times. the buddhas words, the early doctrines, concepts, and their traditional interpretations were orally transmitted from one generation to the next. the earliest oral texts were transmitted in middle indo-aryan languages called prakrits, such as pali, through the use of communal recitation and other mnemonic techniques.the first buddhist canonical texts were likely written down in sri lanka, about 400 years after the buddha died. the texts were part of the tripitakas, and many versions appeared thereafter claiming to be the words of the buddha. scholarly buddhist commentary texts, with named authors, appeared in india, around the 2nd century ce. these texts were written in pali or sanskrit, sometimes regional languages, as palm-leaf manuscripts, birch bark, painted scrolls, carved into temple walls, and later on paper.unlike what the bible is to christianity and the quran is to islam, but like all major ancient indian religions, there is no consensus among the different buddhist traditions as to what constitutes the scriptures or a common canon in buddhism. the general belief among buddhists is that the canonical corpus is vast. this corpus includes the ancient sutras organised into nikayas or agamas, itself the part of three basket of texts called the tripitakas. each buddhist tradition has its own collection of texts, much of which is translation of ancient pali and sanskrit buddhist texts of india. the chinese buddhist canon, for example, includes 2184 texts in 55 volumes, while the tibetan canon comprises 1108 textsnd-century bce greek king menander, after which menander abdicates and himself goes into monastic life in the pursuit of nirvana. some scholars have questioned the milindapanha version, expressing doubts whether menander was buddhist or just favourably disposed to buddhist monks.the kushan empire  kushan support helped buddhism to expand into a world religion through their trade routes. buddhism spread to khotan, the tarim basin, and china, eventually to other parts of the far east. some of the earliest written documents of the buddhist faith are the gandharan buddhist texts, dating from about the 1st century ce, and connected to the dharmaguptaka school.the islamic conquest of the iranian plateau in the 7th-century, followed by the muslim conquests of afghanistan and the later establishment of the ghaznavid kingdom with islam as the state religion in central asia between the 10th- and 12th-century led to the decline and disappearance of buddhism from most of these regions.the origins of mahnd century ce. much of the early extant evidence for the origins of mahnd or the 1st century ce, though the literary sources are all open to question. the first documented translation efforts by foreign buddhist monks in china were in the 2nd century ce, probably as a consequence of the expansion of the kushan empire into the chinese territory of the tarim basin.the first documented buddhist texts translated into chinese are those of the parthian an shigao  the first known mah0th century saw a prolific growth of new buddhist institutions in western countries, including the buddhist society, london  influential figures on post-war western buddhism include shunryu suzuki, jack kerouac, alan watts, th0th century. these new forms of buddhism are diverse and significantly depart from traditional beliefs and practices.in india, b.r. ambedkar launched the navayana tradition 017.buddhism has had a profound influence on various cultures, especially in asia. buddhist philosophy, buddhist art, buddhist architecture, buddhist cuisine and buddhist festivals continue to be influential elements of the modern culture of asia, especially in east asia and the sinosphere as well as in southeast asia and the indosphere. according to litian fang, buddhism has ""permeated a wide range of fields, such as politics, ethics, philosophy, literature, art and customs,"" in these asian regions.buddhist teachings influenced the development of modern hinduism as well as other asian religions like taoism and confucianism. for example, various scholars have argued that key hindu thinkers such as adi shankara and patanjali, author of the yoga sutras, were influenced by buddhist ideas. likewise, buddhist practices were influential in the early development of indian yoga.buddhist philosophers like dignaga were very influential in the development of indian logic and epistemology. buddhist educational institutions like nalanda and vikramashila preserved various disciplines of classical indian knowledge such as grammar and medicine and taught foreign students from china.in an effort to preserve their sacred scriptures, buddhist institutions such as temples and monasteries housed schools which educated the populace and promoted writing and literacy. this led to high levels of literacy among some traditional buddhist societies such as burma. according to david steinberg, ""early british observers claimed that burma was the most literate state between suez and japan, and one british traveler in the early nineteenth century believed that burmese women had a higher percentage of literacy than british women.""buddhist institutions were also at the forefront of the adoption of chinese technologies related to bookmaking, including paper, and block printing which buddhists sometimes deployed on a large scale. the first surviving example of a printed text is a buddhist charm, the first full printed book is the buddhist diamond sutra buddhists were also influential in the study and practice of traditional forms of indian medicine. buddhists spread these traditional approaches to health, sometimes called ""buddhist medicine"", throughout east and southeast asia, where they remain influential today in regions like sri lanka, burma, tibet and thailand.in the western world, buddhism has had a strong influence on modern new age spirituality and other alternative spiritualities. this began with its influence on 20th century theosophists such as helena blavatsky, which were some of the first westerners to take buddhism seriously as a spiritual tradition.more recently, buddhist meditation practices have influenced the development of modern psychology, particularly the practice of mindfulness-based stress reduction  the influence of buddhism on psychology can also be seen in certain forms of modern psychoanalysis.buddhism also influenced the modern avant-garde movements during the 1950s and 60s through people like d. t. suzuki and his influence on figures like jack kerouac and allen ginsberg.shamanism is a widespread practice in buddhist societies. buddhist monasteries have long existed alongside local shamanic traditions. lacking an institutional orthodoxy, buddhists adapted to the local cultures, blending their own traditions with pre-existing shamanic culture. there was very little conflict between the sects, mostly limited to the shamanic practice of animal sacrifice, which buddhists see as equivalent to killing ones parents. however, buddhism requires acceptance of buddha as the greatest being in the cosmos, and local shamanic traditions were bestowed an inferior status.research into himalayan religion has shown that buddhist and shamanic traditions overlap in many respects: the worship of localized deities, healing rituals and exorcisms. the shamanic gurung people have adopted some of the buddhist beliefs such and rebirth but maintain the shamanic rites of ""guiding the soul"" after death. geoffrey samuel describes shamanic buddhism: ""vajrayana buddhism as practiced in tibet may be described as shamanic, in that it is centered around communication with an alternative mode of reality via the alternative states of consciousness of tantric yoga"".buddhism is practised by an estimated 488 million, 495 million, or 535 million people as of the 2010s, representing 7% to 8% of the worlds total population.china is the country with the largest population of buddhists, approximately 244 million or 18% of its total population. they are mostly followers of chinese schools of mahayana, making this the largest body of buddhist traditions. mahayana, also practised in broader east asia, is followed by over half of world buddhists.according to a demographic analysis reported by peter harvey: mahayana has 360 million adherents; theravada has 150 million adherents; and vajrayana has 18 million adherents.according to johnson & grim  over 98% of all buddhists live in the asia-pacific and south asia region. north america had about 3.9 million buddhists, europe 1.3 million, while south america, africa and the middle east had an estimated combined total of about 1 million buddhists in 2010.buddhism is the dominant religion in bhutan, myanmar, cambodia, tibet, laos, mongolia, sri lanka and thailand. large buddhist populations live in china  japan  taiwan  macau  north korea  nepal  vietnam  singapore  hong kong  and south korea in russia, buddhists form majority in tuva buddhism is also growing by conversion. in united states, only about a third  in new zealand, about 25\x80\x9335% of the total buddhists are converts to buddhism.the 10 countries with the largest buddhist population densities

"bodybuilding is the use of progressive resistance exercise to control and develop ones musculature  an individual who engages in this activity is referred to as a bodybuilder. in professional bodybuilding, competitors appear in lineups and perform specified poses some bodybuilders use anabolic steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs to build muscles and recover from injuries more quickly, but competitions sometimes ban using them because of the health risks or considerations regarding fair competition. despite some calls for testing for steroids, the leading bodybuilding federation  the winner of the annual ifbb mr. olympia contest is generally recognized as the worlds top male professional bodybuilder. since 1950, the nabba universe championships have been considered the top amateur bodybuilding contests, with notable winners such as reg park, lee priest, steve reeves, and arnold schwarzenegger. winners generally go on to become professional athletes.stone-lifting traditions were practiced in ancient egypt, greece, and tamilakam. western weightlifting developed in europe from 1880 to 1953, with strongmen displaying feats of strength for the public and challenging each other. the focus was not on their physique, and they often had large bellies and fatty limbs.bodybuilding developed in the late 19th century, promoted in england by german eugen sandow, now considered as the ""father of modern bodybuilding"". he allowed audiences to enjoy viewing his physique in ""muscle display performances"". although audiences were thrilled to see a well-developed physique, the men simply displayed their bodies as part of strength demonstrations or wrestling matches. sandow had a stage show built around these displays through his manager, florenz ziegfeld. the oscar-winning 1936 musical film the great ziegfeld depicts the beginning of modern bodybuilding, when sandow began to display his body for carnivals.sandow was so successful at flexing and posing his physique that he later created several businesses around his fame, and was among the first to market products branded with his name. he was credited with inventing and selling the first exercise equipment for the masses: machined dumbbells, spring pulleys, and tension bands. even his image was sold by the thousands in ""cabinet cards"" and other prints. sandow was a perfect ""gracilian"", a standard of ideal body proportions close to those of ancient greek and roman statues. mens physiques were then judged by how closely they matched these proportions.sandow organized the first bodybuilding contest on september 14, 1901, called the ""great competition"". it was held at the royal albert hall in london. judged by sandow, sir charles lawes, and sir arthur conan doyle, the contest was a great success and many bodybuilding enthusiasts were turned away due to the overwhelming amount of audience members. the trophy presented to the winner was a gold statue of sandow sculpted by frederick pomeroy. the winner was william l. murray of nottingham. the silver sandow trophy was presented to second-place winner d. cooper. the bronze sandow trophy 8, 1903 to january 2, 1904, the first large-scale bodybuilding competition in america took place at madison square garden in new york city. the competition was promoted by bernarr macfadden, the father of physical culture and publisher of original bodybuilding magazines such as health & strength. the winner was al treloar, who was declared ""the most perfectly developed man in the world"". treloar won a $1,000 cash prize, a substantial sum at that time. two weeks later, thomas edison made a film of treloars posing routine. edison had also made two films of sandow a few years before. those were the first three motion pictures featuring a bodybuilder. in the early 20th century, macfadden and charles atlas continued to promote bodybuilding across the world.many other important bodybuilders in the early history of bodybuilding prior to 1930 include: earle liederman  gustav fri003, joe weider sold weider publications to ami, which owns the national enquirer. the position of president of the ifbb was filled by rafael santonja following the death of ben weider in october 2008. in 2004, contest promoter wayne demilia broke ranks with the ifbb and ami took over the promotion of the mr. olympia contest: in 2017 ami took the contest outright.in the early 21st century, patterns of consumption and recreation similar to those of the united states became more widespread in europe and especially in eastern europe following the collapse of the soviet union. this resulted in the emergence of whole new populations of bodybuilders from former eastern bloc states.in the early 2000s, the ifbb was attempting to make bodybuilding an olympic sport. it obtained full ioc membership in 2000 and was attempting to get approved as a demonstration event at the olympics, which would hopefully lead to it being added as a full contest. this did not happen and olympic recognition for bodybuilding remains controversial since many argue that bodybuilding is not a sport.in the modern bodybuilding industry, the term ""professional"" generally means a bodybuilder who has won qualifying competitions as an amateur and has earned a ""pro card"" from their respective organization. professionals earn the right to compete in competitions that include monetary prizes. a pro card also prohibits the athlete from competing in federations other than the one from which they have received the pro card. depending on the level of success, these bodybuilders may receive monetary compensation from sponsors, much like athletes in other sports.due to the growing concerns of the high cost, health consequences, and illegal nature of some steroids, many organizations have formed in response and have deemed themselves ""natural"" bodybuilding competitions. in addition to the concerns noted, many promoters of bodybuilding have sought to shed the ""freakish"" perception that the general public has of bodybuilding and have successfully introduced a more mainstream audience to the sport of bodybuilding by including competitors whose physiques appear much more attainable and realistic.in natural contests, the testing protocol ranges among organizations from lie detectors to urinalysis. penalties also range from organization to organization from suspensions to strict bans from competition. it is also important to note that natural organizations also have their own list of banned substances and it is important to refer to each organizations website for more information about which substances are banned from competition. there are many natural bodybuilding organizations; some of the larger ones include: musclemania, ultimate fitness events due to the number of people who found bodybuilding to be ""too big"" or ""ugly"" and unhealthy, a new category was started in 2013. the first mr. olympia was mark wingson, which was followed by jeremy buendia for consecutive years. like bodybuilding, the federations in which you can compete in are all the same, there is natural and regular as well but the main difference between the two is that mens physique pose in board shorts rather than a traditional posing suit. bodybuilders are much larger than the men physique competitors as well as have an extensive routine when posing while the physique category only gets judged by the front and back poses. many of the competitors are not too large and have a bit of a more attainable and aesthetic physique in comparison to bodybuilding. although this category started off slow, it grew tremendously in the past 5 years, now mens physique seems to be the most popular class to be in.this is the middle ground of both mens physique and bodybuilding. the competitors in this category are not nearly as big as bodybuilders but not as small as mens physique competitors. they pose and perform in mens boxer briefs to show off the legs, unlike mens physique which hide the legs in board shorts. classic physique has only been around for 4 years now as it started in 2016. danny hester was the first classic physique mr. olympia and now chris bumstead is the 2019 mr. olympia.the first u.s. womens national physique championship, promoted by henry mcghee and held in canton, ohio in 1978, is generally regarded as the first true female bodybuilding contest5, or more. it is believed that protein needs to be consumed frequently throughout the day, especially during/after a workout, and before sleep. there is also some debate concerning the best type of protein to take. chicken, turkey, beef, pork, fish, eggs and dairy foods are high in protein, as are some nuts, seeds, beans, and lentils. casein or whey are often used to supplement the diet with additional protein. whey is the type of protein contained in many popular brands of protein supplements and is preferred by many bodybuilders because of its high biological value  that effect is somewhat overcome by combining casein and whey.bodybuilders were previously thought to require protein with a higher bv than that of soy, which was additionally avoided due to its alleged estrogenic  soy, flax, and other plant-based foods that contain phytoestrogens are also beneficial because they can inhibit some pituitary functions while stimulating the livers p450 system some bodybuilders often split their food intake into 5 to 7 meals of equal nutritional content and eat at regular intervals  while food does have a metabolic cost to digest, absorb, and store, called the thermic effect of food, it depends on the quantity and type of food, not how the food is spread across the meals of the day. well-controlled studies using whole-body calorimetry and doubly labeled water have demonstrated that there is no metabolic advantage to eating more frequently.the important role of nutrition in building muscle and losing fat means bodybuilders may consume a wide variety of dietary supplements. various products are used in an attempt to augment muscle size, increase the rate of fat loss, improve joint health, increase natural testosterone production, enhance training performance and prevent potential nutrient deficiencies.some bodybuilders use drugs such as anabolic steroids and precursor substances such as prohormones to increase muscle hypertrophy. anabolic steroids cause hypertrophy of both types  other performance-enhancing substances used by competitive bodybuilders include human growth hormone muscle growth is more difficult to achieve in older adults than younger adults because of biological aging, which leads to many metabolic changes detrimental to muscle growth; for instance, by diminishing growth hormone and testosterone levels. some recent clinical studies have shown that low-dose hgh treatment for adults with hgh deficiency changes the body composition by increasing muscle mass, decreasing fat mass, increasing bone density and muscle strength, improves cardiovascular parameters, and affects the quality of life without significant side effects.in rodents, knockdown of metallothionein gene expression results in activation of the akt pathway and increases in myotube size, in type iib fiber hypertrophy, and ultimately in muscle strength.a recent trend in bodybuilding is to inject synthol into muscles to create larger bulges, or injecting pmma into muscles to shape them. use of pmma to shape muscles is prohibited in the united states. however, it is not illegal to use synthol.site enhancement oil, often called santol or synthol  this is known as ""fluffing"". synthol is 85% oil, 7.5% lidocaine, and 7.5% alcohol. it is not restricted, and many brands are available on the internet. the use of injected oil to enhance muscle appearance is common among bodybuilders, despite the fact that synthol can cause pulmonary embolisms, nerve damage, infections, sclerosing lipogranuloma, stroke, and the formation of oil-filled granulomas, cysts or ulcers in the muscle. rare cases might require surgical intervention to avoid further damage to the muscle and/or to prevent loss of life.sesame oil is often used in such mixtures, which can cause allergic reactions such as vasculitis.as the injected muscle is not actually well-developed, it might droop under gravity.although muscle stimulation occurs in the gym  additionally, many athletes find that a daytime nap further increases their bodys ability to recover from training and build muscles. some bodybuilders add a massage at the end of each workout to their routine as a method of recovering.overtraining occurs when a bodybuilder has trained to the point where their workload exceeds their recovery capacity. there are many reasons why overtraining occurs, including lack of adequate nutrition, lack of recovery time between workouts, insufficient sleep, and training at a high intensity for too long  to avoid overtraining, intense frequent training must be met with at least an equal amount of purposeful recovery. timely provision of carbohydrates, proteins, and various micronutrients such as vitamins, minerals, phytochemicals, even nutritional supplements are acutely critical. a mental disorder, informally called \xb7 highland games",1,0
"carcharhiniformesheterodontiformeshexanchiformeslamniformesorectolobiformespristiophoriformessqualiformessquatiniformes,000 metres  sharks have a covering of dermal denticles that protects their skin from damage and parasites in addition to improving their fluid dynamics. they have numerous sets of replaceable teeth.well-known species such as the tiger shark, blue shark, great white shark, mako shark, thresher shark, and hammerhead shark are apex predators0 million years ago, before land vertebrates existed and before a variety of plants had colonized the continents. only scales have been recovered from the first sharks and not all paleontologists agree that these are from true sharks, suspecting that these scales are actually those of thelodont agnathans. the oldest generally accepted shark scales are from about 420 million years ago, in the silurian period. the first sharks looked very different from modern sharks. at this time the most common shark tooth is the cladodont, a style of thin tooth with three tines like a trident, apparently to help catch fish. the majority of modern sharks can be traced back to around 100 million years ago. most fossils are of teeth, often in large numbers. partial skeletons and even complete fossilized remains have been discovered. estimates suggest that sharks grow tens of thousands of teeth over a lifetime, which explains the abundant fossils. the teeth consist of easily fossilized calcium phosphate, an apatite. when a shark dies, the decomposing skeleton breaks up, scattering the apatite prisms. preservation requires rapid burial in bottom sediments.among the most ancient and primitive sharks is cladoselache, from about 370 million years ago, which has been found within paleozoic strata in ohio, kentucky, and tennessee. at that point in earths history these rocks made up the soft bottom sediments of a large, shallow ocean, which stretched across much of north america. cladoselache was only about 1 metre  its teeth had several pointed cusps, which wore down from use. from the small number of teeth found together, it is most likely that cladoselache did not replace its teeth as regularly as modern sharks. its caudal fins had a similar shape to the great white sharks and the pelagic shortfin and longfin makos. the presence of whole fish arranged tail-first in their stomachs suggest that they were fast swimmers with great agility.most fossil sharks from about 300 to 150 million years ago can be assigned to one of two groups. the xenacanthida was almost exclusive to freshwater environments. by the time this group became extinct about 220 million years ago, they had spread worldwide. the other group, the hybodonts, appeared about 320 million years ago and lived mostly in the oceans, but also in freshwater. the results of a 2014 study of the gill structure of an unusually well preserved 325-million-year-old fossil suggested that sharks are not ""living fossils"", but rather have evolved more extensively than previously thought over the hundreds of millions of years they have been around.modern sharks began to appear about 100 million years ago. fossil mackerel shark teeth date to the early cretaceous. one of the most recently evolved families is the hammerhead shark  the oldest white shark teeth date from 60 to 66 million years ago, around the time of the extinction of the dinosaurs. in early white shark evolution there are at least two lineages: one lineage is of white sharks with coarsely serrated teeth and it probably gave rise to the modern great white shark, and another lineage is of white sharks with finely serrated teeth. these sharks attained gigantic proportions and include the extinct megatoothed shark, c. megalodon. like most extinct sharks, c. megalodon is also primarily known from its fossil teeth and vertebrae. this giant shark reached a total length  c. megalodon may have approached a maxima of 20.3 metres  paleontological evidence suggests that this shark was an active predator of large cetaceans.sharks belong to the superorder selachimorpha in the subclass elasmobranchii in the class chondrichthyes. the elasmobranchii also include rays and skates; the chondrichthyes also include chimaeras. it was thought that the sharks form a polyphyletic group: some sharks are more closely related to rays than they are to some other sharks, but current molecular studies support monophyly of both groups of sharks and batoids.the superorder selachimorpha is divided into galea there are more than 470 species of sharks split across twelve orders, including four orders of sharks that have gone extinct:shark teeth are embedded in the gums rather than directly affixed to the jaw, and are constantly replaced throughout life. multiple rows of replacement teeth grow in a groove on the inside of the jaw and steadily move forward in comparison to a conveyor belt; some sharks lose 30,000 or more teeth in their lifetime. the rate of tooth replacement varies from once every 8 to 10 days to several months. in most species, teeth are replaced one at a time as opposed to the simultaneous replacement of an entire row, which is observed in the cookiecutter shark.tooth shape depends on the sharks diet: those that feed on mollusks and crustaceans have dense and flattened teeth used for crushing, those that feed on fish have needle-like teeth for gripping, and those that feed on larger prey such as mammals have pointed lower teeth for gripping and triangular upper teeth with serrated edges for cutting. the teeth of plankton-feeders such as the basking shark are small and non-functional.shark skeletons are very different from those of bony fish and terrestrial vertebrates. sharks and other cartilaginous fish  because sharks do not have rib cages, they can easily be crushed under their own weight on land.the jaws of sharks, like those of rays and skates, are not attached to the cranium. the jaws surface  this gives these areas much of the same strength found in the bony tissue found in other animals.generally sharks have only one layer of tesserae, but the jaws of large specimens, such as the bull shark, tiger shark, and the great white shark, have two to three layers or more, depending on body size. the jaws of a large great white shark may have up to five layers. in the rostrum  most sharks have eight fins. sharks can only drift away from objects directly in front of them because their fins do not allow them to move in the tail-first direction.unlike bony fish, sharks have a complex dermal corset made of flexible collagenous fibers and arranged as a helical network surrounding their body. this works as an outer skeleton, providing attachment for their swimming muscles and thus saving energy. their dermal teeth give them hydrodynamic advantages as they reduce turbulence when swimming.tails provide thrust, making speed and acceleration dependent on tail shape. caudal fin shapes vary considerably between shark species, due to their evolution in separate environments. sharks possess a heterocercal caudal fin in which the dorsal portion is usually noticeably larger than the ventral portion. this is because the sharks vertebral column extends into that dorsal portion, providing a greater surface area for muscle attachment. this allows more efficient locomotion among these negatively buoyant cartilaginous fish. by contrast, most bony fish possess a homocercal caudal fin.tiger sharks have a large upper lobe, which allows for slow cruising and sudden bursts of speed. the tiger shark must be able to twist and turn in the water easily when hunting to support its varied diet, whereas the porbeagle shark, which hunts schooling fish such as mackerel and herring, has a large lower lobe to help it keep pace with its fast-swimming prey. other tail adaptations help sharks catch prey more directly, such as the thresher sharks usage of its powerful, elongated upper lobe to stun fish and squid.unlike bony fish, sharks do not have gas-filled swim bladders for buoyancy. instead, sharks rely on a large liver filled with oil that contains squalene, and their cartilage, which is about half the normal density of bone. their liver constitutes up to 30% of their total body mass. the livers effectiveness is limited, so sharks employ dynamic lift to maintain depth while swimming. sand tiger sharks store air in their stomachs, using it as a form of swim bladder.  bottom-dwelling sharks, like the nurse shark, have negative buoyancy, allowing them to rest on the ocean floor.some sharks, if inverted or stroked on the nose, enter a natural state of tonic immobility. researchers use this condition to handle sharks safely.like other fish, sharks extract oxygen from seawater as it passes over their gills. unlike other fish, shark gill slits are not covered, but lie in a row behind the head. a modified slit called a spiracle lies just behind the eye, which assists the shark with taking in water during respiration and plays a major role in bottom5 to 500 to 30 years. the spiny dogfish has one of the longest lifespans at more than 100 years. whale sharks  earlier estimates suggested the greenland shark unlike most bony fish, sharks are k-selected reproducers, meaning that they produce a small number of well-developed young as opposed to a large number of poorly developed young. fecundity in sharks ranges from 2 to over 100 young per reproductive cycle. sharks mature slowly relative to many other fish. for example, lemon sharks reach sexual maturity at around age 13016 a great white shark was captured on video for the first time in a state researchers believed was sleep swimming.most sharks are carnivorous. basking sharks, whale sharks, and megamouth sharks have independently evolved different strategies for filter feeding plankton: basking sharks practice ram feeding, whale sharks use suction to take in plankton and small fishes, and megamouth sharks make suction feeding more efficient by using the luminescent tissue inside of their mouths to attract prey in the deep ocean. this type of feeding requires gill rakers,000 metres in 2006 the international shark attack file contrary to popular belief, only a few sharks are dangerous to humans. out of more than 470 species, only four have been involved in a significant number of fatal, unprovoked attacks on humans: the great white, oceanic whitetip, tiger, and bull sharks. these sharks are large, powerful predators, and may sometimes attack and kill people. despite being responsible for attacks on humans they have all been filmed without using a protective cage.the perception of sharks as dangerous animals has been popularized by publicity given to a few isolated unprovoked attacks, such as the jersey shore shark attacks of 1916, and through popular fictional works about shark attacks, such as the jaws film series. jaws author peter benchley, as well as jaws director steven spielberg, later attempted to dispel the image of sharks as man-eating monsters.to help avoid an unprovoked attack, humans should not wear jewelry or metal that is shiny and refrain from splashing around too much.in general, sharks show little pattern of attacking humans specifically. research indicates that when humans do become the object of a shark attack, it is possible that the shark has mistaken the human for species that are its normal prey, such as seals.until recently, only a few benthic species of shark, such as hornsharks, leopard sharks and catsharks, had survived in aquarium conditions for a year or more. this gave rise to the belief that sharks, as well as being difficult to capture and transport, were difficult to care for. more knowledge has led to more species  the great white shark had never been successfully held in captivity for long periods of time until september 2004, when the monterey bay aquarium successfully kept a young female for 198 days before releasing her.most species are not suitable for home aquaria, and not every species sold by pet stores are appropriate. some species can flourish in home saltwater aquaria. uninformed or unscrupulous dealers sometimes sell juvenile sharks like the nurse shark, which upon reaching adulthood is far too large for typical home aquaria. public aquaria generally do not accept donated specimens that have outgrown their housing. some owners have been tempted to release them. species appropriate to home aquaria represent considerable spatial and financial investments as they generally approach adult lengths of 3 feet sharks figure prominently in hawaiian mythology. stories tell of men with shark jaws on their back who could change between shark and human form. a common theme was that a shark-man would warn beach-goers of sharks in the waters. the beach-goers would laugh and ignore the warnings and get eaten by the shark-man who warned them. hawaiian mythology also includes many shark gods. among a fishing people, the most popular of all aumakua, or deified ancestor guardians, are shark aumakua. kamaku describes in detail how to offer a corpse to become a shark. the body transforms gradually until the kahuna can point the awe-struck family to the markings on the sharks body that correspond to the clothing in which the beloveds body had been wrapped. such a shark aumakua becomes the family pet, receiving food, and driving fish into the family net and warding off danger. like all aumakua it had evil uses such as helping kill enemies. the ruling chiefs typically forbade such sorcery. many native hawaiian families claim such an aumakua, who is known by name to the whole community.kamohoalii is the best known and revered of the shark gods, he was the older and favored brother of pele, and helped and journeyed with her to hawaii. he was able to assume all human and fish forms. a summit cliff on the crater of kilauea is one of his most sacred spots. at one point he had a heiau  in fijian mythology, dakuwaqa was a shark god who was the eater of lost souls.on the island of tutuila in american samoa  according to the u.s. national park service, ""villagers from nearby vaitogi continue to reenact an important aspect of the legend at turtle and shark by performing a ritual song intended to summon the legendary animals to the ocean surface, and visitors are frequently amazed to see one or both of these creatures emerge from the sea in apparent response to this call.""in contrast to the complex portrayals by hawaiians and other pacific islanders, the european and western view of sharks has historically been mostly of fear and malevolence. sharks are used in popular culture commonly as eating machines, notably in the jaws novel and the film of the same name, along with its sequels. sharks are threats in other films such as deep blue sea, the reef, and others, although they are sometimes used for comedic effect such as in finding nemo and the austin powers series. sharks tend to be seen quite often in cartoons whenever a scene involves the ocean. such examples include the tom and jerry cartoons, jabberjaw, and other shows produced by hanna-barbera. they also are used commonly as a clich000, and 1.41 million tons for 2010. based on an analysis of average shark weights, this translates into a total annual mortality estimate of about 100 million sharks in 2000, and about 97 million sharks in 2010, with a total range of possible values between 63 and 273 million sharks per year. sharks are a common seafood in many places, including japan and australia. in the australian state of victoria, shark is the most commonly used fish in fish and chips, in which fillets are battered and deep-fried or crumbed and grilled. in fish and chip shops, shark is called flake. in india, small sharks or baby sharks  during a four-year period from 1996 to 2000, an estimated 26 to 73 million sharks were killed and traded annually in commercial markets.sharks are often killed for shark fin soup. fishermen capture live sharks, fin them, and dump the finless animal back into the water. shark finning involves removing the fin with a hot metal blade. the resulting immobile shark soon dies from suffocation or predators. shark fin has become a major trade within black markets all over the world. fins sell for about $300/lb in 2009. poachers illegally fin millions each year. few governments enforce laws that protect them. in 2010 hawaii became the first u.s. state to prohibit the possession, sale, trade or distribution of shark fins. from 1996 to 2000, an estimated 38 million sharks had been killed per year for harvesting shark fins. it is estimated by traffic that over 14,000 tonnes of shark fins were exported into singapore between 2005007 and 2012014.shark fin soup is a status symbol in asian countries and is erroneously considered healthy and full of nutrients. scientific research has revealed, however, that high concentrations of bmaa are present in shark fins. because bmaa is a neurotoxin, consumption of shark fin soup and cartilage pills, therefore, may pose a health risk. bmaa is under study for its pathological role in neurodegegerative diseases such as, als, alzheimers disease, and parkinsons disease.sharks are also killed for meat. european diners consume dogfishes, smoothhounds, catsharks, makos, porbeagle and also skates and rays. however, the u.s. fda lists sharks as one of four fish  capture-induced parturition is rarely considered in fisheries management despite being shown to occur in at least 12% of live bearing sharks and rays the majority of shark fisheries have little monitoring or management. the rise in demand for shark products increases pressure on fisheries. major declines in shark stocks have been recorded05 species were classified as critically endangered.in 2014, a shark cull in western australia killed dozens of sharks  until it was cancelled after public protests and a decision by the western australia epa; from 2014 to 2017, there was an ""imminent threat"" policy in western australia in which sharks that ""threatened"" humans in the ocean were shot and killed. this ""imminent threat"" policy was criticized by senator rachel siewart for killing endangered sharks. the ""imminent threat"" policy was cancelled in march 2017. in august 2018, the western australia government announced a plan to re-introduce drum lines from 1962 to the present, the government of queensland has targeted and killed sharks in large numbers by using drum lines, under a ""shark control"" program001 to 2018, a total of 10,480 sharks were killed on lethal drum lines in queensland, including in the great barrier reef. from 1962 to 2018, roughly 50,000 sharks were killed by queensland authorities.the government of new south wales has a program that deliberately kills sharks using nets. the current net program in new south wales has been described as being ""extremely destructive"" to marine life, including sharks. between 1950 and 2008, 352 tiger sharks and 577 great white sharks were killed in the nets in new south wales ,211 turtles, 8,448 rays, and 2,310 dolphins were killed in kwazulu-natal. authorities on the french island of r007 documentary sharkwater exposed how sharks are being hunted to extinction.in 1991, south africa was the first country in the world to declare great white sharks a legally protected species intending to ban the practice of shark finning while at sea, the united states congress passed the shark finning prohibition act in 2000.  two years later the act saw its first legal challenge in united states v. approximately 64,695 pounds of shark fins.  in 2008 a federal appeals court ruled that a loophole in the law allowed non-fishing vessels to purchase shark fins from fishing vessels while on the high seas.  seeking to close the loophole, the shark conservation act was passed by congress in december 2010, and it was signed into law in january 2011.in 2003, the european union introduced a general shark finning ban for all vessels of all nationalities in union waters and for all vessels flying a flag of one of its member states. this prohibition was amended in june 2013 to close remaining loopholes.in 2009, the international union for conservation of natures iucn red list of endangered species named 64 species, one-third of all oceanic shark species, as being at risk of extinction due to fishing and shark finning.in 2010, the convention on international trade in endangered species  in march 2013, three endangered commercially valuable sharks, the hammerheads, the oceanic whitetip and porbeagle were added to appendix 2 of cites, bringing shark fishing and commerce of these species under licensing and regulation.in 2010, greenpeace international added the school shark, shortfin mako shark, mackerel shark, tiger shark and spiny dogfish to its seafood red list, a list of common supermarket fish that are often sourced from unsustainable fisheries. advocacy group shark trust campaigns to limit shark fishing. advocacy group seafood watch directs american consumers to not eat sharks.under the auspices of the convention on the conservation of migratory species of wild animals in the united states, and as of january 16, 2019, 12 states including several regions now have shark sanctuaries or have banned shark fishing 020 researchers reported to have traced the origins of shark fins of endangered hammerhead sharks from a retail market in hong kong back to their source populations and therefore the approximate locations where the sharks were first caught using dna analysis.in july 2020 scientists reported results of a survey of 371 reefs in 58 nations estimating the conservation status of reef sharks globally. no sharks have been observed on almost 20% of the surveyed reefs and shark depletion was strongly associated with both socio-economic conditions and conservation measures. sharks are considered to be a vital part of the ocean ecosystem.",1,0

"intellectual disability  and formerly mental retardation  is a generalized neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by significantly impaired intellectual and adaptive functioning. it is defined by an iq under 70, in addition to deficits in two or more adaptive behaviors that affect everyday, general living.once focused almost entirely on cognition, the definition now includes both a component relating to mental functioning and one relating to an individuals functional skills in their daily environment. as a result of this focus on the persons abilities in practice, a person with an unusually low iq may still not be considered to have intellectual disability.intellectual disability is subdivided into syndromic intellectual disability, in which intellectual deficits associated with other medical and behavioral signs and symptoms are present, and non-syndromic intellectual disability, in which intellectual deficits appear without other abnormalities. down syndrome and fragile x syndrome are examples of syndromic intellectual disabilities.intellectual disability affects about 2013.intellectual disability  there often are no physical signs of mild forms of id, although there may be characteristic physical traits when it is associated with a genetic disorder the level of impairment ranges in severity for each person. some of the early signs can include:in early childhood, mild id  even when poor academic performance is recognized, it may take expert assessment to distinguish mild intellectual disability from specific learning disability or emotional/behavioral disorders. people with mild id are capable of learning reading and mathematics skills to approximately the level of a typical child aged nine to twelve. they can learn self-care and practical skills, such as cooking or using the local mass transit system. as individuals with intellectual disability reach adulthood, many learn to live independently and maintain gainful employment.moderate id people with severe  individuals with profound id are completely dependent on others for all adls and to maintain their physical health and safety. they may be able to learn to participate in some of these activities to limited degree.intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder  overlapping these two disorders, while common, can be detrimental to a persons well-being. those with asd that hold symptoms of id may be grouped into a co-diagnosis in which they are receiving treatment for a disorder they do not have. likewise, those with id that are mistaken to have asd may be treated for symptoms of a disorder they do not have. differentiating between these two disorders will allow clinicians to deliver or prescribe the appropriate treatments. comorbidity between id and asd is very common; roughly 40% of those with id also have asd and roughly 70% of those with asd also have id. both asd and id require shortfalls in communication and social awareness as defining criteria. both asd and id are classified by severity: mild, moderate, severe. in addition to those three levels, id has a fourth classification known as profound.in a study conducted in 2016 surveying 2816 cases, it was found that the top subsets that help differentiate between those with id and asd are, ""...impaired non-verbal social behavior and lack of social reciprocity,  restricted interests, strict adherence to routines, stereotyped and repetitive motor mannerisms, and preoccupation with parts of objects"". those with asd tend to show more deficits in non-verbal social behavior such as body language and understanding social cues. in a study done in 2008 of 336 individuals with varying levels of id, it was found that those with id display fewer instances of repetitive or ritualistic behaviors. it also recognized that those with asd, when compared to those with id, were more likely to isolate themselves and make less eye contact. when it comes to classification id and asd have very different guidelines. id has a standardized assessment called the supports intensity scale among children, the cause of intellectual disability is unknown for one-third to one-half of cases. about 5% of cases are inherited from a persons parents. genetic defects that cause intellectual disability, but are not inherited, can be caused by accidents or mutations in genetic development. examples of such accidents are development of an extra chromosome 18  velocardiofacial syndrome and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are the two next most common causes. however, there are many other causes. the most common are:according to both the american association on intellectual and developmental disabilities diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders it is formally diagnosed by an assessment of iq and adaptive behavior. a third condition requiring onset during the developmental period is used to distinguish intellectual disability from other conditions, such as traumatic brain injuries and dementias adaptive behavior, or adaptive functioning, refers to the skills needed to live independently by most definitions, intellectual disability is more accurately considered a disability rather than a disease. intellectual disability can be distinguished in many ways from mental illness, such as schizophrenia or depression. currently, there is no ""cure"" for an established disability, though with appropriate support and teaching, most individuals can learn to do many things. causes, such as congenital hypothyroidism, if detected early may be treated to prevent development of an intellectual disability.there are thousands of agencies around the world that provide assistance for people with developmental disabilities. they include state-run, for-profit, and non-profit, privately run agencies. within one agency there could be departments that include fully staffed residential homes, day rehabilitation programs that approximate schools, workshops wherein people with disabilities can obtain jobs, programs that assist people with developmental disabilities in obtaining jobs in the community, programs that provide support for people with developmental disabilities who have their own apartments, programs that assist them with raising their children, and many more. there are also many agencies and programs for parents of children with developmental disabilities.beyond that, there are specific programs that people with developmental disabilities can take part in wherein they learn basic life skills. these ""goals"" may take a much longer amount of time for them to accomplish, but the ultimate goal is independence. this may be anything from independence in tooth brushing to an independent residence. people with developmental disabilities learn throughout their lives and can obtain many new skills even late in life with the help of their families, caregivers, clinicians and the people who coordinate the efforts of all of these people.there are four broad areas of intervention that allow for active participation from caregivers, community members, clinicians, and of course, the individual  psychosocial treatments are intended primarily for children before and during the preschool years as this is the optimum time for intervention. this early intervention should include encouragement of exploration, mentoring in basic skills, celebration of developmental advances, guided rehearsal and extension of newly acquired skills, protection from harmful displays of disapproval, teasing, or punishment, and exposure to a rich and responsive language environment. a great example of a successful intervention is the carolina abecedarian project that was conducted with over 100 children from low socioeconomic status families beginning in infancy through pre-school years. results indicated that by age 2, the children provided the intervention had higher test scores than control group children, and they remained approximately 5 points higher 10 years after the end of the program. by young adulthood, children from the intervention group had better educational attainment, employment opportunities, and fewer behavioral problems than their control-group counterparts.core components of behavioral treatments include language and social skills acquisition. typically, one-to-one training is offered in which a therapist uses a shaping procedure in combination with positive reinforcements to help the child pronounce syllables until words are completed. sometimes involving pictures and visual aids, therapists aim at improving speech capacity so that short sentences about important daily tasks  in a similar fashion, older children benefit from this type of training as they learn to sharpen their social skills such as sharing, taking turns, following instruction, and smiling. at the same time, a movement known as social inclusion attempts to increase valuable interactions between children with an intellectual disability and their non-disabled peers. cognitive-behavioral treatments, a combination of the previous two treatment types, involves a strategical-metastrategical learning technique that teaches children math, language, and other basic skills pertaining to memory and learning. the first goal of the training is to teach the child to be a strategical thinker through making cognitive connections and plans. then, the therapist teaches the child to be metastrategical by teaching them to discriminate among different tasks and determine which plan or strategy suits each task. finally, family-oriented strategies delve into empowering the family with the skill set they need to support and encourage their child or children with an intellectual disability. in general, this includes teaching assertiveness skills or behavior management techniques as well as how to ask for help from neighbors, extended family, or day-care staff. as the child ages, parents are then taught how to approach topics such as housing/residential care, employment, and relationships. the ultimate goal for every intervention or technique is to give the child autonomy and a sense of independence using the acquired skills he/she has.  in a 2019 cochrane review on beginning reading interventions for children and adolescents with intellectual disability small to moderate improvements in phonological awareness, word reading, decoding, expressive and receptive language skills and reading fluency were noted when these elements were part of the teaching intervention.although there is no specific medication for intellectual disability, many people with developmental disabilities have further medical complications and may be prescribed several medications. for example, autistic children with developmental delay may be prescribed antipsychotics or mood stabilizers to help with their behavior. use of psychotropic medications such as benzodiazepines in people with intellectual disability requires monitoring and vigilance as side effects occur commonly and are often misdiagnosed as behavioral and psychiatric problems.intellectual disability affects about 2013. it is more common in males and in low to middle income countries.intellectual disability has been documented under a variety of names throughout history. throughout much of human history, society was unkind to those with any type of disability, and people with intellectual disability were commonly viewed as burdens on their families.greek and roman philosophers, who valued reasoning abilities, disparaged people with intellectual disability as barely human. the oldest physiological view of intellectual disability is in the writings of hippocrates in the late fifth century bce, who believed that it was caused by an imbalance in the four humors in the brain.caliph al-walid until the enlightenment in europe, care and asylum was provided by families and the church  guardianships were created to take over their financial affairs.in the 17th century, thomas willis provided the first description of intellectual disability as a disease. he believed that it was caused by structural problems in the brain. according to willis, the anatomical problems could be either an inborn condition or acquired later in life.in the 18th and 19th centuries, housing and care moved away from families and towards an asylum model. people were placed by, or removed from, their families  heavy tranquilization and assembly-line methods of support were the norm, and the medical model of disability prevailed. services were provided based on the relative ease to the provider, not based on the needs of the individual. a survey taken in 1891 in cape town, south africa shows the distribution between different facilities. out of 2046 persons surveyed, 1,281 were in private dwellings, 120 in jails, and 645 in asylums, with men representing nearly two-thirds of the number surveyed. in situations of scarcity of accommodation, preference was given to white men and black men in the late 19th century, in response to charles darwins on the origin of species, francis galton proposed selective breeding of humans to reduce intellectual disability. early in the 20th century, the eugenics movement became popular throughout the world. this led to forced sterilization and prohibition of marriage in most of the developed world and was later used by adolf hitler as a rationale for the mass murder of people with intellectual disability during the holocaust. eugenics was later abandoned as an evil violation of human rights, and the practice of forced sterilization and prohibition from marriage was discontinued by most of the developed world by the mid-20th century.in 1905, alfred binet produced the first standardized test for measuring intelligence in children.although ancient roman law had declared people with intellectual disability to be incapable of the deliberate intent to harm that was necessary for a person to commit a crime, during the 1920s, western society believed they were morally degenerate.ignoring the prevailing attitude, civitans adopted service to people with developmental disabilities as a major organizational emphasis in 1952. their earliest efforts included workshops for special education teachers and daycamps for children with disabilities, all at a time when such training and programs were almost nonexistent. the segregation of people with developmental disabilities was not widely questioned by academics or policy-makers until the 1969 publication of wolf wolfensbergers seminal work ""the origin and nature of our institutional models"", drawing on some of the ideas proposed by sg howe 100 years earlier. this book posited that society characterizes people with disabilities as deviant, sub-human and burdens of charity, resulting in the adoption of that ""deviant"" role. wolfensberger argued that this dehumanization, and the segregated institutions that result from it, ignored the potential productive contributions that all people can make to society. he pushed for a shift in policy and practice that recognized the human needs of those with intellectual disability and provided the same basic human rights as for the rest of the population.the publication of this book may be regarded as the first move towards the widespread adoption of the social model of disability in regard to these types of disabilities, and was the impetus for the development of government strategies for desegregation. successful lawsuits against governments and an increasing awareness of human rights and self-advocacy also contributed to this process, resulting in the passing in the u.s. of the civil rights of institutionalized persons act in 1980.from the 1960s to the present, most states have moved towards the elimination of segregated institutions. normalization and deinstitutionalization are dominant. along with the work of wolfensberger and others including gunnar and rosemary dybwad, a number of scandalous revelations around the horrific conditions within state institutions created public outrage that led to change to a more community-based method of providing services.by the mid-1970s, most governments had committed to de-institutionalization, and had started preparing for the wholesale movement of people into the general community, in line with the principles of normalization. in most countries, this was essentially complete by the late 1990s, although the debate over whether or not to close institutions persists in some states, including massachusetts.in the past, lead poisoning and infectious diseases were significant causes of intellectual disability. some causes of intellectual disability are decreasing, as medical advances, such as vaccination, increase. other causes are increasing as a proportion of cases, perhaps due to rising maternal age, which is associated with several syndromic forms of intellectual disability.along with the changes in terminology, and the downward drift in acceptability of the old terms, institutions of all kinds have had to repeatedly change their names. this affects the names of schools, hospitals, societies, government departments, and academic journals. for example, the midlands institute of mental subnormality became the british institute of mental handicap and is now the british institute of learning disability. this phenomenon is shared with mental health and motor disabilities, and seen to a lesser degree in sensory disabilities.the terms used for this condition are subject to a process called the euphemism treadmill. this means that whatever term is chosen for this condition, it eventually becomes perceived as an insult. the terms mental retardation and mentally retarded were invented in the middle of the 20th century to replace the previous set of terms, which included ""imbecile"" and ""moron"" and are now considered offensive. by the end of the 20th century, these terms themselves have come to be widely seen as disparaging, politically incorrect, and in need of replacement. the term intellectual disability is now preferred by most advocates and researchers in most english-speaking countries.the term ""mental retardation"" was used in the american psychiatric associations dsm-iv  the term ""intellectual disability  as of 2013, ""intellectual disability  because of its specificity and lack of confusion with other conditions, the term ""mental retardation"" is still sometimes used in professional medical settings around the world, such as formal scientific research and health insurance paperwork.the several traditional terms that long predate psychiatry are simple forms of abuse in common usage today; they are often encountered in such old documents as books, academic papers, and census forms. for example, the british census of 1901 has a column heading including the terms imbecile and feeble-minded.vaguer expressions like developmentally disabled, special, or challenged have been used instead of the term mentally retarded.  the term developmental delay was popular among caretakers and parents of individuals with intellectual disability because delay suggests that a person is slowly reaching his or her full potential, rather than having a lifelong condition.usage has changed over the years and differed from country to country.  for example, mental retardation in some contexts covers the whole field but previously applied to what is now the mild mr group. feeble-minded used to mean mild mr in the uk, and once applied in the us to the whole field. ""borderline intellectual functioning"" is not currently defined, but the term may be used to apply to people with iqs in the 70s. people with iqs of 70 to 85 used to be eligible for special consideration in the us public education system on grounds of intellectual disability.albert julius levine and louis marks proposed a set of categories in their 1928 book testing intelligence and achievement. some of the terminology in the table came from contemporary terms for classifying individuals with intellectual disabilities.the american association on mental retardation changed its name to the american association on intellectual and developmental disabilities  to reflect the term ""intellectual disability"". in 2010, the aaidd released its 11th edition of its terminology and classification manual, which also used the term intellectual disability.in the uk, mental handicap had become the common medical term, replacing mental subnormality in scotland and mental deficiency in england and wales, until stephen dorrell, secretary of state for health for the united kingdom from 1995 to 1997, changed the nhss designation to learning disability. the new term is not yet widely understood, and is often taken to refer to problems affecting schoolwork  in education, ""learning difficulties"" is applied to a wide range of conditions: ""specific learning difficulty"" may refer to dyslexia, dyscalculia or developmental coordination disorder, while ""moderate learning difficulties"", ""severe learning difficulties"" and ""profound learning difficulties"" refer to more significant impairments.in england and wales between 1983 and 2008, the mental health act 1983 defined ""mental impairment"" and ""severe mental impairment"" as ""a state of arrested or incomplete development of mind which includes significant/severe impairment of intelligence and social functioning and is associated with abnormally aggressive or seriously irresponsible conduct on the part of the person concerned."" as behavior was involved, these were not necessarily permanent conditions: they were defined for the purpose of authorizing detention in hospital or guardianship. the term mental impairment was removed from the act in november 2008, but the grounds for detention remained. however, english statute law uses mental impairment elsewhere in a less well-defined manner0th century, people with intellectual disabilities were routinely excluded from public education, or educated away from other typically developing children. compared to peers who were segregated in special schools, students who are mainstreamed or included in regular classrooms report similar levels of stigma and social self-conception, but more ambitious plans for employment. as adults, they may live independently, with family members, or in different types of institutions organized to support people with disabilities. about 8% currently live in an institution or a group home.in the united states, the average lifetime cost of a person with an intellectual disability amounts to $223,000 per person, in 2003 us dollars, for direct costs such as medical and educational expenses.  the indirect costs were estimated at $771,000, due to shorter lifespans and lower than average economic productivity.  the total direct and indirect costs, which amount to a little more than a million dollars, are slightly more than the economic costs associated with cerebral palsy, and double that associated with serious vision or hearing impairments. of the costs, about 14% is due to increased medical expenses   the largest amount, 76%, is indirect costs accounting for reduced productivity and shortened lifespans.  some expenses, such as ongoing costs to family caregivers or the extra costs associated with living in a group home, were excluded from this calculation.the law treats person with intellectual disabilities differently than those without intellectual disabilities. their human rights and freedoms, including the right to vote, the right to conduct business, enter into contract, enter into marriage, right to education, are often limited. the courts have upheld some of these limitations and found discrimination in others. the un convention on the rights of persons with disabilities, which sets minimum standards for rights of persons with disabilities, has been ratified by more than 180 countries. in several u.s. states, and several european union states, persons with intellectual disabilities are disenfranchised. the european court of human rights ruled in alajos kiss v. hungary that hungary violated the applicants rights by a blank disenfranchisement of persons with intellectual disabilities who did not hold legal capacity.people with intellectual disability are usually at a higher risk of living with complex health conditions such as epilepsy and neurological disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, and behavioral and psychiatric problems compared to people without disabilities. adults also have a higher prevalence of poor social determinants of health, behavioral risk factors, depression, diabetes, and poor or fair health status than adults without intellectual disability.in the united kingdom people with intellectual disability live on average 16 years less than the general population. some of the barriers that exist for people with id accessing quality healthcare include: communication challenges, service eligibility, lack of training for healthcare providers, diagnostic overshadowing, and absence of targeted health promotion services. key recommendations from the cdc for improving the health status for people with intellectual disabilities include: improve access to health care, improve data collection, strengthen the workforce, include people with id in public health programs, and prepare for emergencies with people with disabilities in mind.",1,0
"the renaissance  was a period in european history marking the transition from the middle ages to modernity and covering the 15th and 16th centuries. it occurred after the crisis of the late middle ages and was associated with great social change. in addition to the standard periodization, proponents of a long renaissance put its beginning in the 14th century and its end in the 17th century. the traditional view focuses more on the early modern aspects of the renaissance and argues that it was a break from the past, but many historians today focus more on its medieval aspects and argue that it was an extension of the middle ages.the intellectual basis of the renaissance was its version of humanism, derived from the concept of roman humanitas and the rediscovery of classical greek philosophy, such as that of protagoras, who said that ""man is the measure of all things."" this new thinking became manifest in art, architecture, politics, science and literature. early examples were the development of perspective in oil painting and the revived knowledge of how to make concrete. although the invention of metal movable type sped the dissemination of ideas from the later 15th century, the changes of the renaissance were not uniform across europe: the first traces appear in italy as early as the late 13th century, in particular with the writings of dante and the paintings of giotto.as a cultural movement, the renaissance encompassed innovative flowering of latin and vernacular literatures, beginning with the 14th-century resurgence of learning based on classical sources, which contemporaries credited to petrarch; the development of linear perspective and other techniques of rendering a more natural reality in painting; and gradual but widespread educational reform. in politics, the renaissance contributed to the development of the customs and conventions of diplomacy, and in science to an increased reliance on observation and inductive reasoning. although the renaissance saw revolutions in many intellectual pursuits, as well as social and political upheaval, it is perhaps best known for its artistic developments and the contributions of such polymaths as leonardo da vinci and michelangelo, who inspired the term ""renaissance man"".the renaissance began in the 14th century in florence, italy. various theories have been proposed to account for its origins and characteristics, focusing on a variety of factors including the social and civic peculiarities of florence at the time: its political structure, the patronage of its dominant family, the medici, and the migration of greek scholars and their texts to italy following the fall of constantinople to the ottoman turks which inherited from the timurid renaissance. other major centres were northern italian city-states such as venice, genoa, milan, bologna, and rome during the renaissance papacy or belgian cities such as bruges, ghent, brussels, leuven or antwerp.the renaissance has a long and complex historiography, and, in line with general scepticism of discrete periodizations, there has been much debate among historians reacting to the 19th-century glorification of the ""renaissance"" and individual cultural heroes as ""renaissance men"", questioning the usefulness of renaissance as a term and as a historical delineation. the art historian erwin panofsky observed of this resistance to the concept of ""renaissance"":it is perhaps no accident that the factuality of the italian renaissance has been most vigorously questioned by those who are not obliged to take a professional interest in the aesthetic aspects of civilization  machiavelli, sought to describe political life as it really was, that is to understand it rationally. a critical contribution to italian renaissance humanism, giovanni pico della mirandola wrote the famous text de hominis dignitate in all, the renaissance could be viewed as an attempt by intellectuals to study and improve the secular and worldly, both through the revival of ideas from antiquity, and through novel approaches to thought. some scholars, such as rodney stark, play down the renaissance in favour of the earlier innovations of the italian city-states in the high middle ages, which married responsive government, christianity and the birth of capitalism. this analysis argues that, whereas the great european states  others see more general competition between artists and polymaths such as brunelleschi, ghiberti, donatello, and masaccio for artistic commissions as sparking the creativity of the renaissance. yet it remains much debated why the renaissance began in italy, and why it began when it did. accordingly, several theories have been put forward to explain its origins.during the renaissance, money and art went hand in hand. artists depended entirely on patrons while the patrons needed money to foster artistic talent. wealth was brought to italy in the 14th, 15th, and 16th centuries by expanding trade into asia and europe. silver mining in tyrol increased the flow of money. luxuries from the muslim world, brought home during the crusades, increased the prosperity of genoa and venice.jules michelet defined the 16th-century renaissance in france as a period in europes cultural history that represented a break from the middle ages, creating a modern understanding of humanity and its place in the world.in stark contrast to the high middle ages, when latin scholars focused almost entirely on studying greek and arabic works of natural science, philosophy and mathematics. renaissance scholars were most interested in recovering and studying latin and greek literary, historical, and oratorical texts. broadly speaking, this began in the 14th century with a latin phase, when renaissance scholars such as petrarch, coluccio salutati  by the early 15th century, the bulk of the surviving such latin literature had been recovered; the greek phase of renaissance humanism was under way, as western european scholars turned to recovering ancient greek literary, historical, oratorical and theological texts.unlike with latin texts, which had been preserved and studied in western europe since late antiquity, the study of ancient greek texts was very limited in medieval western europe. ancient greek works on science, maths and philosophy had been studied since the high middle ages in western europe and in the islamic golden age  one of the greatest achievements of renaissance scholars was to bring this entire class of greek cultural works back into western europe for the first time since late antiquity. muslim logicians had inherited greek ideas after they had invaded and conquered egypt and the levant. their translations and commentaries on these ideas worked their way through the arab west into iberia and sicily, which became important centers for this transmission of ideas. from the 11th to the 13th century, many schools dedicated to the translation of philosophical and scientific works from classical arabic to medieval latin were established in iberia, most notably the toledo school of translators. this work of translation from islamic culture, though largely unplanned and disorganized, constituted one of the greatest transmissions of ideas in history. the movement to reintegrate the regular study of greek literary, historical, oratorical and theological texts back into the western european curriculum is usually dated to the 1396 invitation from coluccio salutati to the byzantine diplomat and scholar manuel chrysoloras  this legacy was continued by a number of expatriate greek scholars, from basilios bessarion to leo allatius.the unique political structures of late middle ages italy have led some to theorize that its unusual social climate allowed the emergence of a rare cultural efflorescence. italy did not exist as a political entity in the early modern period. instead, it was divided into smaller city states and territories: the kingdom of naples controlled the south, the republic of florence and the papal states at the center, the milanese and the genoese to the north and west respectively, and the venetians to the east. fifteenth-century italy was one of the most urbanised areas in europe. many of its cities stood among the ruins of ancient roman buildings; it seems likely that the classical nature of the renaissance was linked to its origin in the roman empires heartland.historian and political philosopher quentin skinner points out that otto of freising even cities and states beyond central italy, such as the republic of florence at this time, were also notable for their merchant republics, especially the republic of venice. although in practice these were oligarchical, and bore little resemblance to a modern democracy, they did have democratic features and were responsive states, with forms of participation in governance and belief in liberty. the relative political freedom they afforded was conducive to academic and artistic advancement. likewise, the position of italian cities such as venice as great trading centres made them intellectual crossroads. merchants brought with them ideas from far corners of the globe, particularly the levant. venice was europes gateway to trade with the east, and a producer of fine glass, while florence was a capital of textiles. the wealth such business brought to italy meant large public and private artistic projects could be commissioned and individuals had more leisure time for study.one theory that has been advanced is that the devastation in florence caused by the black death, which hit europe between 1348 and 1350, resulted in a shift in the world view of people in 14th century italy. italy was particularly badly hit by the plague, and it has been speculated that the resulting familiarity with death caused thinkers to dwell more on their lives on earth, rather than on spirituality and the afterlife. it has also been argued that the black death prompted a new wave of piety, manifested in the sponsorship of religious works of art. however, this does not fully explain why the renaissance occurred specifically in italy in the 14th century. the black death was a pandemic that affected all of europe in the ways described, not only italy. the renaissances emergence in italy was most likely the result of the complex interaction of the above factors.the plague was carried by fleas on sailing vessels returning from the ports of asia, spreading quickly due to lack of proper sanitation: the population of england, then about 4.2 million, lost 1.4 million people to the bubonic plague. florences population was nearly halved in the year 1347. as a result of the decimation in the populace the value of the working class increased, and commoners came to enjoy more freedom. to answer the increased need for labor, workers traveled in search of the most favorable position economically.the demographic decline due to the plague had economic consequences: the prices of food dropped and land values declined by 30 machiavelli and thomas more revived the ideas of greek and roman thinkers and applied them in critiques of contemporary government. pico della mirandola wrote the ""manifesto"" of the renaissance, the oration on the dignity of man, a vibrant defence of thinking. matteo palmieri  this ideology was referred to as the uomo universale, an ancient greco-roman ideal. education during the renaissance was mainly composed of ancient literature and history as it was thought that the classics provided moral instruction and an intensive understanding of human behavior.a unique characteristic of some renaissance libraries is that they were open to the public. these libraries were places where ideas were exchanged and where scholarship and reading were considered both pleasurable and beneficial to the mind and soul. as freethinking was a hallmark of the age, many libraries contained a wide range of writers. classical texts could be found alongside humanist writings. these informal associations of intellectuals profoundly influenced renaissance culture. some of the richest ""bibliophiles"" built libraries as temples to books and knowledge. a number of libraries appeared as manifestations of immense wealth joined with a love of books. in some cases, cultivated library builders were also committed to offering others the opportunity to use their collections. prominent aristocrats and princes of the church created great libraries for the use of their courts, called ""court libraries"", and were housed in lavishly designed monumental buildings decorated with ornate woodwork, and the walls adorned with frescoes the development of perspective was part of a wider trend towards realism in the arts. painters developed other techniques, studying light, shadow, and, famously in the case of leonardo da vinci, human anatomy. underlying these changes in artistic method was a renewed desire to depict the beauty of nature and to unravel the axioms of aesthetics, with the works of leonardo, michelangelo and raphael representing artistic pinnacles that were much imitated by other artists. other notable artists include sandro botticelli, working for the medici in florence, donatello, another florentine, and titian in venice, among others.in the netherlands, a particularly vibrant artistic culture developed. the work of hugo van der goes and jan van eyck was particularly influential on the development of painting in italy, both technically with the introduction of oil paint and canvas, and stylistically in terms of naturalism in representation. later, the work of pieter brueghel the elder would inspire artists to depict themes of everyday life.in architecture, filippo brunelleschi was foremost in studying the remains of ancient classical buildings. with rediscovered knowledge from the 1st-century writer vitruvius and the flourishing discipline of mathematics, brunelleschi formulated the renaissance style that emulated and improved on classical forms. his major feat of engineering was building the dome of the florence cathedral. another building demonstrating this style is the church of st. andrew in mantua, built by alberti. the outstanding architectural work of the high renaissance was the rebuilding of st. peters basilica, combining the skills of bramante, michelangelo, raphael, sangallo and maderno.during the renaissance, architects aimed to use columns, pilasters, and entablatures as an integrated system. the roman orders types of columns are used: tuscan and composite. these can either be structural, supporting an arcade or architrave, or purely decorative, set against a wall in the form of pilasters. one of the first buildings to use pilasters as an integrated system was in the old sacristy  arches, semi-circular or applied innovation extended to commerce. at the end of the 15th century luca pacioli published the first work on bookkeeping, making him the founder of accounting.the rediscovery of ancient texts and the invention of the printing press democratized learning and allowed a faster propagation of more widely distributed ideas. in the first period of the italian renaissance, humanists favoured the study of humanities over natural philosophy or applied mathematics, and their reverence for classical sources further enshrined the aristotelian and ptolemaic views of the universe. writing around 1450, nicholas cusanus anticipated the heliocentric worldview of copernicus, but in a philosophical fashion.science and art were intermingled in the early renaissance, with polymath artists such as leonardo da vinci making observational drawings of anatomy and nature. da vinci set up controlled experiments in water flow, medical dissection, and systematic study of movement and aerodynamics, and he devised principles of research method that led fritjof capra to classify him as the ""father of modern science"". other examples of da vincis contribution during this period include machines designed to saw marbles and lift monoliths, and new discoveries in acoustics, botany, geology, anatomy, and mechanics.a suitable environment had developed to question scientific doctrine. the discovery in 1492 of the new world by christopher columbus challenged the classical worldview. the works of ptolemy  the willingness to question previously held truths and search for new answers resulted in a period of major scientific advancements.some view this as a ""scientific revolution"", heralding the beginning of the modern age, others as an acceleration of a continuous process stretching from the ancient world to the present day. significant scientific advances were made during this time by galileo galilei, tycho brahe and johannes kepler. copernicus, in de revolutionibus orbium coelestium another important development was in the process for discovery, the scientific method, focusing on empirical evidence and the importance of mathematics, while discarding aristotelian science. early and influential proponents of these ideas included copernicus, galileo, and francis bacon. the new scientific method led to great contributions in the fields of astronomy, physics, biology, and anatomy.during the renaissance, extending from 1450 to 1650, every continent was visited and mostly mapped by europeans, except the south polar continent now known as antarctica. this development is depicted in the large world map nova totius terrarum orbis tabula made by the dutch cartographer joan blaeu in 1648 to commemorate the peace of westphalia.in 1492, christopher columbus sailed across the atlantic ocean from spain seeking a direct route to india of the delhi sultanate. he accidentally stumbled upon the americas, but believed he had reached the east indies.in 1606, the dutch navigator willem janszoon sailed from the east indies in the voc ship duyfken and landed in australia. he charted about 3000. throughout the renaissance it had been known as terra australis, or australia for short. however, after that name was transferred to new holland in the nineteenth century, the new name of antarctica was bestowed on the south polar continent.from this changing society emerged a common, unifying musical language, in particular the polyphonic style of the franco-flemish school. the development of printing made distribution of music possible on a wide scale. demand for music as entertainment and as an activity for educated amateurs increased with the emergence of a bourgeois class. dissemination of chansons, motets, and masses throughout europe coincided with the unification of polyphonic practice into the fluid style that culminated in the second half of the sixteenth century in the work of composers such as palestrina, lassus, victoria and william byrd.the new ideals of humanism, although more secular in some aspects, developed against a christian backdrop, especially in the northern renaissance. much, if not most, of the new art was commissioned by or in dedication to the church. however, the renaissance had a profound effect on contemporary theology, particularly in the way people perceived the relationship between man and god. many of the periods foremost theologians were followers of the humanist method, including erasmus, zwingli, thomas more, martin luther, and john calvin.the renaissance began in times of religious turmoil. the late middle ages was a period of political intrigue surrounding the papacy, culminating in the western schism, in which three men simultaneously claimed to be true bishop of rome. while the schism was resolved by the council of constance churchmen such as erasmus and luther proposed reform to the church, often based on humanist textual criticism of the new testament. in october 1517 luther published the 95 theses, challenging papal authority and criticizing its perceived corruption, particularly with regard to instances of sold indulgences. the 95 theses led to the reformation, a break with the roman catholic church that previously claimed hegemony in western europe. humanism and the renaissance therefore played a direct role in sparking the reformation, as well as in many other contemporaneous religious debates and conflicts.pope paul iii came to the papal throne  from petrarchs italian perspective, this new period leonardo bruni was the first to use tripartite periodization in his history of the florentine people  brunis first two periods were based on those of petrarch, but he added a third period because he believed that italy was no longer in a state of decline. flavio biondo used a similar framework in decades of history from the deterioration of the roman empire  the term rinascita  vasari divides the age into three phases: the first phase contains cimabue, giotto, and arnolfo di cambio; the second phase contains masaccio, brunelleschi, and donatello; the third centers on leonardo da vinci and culminates with michelangelo. it was not just the growing awareness of classical antiquity that drove this development, according to vasari, but also the growing desire to study and imitate nature.in the 15th century, the renaissance spread rapidly from its birthplace in florence to the rest of italy and soon to the rest of europe. the invention of the printing press by german printer johannes gutenberg allowed the rapid transmission of these new ideas. as it spread, its ideas diversified and changed, being adapted to local culture. in the 20th century, scholars began to break the renaissance into regional and national movements.in england, the sixteenth century marked the beginning of the english renaissance with the work of writers william shakespeare, christopher marlowe, edmund spenser, sir thomas more, francis bacon, sir philip sidney, as well as great artists, architects in 1495 the italian renaissance arrived in france, imported by king charles viii after his invasion of italy. a factor that promoted the spread of secularism was the inability of the church to offer assistance against the black death. francis i imported italian art and artists, including leonardo da vinci, and built ornate palaces at great expense. writers such as fran. matthias corvinuss library, the bibliotheca corviniana, was europes greatest collections of secular books: historical chronicles, philosophic and scientific works in the 15th century. his library was second only in size to the vatican library.  in 1489, bartolomeo della fonte of florence wrote that lorenzo de medici founded his own greek-latin library encouraged by the example of the hungarian king. corvinuss library is part of unesco world heritage.matthias started at least two major building projects. the works in buda and visegrth-century vladimir cathedral as a model, and he produced a design combining traditional russian style with a renaissance sense of spaciousness, proportion and symmetry.in 1485 ivan iii commissioned the building of the royal residence, terem palace, within the kremlin, with aloisio da milano as the architect of the first three floors. he and other italian architects also contributed to the construction of the kremlin walls and towers. the small banquet hall of the russian tsars, called the palace of facets because of its facetted upper story, is the work of two italians, marco ruffo and pietro solario, and shows a more italian style. in 1505, an italian known in russia as aleviz novyi or aleviz fryazin arrived in moscow. he may have been the venetian sculptor, alevisio lamberti da montagne. he built twelve churches for ivan iii, including the cathedral of the archangel, a building remarkable for the successful blending of russian tradition, orthodox requirements and renaissance style. it is believed that the cathedral of the metropolitan peter in vysokopetrovsky monastery, another work of aleviz novyi, later served as an inspiration for the so-called octagon-on-tetragon architectural form in the moscow baroque of the late 17th century.between the early 16th and the late 17th centuries, an original tradition of stone tented roof architecture developed in russia. it was quite unique and different from the contemporary renaissance architecture elsewhere in europe, though some research terms the style russian gothic and compares it with the european gothic architecture of the earlier period. the italians, with their advanced technology, may have influenced the invention of the stone tented roof by the 17th century the influence of renaissance painting resulted in russian icons becoming slightly more realistic, while still following most of the old icon painting canons, as seen in the works of bogdan saltanov, simon ushakov, gury nikitin, karp zolotaryov and other russian artists of the era. gradually the new type of secular portrait painting appeared, called pars0th century.rapid accumulation of knowledge, which has characterized the development of science since the 17th century, had never occurred before that time. the new kind of scientific activity emerged only in a few countries of western europe, and it was restricted to that small area for about two hundred years. (since the 19th century, scientific knowledge has been assimilated by the rest of the world.interactive resourceslectures and galleries",1,0

return in 2007 to more than $7 billion by 2008, but fell as financial markets collapsed near the start of 2009. by 2011, after missing out on the economic rebound, many key investors pulled out, reducing the value of clariums assets to $350 million, two thirds of which was thiels money.in may 2003, thiel incorporated palantir technologies, a big data analysis company named after the tolkien artifact. he continues to serve as its chairman as of 2020. thiel stated that the idea for the company was based on the realization that ""the approaches that paypal had used to fight fraud could be extended into other contexts, like fighting terrorism"". he also stated that, after the september 11 attacks, the debate in the united states was ""will we have more security with less privacy or less security with more privacy?"". he envisioned palantir as providing data mining services to government intelligence agencies that were maximally unintrusive and traceable.palantirs first backer was the central intelligence agencys venture capital arm in-q-tel, but the company steadily grew and in 2015 was valued at $20 billion. thiel was the companys largest shareholder.in august 2004, thiel made a $500,000 angel investment in facebook for a 10.2% stake in the company and joined facebooks board. this was the first outside investment in facebook, and valued the company at $4.9 million. as a board

which closed before the 2008 financial crisis.in his book the facebook effect, david kirkpatrick outlines how thiel came to make this investment: napster co-founder sean parker, who at the time had assumed the title of ""president"" of facebook, was seeking investors. parker approached reid hoffman, the ceo of work-based social network linkedin. hoffman liked facebook but declined to become lead investor because of the potential for conflict of interest. hoffman directed parker to thiel, whom he knew from their paypal days. thiel met parker and facebook founder mark zuckerberg. thiel and zuckerberg got along well and thiel agreed to lead facebooks seed round with $500,000 for 10.2% of the company. the investment was originally in the form of a convertible note, to be converted to equity if facebook reached 1.5 million users by the end of 2004. although facebook narrowly missed the target, thiel allowed the loan to be converted to equity anyway. thiel said of his investment:i was comfortable with them pursuing their original vision. and it was a very reasonable valuation. i thought it was going to be a pretty safe investment.in september 2010, thiel, while expressing skepticism about the potential for growth in the consumer internet sector, argued that relative to other internet companies, facebook facebooks initial public offering was in may 2012, with a market cap of nearly $100 billion  in august 2012, immediately upon the conclusion of the early investor lock out period, thiel sold almost all of his remaining stake for between $19.27 and $20.69 per share,

november 2017, it was reported that y combinator had severed its ties with thiel. the business-focused publication quartz said: ""while details of the split between  and  remains unclear, the

according to thiel, for many young people, college is the path to take when they have no idea what to do with their lives:i feel i was personally very guilty of this; you dont know what to do with your life, so you get a college degree; you dont know what youre going to do with your college degree, so you get a graduate degree. in my case, it was law school, which is the classic thing one does when one has no idea what else to do. i dont have any big regrets, but if i had to do it over i would try to think more about the future than i did at the time... you cannot get out of student debt even if you personally go bankrupt, its a form of almost like indentured servitude, its attached to your physical person for the rest of your life.in november 2011, the thiel foundation announced the

only 18 republican senators supported the filibuster. to supporters, the move ""signaled the depth of cruzs commitment to rein in government"". this move was extremely popular among cruz supporters, with rick manning of americans for limited government naming cruz ""2013 person of the year"" in an op-ed in the hill, primarily for his filibuster against the affordable care act. cruz was also named ""2013 man of the year"" by conservative publications theblaze, and the american spectator, ""2013 conservative of the year"" by townhall.com, and ""2013 statesman of the year"" by the republican party of sarasota county, florida. he was a finalist for time magazines ""person of the year"" in 2013. to critics, including some republican colleagues such as senator lindsey graham, the move was ineffective.cruz has consistently denied any involvement in the 2013 government shutdown, even though he cast several votes to prolong it and was blamed by many within his own party for prompting it.on april 1, 2014, cruz introduced s. 2195, a bill that would allow the president of the united states to deny visas to any ambassador to the united nations who has been found to have been engaged in espionage or terrorist activity against the united states or its allies and may pose a threat to u.s. national security interests. the bill was written in response to irans choice of hamid aboutalebi as its ambassador. aboutalebi was involved in the iran hostage crisis, in which of a number of american diplomats from the us embassy in tehran were held captive in 1979.under the headline ""a bipartisan message to iran"", cruz thanked president barack obama for signing s. 2195 into law. the letter, published in the magazine politico on april 18, 2014, starts with ""thanks to president obama for joining a unanimous congress and signing s. 2195 into law"". cruz also thanked senators from both political parties for ""swiftly passing this legislation and sending it to the white house"".in his first two years in the senate, cruz attended 17 of 50 public armed services committee hearings, 3 of 25 commerce committee hearings, 4 of the 12 judiciary committee hearings, and missed 21 of 135 roll call votes during the first three months of 2015.in a november 2014 senate speech, cruz accused the president of being ""openly desirous to destroy the constitution and this republic"". in the same speech, cruz invoked the speeches of the ancient roman senator cicero against catiline to denounce obamas planned executive actions on immigration reform. classics professor jesse weiner, writing in the atlantic, said that cruzs analogy was ""deeply disquieting"" because ""in casting obama in the role of catiline, cruz unsubtly suggests that the sitting president was not lawfully elected and is the perpetrator of a violent insurrection to overthrow the government ... in effect, he accuses the president of high treason. regardless of ones views on immigration reform and the obama administration at large, this is dangerous rhetoric.""cruz has repeatedly said that the 2015 international nuclear agreement with iran ""will make the obama administration the worlds leading financier of radical islamic terrorism"". in response, obama called cruzs statements an example of ""outrageous attacks"" from republican critics that crossed the line of responsible discourse: ""weve had a sitting senator, who also happens to be running for president, suggest that im the leading state sponsor of terrorism. maybe this is just an effort to push mr. trump out of the headlines, but its not the kind of leadership that is needed for america right now."" former republican presidential nominee mitt romney also criticized cruzs remarks, writing that although he, too, opposed the iran agreement, cruzs statement connecting obama to terrorism was ""way over the line"" and ""hurts the cause"".after the death of associate justice antonin scalia, cruz said that the winner of the 2016 u.s. presidential election, rather than obama, should appoint a new justice. in june 2016, cruz blamed the obama administration for the orlando nightclub shooting, reasoning that it did not track the perpetrator omar mateen properly while he was on the terrorist watch-list. following the terrorist attack on nice, france, cruz said in a statement that the country was at risk as a result of the obama administration having a ""willful blindness"" to radical islamists. with the passing of fidel castro in november, cruz charged obama with celebrating and lionizing castro in public statements he made addressing the death. on december 28, after secretary of state john kerry gave a speech defending the u.s.s decision to allow a u.n. resolution to pass that condemned israeli settlements ""on land meant to be part of a future palestinian state"", cruz denounced the speech as ""disgraceful"", and said that history would remember obama and kerry as ""relentless enemies of israel"". cruz also accused the obama administration of having a ""radical anti-israel agenda"".cruz, who was one of donald trumps most vocal critics during the 2016 presidential campaign, became an important ally of president trumps in the senate.in late january 2017, cruz praised supreme court nominee neil gorsuch as ""brilliant and immensely talented"" in a written statement. on february 23, while speaking at the 2017 cpac, cruz showed interest in trump nominating young justices in the mold of scalia and clarence thomas. on march 1, he called trumps joint address to congress the previous day ""positive"" and ""unifying"". cruz said that during his visit to the mar-a-lago estate on march 18, he spoke with affiliates of trump while negotiating the american health care act. on april 6, shortly after the shayrat missile strike, he released a statement displaying his interest in having trump appeal to congress to take ""military action in syria"" to prevent islamic terrorists from acquiring weapons stored in syria.in april 2018, in the blurb for trumps entry on the time 100 most influential people of 2017, cruz wrote, ""president trump is doing what he was elected to do: disrupt the status quo."" cruzs authorship of the blurb was criticized by charles pierce of esquire, jay willis of gq, and cnns chris cillizza.in january 2020, after iran attacked two u.s. military bases in iraq, cruz made comments about the change in iran policy under president trump, saying that obamas policy was appeasement and that the missiles used to attack the bases were bought with money the obama administration had given iran.cruz has used harsh rhetoric against fellow republican politicians, and his relationships with various republican members of congress have been strained. in 2013, he called republicans he considered insufficiently resistant to obamas proposals a ""surrender caucus"". he also called fellow republicans ""squishes"" on gun-control issues during a tea party rally. cruzs role in the united states federal government shutdown of 2013 in particular attracted criticism from a number of republican colleagues. republican senator john mccain was reported to have particularly disliked cruz; in a senate floor speech in 2013, mccain denounced cruzs reference to nazis when discussing the affordable care act. in march 2013, mccain also called cruz and others ""wacko birds"" whose beliefs are not ""reflective of the views of the majority of republicans"". during the 2016 republican presidential primaries, john boehner described cruz as ""lucifer in the flesh""; in an interview, lindsey graham said, ""if you killed ted cruz on the floor of the senate, and the trial was in the senate, nobody would convict you.""in a heated senate floor speech in july 2015, cruz accused senate republican leader mitch mcconnell of telling ""a flat-out lie"" over his intentions to reauthorize the export-import bank of the united states, which cruz opposes. ""what we just saw today was an absolute demonstration that not only what he told every republican senator, but what he told the press over and over and over again was a simple lie"", cruz said. his ""incendiary outburst"" was ""unusual in the cordial atmosphere of the senate"", according to reuters. in the same speech, cruz assailed the ""republican majority in both houses of congresses"" for what he called an insufficiently conservative record. his speech, and especially his accusation against mcconnell, was condemned by various senior republican senators, with mccain saying that the speech was ""outside the realm of senate behavior"" and ""a very wrong thing to do"". orrin hatch expressed a similar opinion: ""i dont condone the use of that kind of language against another senator unless they can show definitive proof that there was a lie ... and i know the leader didnt lie."" cruz alleged that mcconnell scheduled a vote on the ex-im bank as part of a deal to persuade democrats like maria cantwell to stop blocking a trade bill; mcconnell denied there was any ""deal"", and that denial was what cruz called a ""lie"". hatch said mcconnell did pledge to help cantwell get a vote on the ex-im bank.among cruzs few close allies in the senate is mike lee of utah. cruz has expressed pride in his reputation for having few allies, saying in june 2015 that he has been vilified for fighting ""the washington cartel"".when boehner resigned from the house in september 2015, cruz expressed his concern that before resigning boehner might have ""cut a deal with nancy pelosi to fund the obama administration for the rest of its tenure"". the next month, the budget agreement passed in the house by a vote of 266 to 187, with unanimous support from democrats and boehner, lifting the debt ceiling through march 2017. cruz called the agreement ""complete and utter surrender"".cruz is one of the senate republicans in favor of the ""nuclear option"", ""to speed up consideration of president trumps nominees"". changing the senates rules to a simple majority vote would ""ensure a quicker pace on trumps court picks"".cruz ran for reelection to a second term in 2018. the primary elections for both parties were held on march 6, 2018. he easily won the republican nomination with over 80% of the vote. he faced the democratic nominee, u.s. representative beto orourke, in the general election. the contest was unusually competitive for an election in texas, with most polls showing cruz only slightly ahead of orourke. the race received significant media attention and became the most expensive u.s. senate election in history.on november 6, 2018, cruz defeated orourke by a margin of 50.9% to 48.3%.in september 2020, trump included cruz on a shortlist, alongside fellow senators tom cotton and josh hawley, for possible appointment to the supreme court. cruz declined consideration for the position.cruz backed the expedited appeal to the supreme court related to the 2020 united states presidential election in pennsylvania filed by u.s. representative mike kelly, arguing that the ""pennsylvania constitution requires in-person voting, except in narrow and defined circumstances. late last year, the pennsylvania legislature passed a law that purported to allow universal mail-in voting, notwithstanding the pennsylvania constitution013, cruz was widely expected to run for the presidency in 2016. on march 14, 2013, he gave the keynote speech at the annual conservative political action conference  he tied for 7th place in the 2013 cpac straw poll on march 16,

south carolina, all early primary states, leading to speculation that he was laying the groundwork for a run for president in 2016. legal analyst jeffrey toobin described cruz as the first potential presidential candidate to emphasize originalism as a major national issue.on april 12, 2014, cruz spoke at the freedom summit, an event organized by americans for prosperity and citizens united. the event was attended by several potential presidential candidates. in his speech, cruz mentioned that latinos, young people and single mothers are the people most affected by the recession, and that the republican party should make outreach efforts to these constituents. he also said that the words ""growth and opportunity"" should be tattooed on the hands of every republican politician.cruz

republican presidential candidate for the 2016 campaign. during the primary campaign, his base of support was mainly among social conservatives, though he had crossover appeal to other factions within his party, including in particular libertarian conservatives.harpercollins published cruzs book a time for truth: reigniting the promise of america on june 30, 2015. the book reached the bestseller

being a citizen of canada on may 14, 2014.several lawsuits and ballot challenges asserting that cruz is ineligible to become u.s. president have been filed. no lawsuit or challenge has been

"the hippopotamus  hippopotamus amphibius, also called the hippo, common hippopotamus or river hippopotamus, is a large, mostly herbivorous, semiaquatic mammal and ungulate native to sub-saharan africa. it is one of only two extant species in the family hippopotamidae, the other being the pygmy hippopotamus  in english, the plural is ""hippopotamuses"", but ""hippopotami"" is also used.hippopotamus is the type genus of the family hippopotamidae. the pygmy hippopotamus belongs to a different genus in hippopotamidae, either choeropsis or hexaprotodon. hippopotamidae are sometimes known as hippopotamids. sometimes, the subfamily hippopotaminae is used. further, some taxonomists group hippos and anthracotheres in the superfamily anthracotheroidea.:39 hippopotamidae are classified along with other even-toed ungulates in the order artiodactyla. other artiodactyls include camels, cattle, deer and pigs, although hippos are not closely related to these groups.five subspecies of hippos have been described based on morphological differences in their skulls and geographical differences::3the suggested subspecies were never widely used or validated by field biologists; the described morphological differences were small enough that they could have resulted from simple variation in nonrepresentative samples.:2 genetic analyses have tested the existence of three of these putative subspecies. a study examining mitochondrial dna from skin biopsies taken from 13 sampling locations, considered genetic diversity and structure among hippo populations across the continent. the authors found low, but significant, genetic differentiation among h. a. amphibius, h. a. capensis, and h. a. kiboko. neither h. a. tschadensis nor h. a. constrictus has been tested.until 1909, naturalists grouped hippos with pigs, based on molar patterns. several lines of evidence, first from blood proteins, then from molecular systematics and dna and the fossil record, show that their closest living relatives are cetaceans  million years ago, with the protowhale pakicetus and other early whale ancestors collectively known as archaeoceti, which eventually underwent aquatic adaptation into the completely aquatic cetaceans. the other branch became the anthracotheres, a large family of four-legged beasts, the earliest of which in the late eocene would have resembled skinny hippos with comparatively small and narrow heads. all branches of the anthracotheres, except that which evolved into hippopotamidae, became extinct during the pliocene without leaving any descendants.a rough evolutionary lineage can be traced from eocene and oligocene species: anthracotherium and elomeryx to the miocene species merycopotamus and libycosaurus and the very latest anthracotheres in the pliocene. merycopotamus, libycosaurus and hippopotamidae can be considered to form a clade, with libycosaurus being more closely related to hippos. their common ancestor would have lived in the miocene, about 20 million years ago. hippopotamidae are therefore deeply nested within the family anthracotheriidae.hippopotamidae are believed to have evolved in africa; the oldest known hippopotamid is the genus kenyapotamus, which lived in africa from 16 to 8 million years ago. while hippopotamid species spread across asia and europe, no hippos have ever been discovered in the americas, although various anthracothere genera emigrated into north america during the early oligocene. from 7.5 to 1.8 million years ago, an ancestor to the modern hippo, archaeopotamus, lived in africa and the middle east.while the fossil record of hippos is still poorly understood, the two modern genera, hippopotamus and choeropsis three species of malagasy hippopotamus became extinct during the holocene on madagascar, one of them within the past 1,000 years. the malagasy hippos were smaller than the modern hippo, likely through the process of insular dwarfism. fossil evidence indicates many malagasy hippos were hunted by humans, a likely factor in their eventual extinction. isolated members of malagasy hippos may have survived in remote pockets; in 1976, villagers described a living animal called the kilopilopitsofy, which may have been a malagasy hippo.three species of hippopotamus, the european hippopotamus  the pleistocene also saw a number of dwarf species evolve on several mediterranean islands, including crete hippos are among the largest living land mammals, being only smaller than elephants and some rhinoceroses. among the extant african megafauna, behind the two african elephant species, they average smaller than the white rhinoceros but are larger by body mass than the black rhinoceros and the giraffe. hippos measure 2.90 to 5.05,000005.hippos have barrel-shaped bodies with short legs and long muzzles. their skeletal structures are graviportal,:8 adapted to carrying their enormous weight, and their specific gravity allows them to sink and move along the bottom of a river. hippopotamuses have small legs  though they are bulky animals, hippos can gallop at 3059 the testes of the males descend only partially and a scrotum is not present. in addition, the penis retracts into the body when not erect. the genitals of the female hippos are unusual in that the vagina is ridged and two large diverticula protrude from the vulval vestibule. the function of these is unknown.:289the hippos jaw is powered by a large masseter and a well-developed digastric; the latter loops up behind the former to the hyoid.:259 the jaw hinge is located far back enough to allow the animal to open its mouth at almost 18059, 263 the hippo is considered to be a pseudoruminant; it has a complex three-chambered stomach but does not ""chew cud"".:22unlike most other semiaquatic animals, hippos have very little hair.:260 the skin is 660 their skin secretes a natural sunscreen substance which is red-coloured. the secretion is sometimes referred to as ""blood sweat"", but is neither blood nor sweat. this secretion is initially colourless and turns red-orange within minutes, eventually becoming brown. two distinct pigments have been identified in the secretions, one red  all hippos, even those with different diets, secrete the pigments, so it does not appear that food is the source of the pigments. instead, the animals may synthesise the pigments from precursors such as the amino acid tyrosine. nevertheless, this natural sunscreen cannot prevent the animals skin from cracking if it stays out of water too long. the secretion does help regulate the body temperature of the hippo and acts as an antibiotic.a hippos lifespan is typically 4077 donna the hippo was one of the oldest living hippos in captivity. she lived at the mesker park zoo in evansville, indiana in the us until her death in 2012 at the age of 61. the oldest hippo recorded was called bertha; she had lived in the manila zoo in the philippines since it first opened in 1959. when she died in 2017, her age was estimated to be 65.hippopotamus amphibius was widespread in north africa and europe during the eemian and late pleistocene until about 30,000 years ago. archaeological evidence exists of its presence in the levant, dating to less than 3,000 years ago.  the species was common in egypts nile region during antiquity, but has since been extirpated. pliny the elder writes that, in his time, the best location in egypt for capturing this animal was in the saite nome; the animal could still be found along the damietta branch after the arab conquest in 639. reports of the slaughter of the last hippo in natal province were made at the end of the 19th century. hippos are still found in the rivers and lakes of the northern democratic republic of the congo, uganda, tanzania and kenya, north through to ethiopia, somalia and sudan, west to the gambia, and south to south africa.genetic evidence suggests that common hippos in africa experienced a marked population expansion during or after the pleistocene, attributed to an increase in water bodies at the end of the era. these findings have important conservation implications as hippo populations across the continent are currently threatened by loss of access to fresh water. hippos are also subject to unregulated hunting and poaching. in may 2006, the hippo was identified as a vulnerable species on the iucn red list drawn up by the international union for conservation of nature the hippo population declined most dramatically in the democratic republic of the congo. by 2005, the population in virunga national park had dropped to 800 or 900 from around 29,000 in the mid-1970s. the decline is attributed to the disruptions caused by the second congo war. the poachers are believed to be mai-mai rebels, poorly paid congolese soldiers, and local militia groups. reasons for poaching include the belief that hippos are harmful to society, as well as financial gain. however, as of 2016, the virunga hippo population appears to have increased, possibly due to greater enforcement and cooperation between fishermen and park authorities. the sale of hippo meat is illegal, but black-market sales are difficult for virunga national park officers to track. hippo meat is considered a delicacy in some areas of central africa and the teeth have become a valued substitute for elephant ivory.in the late 1980s, pablo escobar kept four hippos in a private menagerie at his residence in hacienda n009, two adults and one calf left their herd and, after attacking humans and killing cattle, one of the adults when a photo of the dead hippo became public, it caused considerable controversy among animal rights groups both within the country and abroad, and further plans of culling ceased. alternative methods have been considered, but they are unproven, or difficult and expensive. a wild male hippo was caught, castrated and released again, but it cost about us$50,000. as of 2020, there were no plans by the local government on managing the population, but further studies on their effect on the habitat have been initiated. because of the fast-growing population, conservationists have recommended that a management plan needs to be rapidly developed.in the u.s., representative robert f. broussard of louisiana introduced the ""american hippo bill"" in 1910 to authorise the importation and release of hippopotamus into the bayous of louisiana. broussard argued that the hippos would eat the invasive water hyacinth that was clogging the rivers and also produce meat to help solve the american meat crisis. the chief collaborators and proponents of broussards bill were major frederick russell burnham and captain fritz duquesne. former president theodore roosevelt backed the plan, as did the u.s. department of agriculture, the washington post, and the new york times which praised the taste of hippo as ""like cow bacon"". the ""american hippo bill"" fell just short of being passed.hippos differ from all other large land mammals, being of semiaquatic habits, and spending their days in lakes and rivers.:3 they can be found in both savannah and forest areas. proper habitat requires enough water to submerge in and grass nearby. larger densities of the animals inhabit quiet waters with mostly firm, smooth sloping beaches. male hippos may be found in very small numbers in rapid waters in rocky gorges.:264 hippos mostly live in freshwater habitats, however populations in west africa mostly inhabit estuarine waters and may even be found at sea. with the exception of eating, most of a hippos life occurs in the water. hippos leave the water at dusk and travel inland, sometimes up to 15015 study concluded that hippo dung provides nutrients from terrestrial material for fish and aquatic invertebrates, while a 2018 study found that their dung can be toxic to aquatic life in large quantities, due to absorption of dissolved oxygen in water bodies. because of their size and their habit of taking the same paths to feed, hippos can have a significant impact on the land across which they walk, both by keeping the land clear of vegetation and depressing the ground. over prolonged periods, hippos can divert the paths of swamps and channels.adult hippos move at speeds up to 873:118 however, due to their aggression and size, adult hippos are not usually preyed upon by other animals. cases where large lion prides have successfully preyed on adult hippos have been reported; however, this predation is generally rare. lions occasionally prey on adults at gorongosa national park and calves are sometimes taken at virunga. crocodiles are frequent targets of hippo aggression, probably because they often inhabit the same riparian habitats; crocodiles may be either aggressively displaced or killed by hippos. in turn, beyond cases of killing the seldom unguarded hippo calf, very large nile crocodiles have been verified to occasionally prey on ""half-grown"" hippos and anecdotally perhaps adult female hippos. aggregations of crocodiles have also been seen to dispatch still-living male hippos that have been previously injured in mating battles with other males.studying the interaction of males and females has long been complicated because hippos are not sexually dimorphic; thus females and young males are almost indistinguishable in the field. although hippos lie close to each other, they do not seem to form social bonds except between mothers and daughters, and they are not social animals. the reason they huddle close together is unknown.:49 hippos are territorial only in water, where a male presides over a small stretch of river, on average 25060  when hippos become over-populated or a habitat is reduced, males sometimes attempt infanticide, but this behaviour is not common under normal conditions. incidents of hippo cannibalism have been documented, but this is believed to be the behaviour of distressed or sick hippos.:825 and 50014 case in niger, a boat was capsized by a hippo and 13 people were killed. as hippos will often engage in raiding nearby crops if the opportunity arises, humans may also come in conflict with them on these occasions, with potential for fatalities on both sides.hippos have long been popular zoo animals. the first record of hippos on captivity for display are dated to 3500 bc, in hierakonpolis, egypt. the first zoo hippo in modern history was obaysch, who arrived at the london zoo on 25 may 1850, where he attracted up to 10,000 visitors a day and inspired a popular song, the ""hippopotamus polka"". hippos generally breed well in captivity; birth rates are lower than in the wild, but this is attributed to zoos wanting to limit births, since hippos are relatively expensive to maintain.:129like many zoo animals, hippos were traditionally displayed in concrete exhibits. in the case of hippos, they usually had a pool of water and patch of grass. in the 1980s, zoo exhibits increasingly reflected native habitats. for example, the toledo zoo hippoquarium features a 360,000-us-gallon  in 1987, the toledo zoo saw the first underwater birth by a captive hippo. the exhibit was so popular, the hippos became the logo of the toledo zoo.a red hippo represented the ancient egyptian god set; the thigh is the ""phallic leg of set"", symbolising virility. sets consort tawaret was also seen as part hippo and was a goddess of protection in pregnancy and childbirth, because ancient egyptians recognised the protective nature of a female hippo toward her young. the ijaw people of the niger delta wore masks of aquatic animals like the hippo when practicing their water spirit cults and hippo ivory was used in the divination rituals of the yoruba. the behemoth from the book of job, 40:154 is thought to be based on a hippo.hippos have been the subjects of various african folktales. according to a san story; when the creator assigned each animal its place in nature, the hippos wanted to live in the water, but were refused out of fear that they might eat all the fish. after begging and pleading, the hippos were finally allowed to live in the water on the conditions that they would eat grass instead of fish and would fling their dung so that it can be inspected for fish bones. in a ndebele tale, the hippo originally had long, beautiful hair, but was set on fire by a jealous hare and had to jump into a nearby pool. the hippo lost most of his hair and was too embarrassed to leave the water.ever since obaysch inspired the ""hippopotamus polka"", hippos have been popular animals in western culture for their rotund appearance that many consider comical. stories of hippos such as huberta, which became a celebrity in south africa in the 1930s for trekking across the country; or the tale of owen and mzee, a hippo and tortoise which developed an intimate bond; have amused people who have bought hippo books, merchandise, and many stuffed hippo toys. hippos were mentioned in the novelty christmas song ""i want a hippopotamus for christmas"" that became a hit for child star gayla peevey in 1953. they also feature in the songs ""the hippopotamus"" and ""hippo encore"" by flanders and swann, with the famous refrain ""mud, mud, glorious mud"". they even inspired a popular board game, hungry hungry hippos.hippos have also been popular cartoon characters, where their rotund frames are used for humorous effect. for example, the disney film fantasia featured a ballerina hippo dancing to the opera la gioconda, hanna-barbera created peter potamus. and the madagascar films feature a hippo named gloria. the ""happy hippos"" characters were created in 1987 by the french designer andr\xc3\xa9 roche to be hidden in the ""kinder surprise egg"" of the italian chocolate company ferrero spa.",1,0

"virginia  and mid-atlantic regions of the united states between the atlantic coast and the appalachian mountains. the geography and climate of the commonwealth are shaped by the blue ridge mountains and the chesapeake bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. the capital of the commonwealth is richmond; virginia beach is the most-populous city, and fairfax county is the most-populous political subdivision. the commonwealths estimated population as of 2019 is over 8.54,774.2 square miles  virginia is bordered by maryland and washington, d.c. to the north and east; by the atlantic ocean to the east; by north carolina to the south; by tennessee to the southwest; by kentucky to the west; and by west virginia to the north and west. virginias boundary with maryland and washington, d.c. extends to the low-water mark of the south shore of the potomac river.the states southern border is defined as 36 to 1803, a commission appointed by virginia and tennessee surveyed the area and set their border as a line from the summit of white top mountain to the top of the cumberland mountains. errors discovered in 1856 led virginia to propose a new surveying commission in 1871, but in 1893 the u.s. supreme court decided in favor of the 1803 line in the case virginia v. tennessee. one result of this is the division of the city of bristol between the two states.the chesapeake bay separates the contiguous portion of the commonwealth from the two-county peninsula of virginias eastern shore. the bay was formed from the drowned river valleys of the susquehanna river and the james river. many of virginias rivers flow into the chesapeake bay, including the potomac, rappahannock, york, and james, which create three peninsulas in the bay. sea level rise has eroded the land on virginias islands, which include tangier island in the bay and chincoteague, one of 23 barrier islands on the atlantic coast.the tidewater is a coastal plain between the atlantic coast and the fall line. it includes the eastern shore and major estuaries of chesapeake bay. the piedmont is a series of sedimentary and igneous rock-based foothills east of the mountains which were formed in the mesozoic era. the region, known for its heavy clay soil, includes the southwest mountains around charlottesville. the blue ridge mountains are a physiographic province of the appalachian mountains with the highest points in the commonwealth, the tallest being mount rogers at 5,729 feet  the ridge and valley region is west of the mountains and includes the great appalachian valley. the region is carbonate rock based and includes massanutten mountain. the cumberland plateau and the cumberland mountains are in the southwest corner of virginia, south of the allegheny plateau. in this region, rivers flow northwest, with a dendritic drainage system, into the ohio river basin.the virginia seismic zone has not had a history of regular earthquake activity. earthquakes are rarely above 4.5 in magnitude, because virginia is located away from the edges of the north american plate. a 5.8 magnitude earthquake struck central virginia on august 23, 2011, near mineral, and was the states largest in at least a century. due to the areas geologic properties, the earthquake was felt from northern florida to southern ontario. 35019. the commonwealths carbonate rock is filled with more than 4,000 caves, ten of which are open for tourism, including the popular luray caverns and skyline caverns.virginia has a humid subtropical climate that transitions to humid continental west of the blue ridge mountains. seasonal extremes vary from average lows of 25019. hurricanes and tropical storms can occur from august to october, and though they typically impact coastal regions, the deadliest natural disaster in virginia was hurricane camille, which killed over 150 people in 1969, mainly inland in nelson county. between december and march, cold-air damming caused by the appalachian mountains can lead to significant snowfalls across the state, such as the january 2016 blizzard, which created the states highest recorded snowfall of 36.6 inches  virginia only received 13.1 inches climate change in virginia is leading to higher temperatures year-round as well as more heavy rain and flooding events. urban heat islands can be found in many virginia cities and suburbs, particularly in neighborhoods linked to historic redlining. arlington had the most code orange days in 2019 for high ozone pollution in the air, with 12, followed by fairfax county with 7. exposure of particulate matter in virginias air has decreased 49% from 13.5003 to 6.9 in 2019. the closure and conversion of coal power plants in virginia and the ohio valley region has reduced haze in the mountains, which peaked in 1998. virginias 6 coal power plants must shut down by 2025, and current plans call for 30 percent of the states electricity to be renewable by 2030 and for all of it to be carbon-free by 2050.forests cover 62 percent of virginia as of 2019, of which 78 percent is considered hardwood forest, meaning that trees in virginia are primarily deciduous and broad-leaved. the other 22 percent is pine, with loblolly and shortleaf pine dominating much of central and eastern virginia. in the western and mountainous parts of the commonwealth, oak and hickory are most common, while lower altitudes are more likely to have small but dense stands of moisture-loving hemlocks and mosses in abundance. gypsy moth infestations in oak trees and the blight in chestnut trees have decreased both of their numbers, leaving more room for hickory and invasive ailanthus trees. in the lowland tidewater and piedmont, yellow pines tend to dominate, with bald cypress wetland forests in the great dismal and nottoway swamps. other common trees and plants include red bay, wax myrtle, dwarf palmetto, tulip poplar, mountain laurel, milkweed, daisies, and many species of ferns. the largest areas of wilderness are along the atlantic coast and in the western mountains, where the largest populations of trillium wildflowers in north america are found.virginia is home to more than one million white-tailed deer, whose population have rebounded from an estimated 25,000 to 50,000 during the great depression. native carnivorans include black bears, bobcats, coyotes, both gray and red foxes, raccoons, and skunks. rodents include groundhogs, weasels, nutria, beavers, both gray squirrels and fox squirrels, chipmunks, and allegheny woodrats, while bats include brown bats and the virginia big-eared bat, the state mammal. the virginia opossum is also the only marsupial native to the united states and canada, and the native appalachian cottontail was recognized as a distinct species of rabbit in 1992.virginias bird fauna consists of 422 counted species, of which 359 are regularly occurring, 41 are accidental  there are no species of bird endemic to the state. audubon recognizes 21 important bird areas in the virginia. peregrine falcons, whose numbers dramatically declined due to ddt pesticide poisoning in the middle of the 20th century, are the focus of conservation efforts in the state; as of 2017, virginia had 31 breeding pairs of the bird, and a reintroduction program in shenandoah national park was underway.virginia has 226 species of freshwater fish, from 25 families; the states diverse array of fish species is attributable to its varied and humid climate, physiography, river system interconnections, and lack of pleistocene glaciers. for example, the state is home to eastern blacknose dace and sculpin  the chesapeake bay is host to many species, including blue crabs, clams, oysters, rockfish, as well as the invasive blue catfish. running brooks with rocky bottoms are often inhabited by plentiful amounts of crayfish. amphibians found in virginia include the cumberland plateau salamander and eastern hellbender.virginia has 30 national park service units, such as great falls park and the appalachian trail, and one national park, shenandoah national park. shenandoah was established in 1935 and encompasses the scenic skyline drive. almost forty percent  virginia also has 38 virginia state parks, 3 undeveloped parks, and 63 natural areas, totaling 127,000 acres  all are managed by the virginia department of conservation and recreation except for breaks interstate park. which lies on the virginia-kentucky border and is one of only two inter-state parks in the united states. there are 22 state forests and other state lands managed by the virginia department of forestry, totaling 67,920 acres  the chesapeake bay is not a national park, but is protected by both state and federal legislation and the inter-state chesapeake bay program, which conducts restoration on the bay and its watershed. the great dismal swamp national wildlife refuge extends into north carolina, as does the back bay national wildlife refuge, which marks the beginning of the outer banks.virginia celebrated its quadricentennial year in 2007, marking 400 years since the establishment of the jamestown colony. the observances highlighted contributions from native americans, africans, and europeans, each of which had a significant part in shaping virginias history. warfare, including among these groups, has also had an important role. virginia was a focal point in conflicts from the french and indian war, the american revolution and the civil war, to the cold war and the war on terrorism. fictionalized stories about the early colony, in particular the story of pocahontas and john smith, first became popular in the period after the revolutionary war, and together with other myths surrounding george washingtons childhood and plantation elite in the antebellum period became touchstones of virginian and american culture and helped shape the states historic politics and beliefs.the first people are estimated to have arrived in virginia over 12,000 years ago. by 5,000 years ago more permanent settlements emerged, and farming began by 900 ad. by 1500, the algonquian peoples had founded towns such as werowocomoco in the tidewater region, which they referred to as tsenacommacah. the other major language groups in the area were the siouan to the west, and the iroquoians, who included the nottoway and meherrin, to the north and south. after 1570, the algonquians consolidated under chief powhatan in response to threats from these other groups on their trade network. powhatan controlled more than 30 smaller tribes and more than 150 settlements, who shared a common virginia algonquian language. in 1607, the native tidewater population was between 13,000 and 14,000.several european expeditions, including a group of spanish jesuits, explored the chesapeake bay during the 16th century. in 1583, queen elizabeth i of england granted walter raleigh a charter to plant a colony north of spanish florida. in 1584, raleigh sent an expedition to the atlantic coast of north america. the name ""virginia"" may have been suggested then by raleigh or elizabeth, perhaps noting her status as the ""virgin queen"", and may also be related to a native phrase, ""wingandacoa"", or name, ""wingina"". initially the name applied to the entire coastal region from south carolina to maine, plus the island of bermuda. the london company was incorporated as a joint stock company by the proprietary charter of 1606, which granted land rights to this area. the company financed the first permanent english settlement in the ""new world"", jamestown. named for king james i, it was founded in may 1607 by christopher newport. in 1619, colonists took greater control with an elected legislature, later called the house of burgesses. with the bankruptcy of the london company in 1624, the settlement was taken into royal authority as an english crown colony.life in the colony was perilous, and many died during the starving time in 1609 and the anglo-powhatan wars, including the indian massacre of 1622, which fostered the colonists negative view of all tribes. by 1624, only 3,400 of the 6,000 early settlers had survived. however, european demand for tobacco fueled the arrival of more settlers and servants. the headright system tried to solve the labor shortage by providing colonists with land for each indentured servant they transported to virginia. african workers were first imported to jamestown in 1619 initially under the rules of indentured servitude. the shift to a system of african slavery in virginia was propelled by the legal cases of john punch, who was sentenced to lifetime slavery in 1640 for attempting to escape his servitude, and of john casor, who was claimed by anthony johnson as his servant for life in 1655. slavery first appears in virginia statutes in 1661 and 1662, when a law made it hereditary based on the mothers status.tensions and the geographic differences between the working and ruling classes led to bacons rebellion in 1676, by which time current and former indentured servants made up as much as eighty percent of the population. rebels, largely from the colonys frontier, were also opposed to the conciliatory policy towards native tribes, and one result of the rebellion was the signing at middle plantation of the treaty of 1677, which made the signatory tribes tributary states and was part of a pattern of appropriating tribal land by force and treaty. middle plantation saw the founding of the college of william & mary in 1693 and was renamed williamsburg as it became the colonial capital in 1699. in 1747, a group of virginian speculators formed the ohio company, with the backing of the british crown, to start english settlement and trade in the ohio country west of the appalachian mountains. france, which claimed this area as part of their colony of new france, viewed this as a threat, and the ensuing french and indian war became part of the seven years war the british parliaments efforts to levy new taxes following the french and indian war were deeply unpopular in the colonies. in the house of burgesses, opposition to taxation without representation was led by patrick henry and richard henry lee, among others. virginians began to coordinate their actions with other colonies in 1773, and sent delegates to the continental congress the following year. after the house of burgesses was dissolved by the royal governor in 1774, virginias revolutionary leaders continued to govern via the virginia conventions. on may 15, 1776, the convention declared virginias independence from the british empire and adopted george masons virginia declaration of rights, which was then included in a new constitution. another virginian, thomas jefferson, drew upon masons work in drafting the national declaration of independence.when the american revolutionary war began, george washington was selected to head the colonial army. during the war, the capital was moved to richmond at the urging of governor thomas jefferson, who feared that williamsburgs coastal location would make it vulnerable to british attack. in 1781, the combined action of continental and french land and naval forces trapped the british army on the virginia peninsula, where troops under george washington and comte de rochambeau defeated british general cornwallis in the siege of yorktown. his surrender on october 19, 1781 led to peace negotiations in paris and secured the independence of the colonies.virginians were instrumental in writing the united states constitution. james madison drafted the virginia plan in 1787 and the bill of rights in 1789. virginia ratified the constitution on june 25, 1788. the three-fifths compromise ensured that virginia, with its large number of slaves, initially had the largest bloc in the house of representatives. together with the virginia dynasty of presidents, this gave the commonwealth national importance. in 1790, both virginia and maryland ceded territory to form the new district of columbia, though the virginian area was retroceded in 1846. virginia is called the ""mother of states"" because of its role in being carved into states such as kentucky, which became the 15th state in 1792, and for the numbers of american pioneers born in virginia.in addition to agriculture, slave labor was increasingly used in mining, shipbuilding and other industries. the execution of gabriel prosser in 1800, nat turners slave rebellion in 1831 and john browns raid on harpers ferry in 1859 marked the growing social discontent over slavery and its role in the plantation economy. by 1860, almost half a million people, roughly 314, virginia joined the confederate states of america, which chose richmond as its capital. after the 1861 wheeling convention, 48 counties in the northwest separated to form a new state of west virginia, which chose to remain loyal to the union. virginian general robert e. lee took command of the army of northern virginia in 1862, and led invasions into union territory, ultimately becoming commander of all confederate forces. during the war, more battles were fought in virginia than anywhere else, including bull run, the seven days battles, chancellorsville, and the concluding battle of appomattox court house. after the capture of richmond in april 1865, the state capital was briefly moved to lynchburg, while the confederate leadership fled to danville. virginia was formally restored to the united states in 1870, due to the work of the committee of nine.during the post-war reconstruction era, virginia adopted a constitution which provided for free public schools, and guaranteed political, civil, and voting rights. the populist readjuster party ran an inclusive coalition until the conservative white democratic party gained power after 1883. it passed segregationist jim crow laws and in 1902 rewrote the constitution of virginia to include a poll tax and other voter registration measures that effectively disenfranchised most african americans and many poor european americans. though their schools and public services were segregated and underfunded due to a lack of political representation, african americans were able to unite in communities and take a greater role in virginia society.new economic forces also changed the

oldest in america, are elected by a majority vote in both the house and senate without input from the governor, one way virginias legislature is stronger than its executive. the system consists of a hierarchy from the supreme court of virginia and the court of appeals of virginia to the circuit courts, the trial courts of general jurisdiction, and the lower general district courts and juvenile and domestic relations district courts. the supreme court has seven justices who serve twelve-year terms, with a mandatory retirement age of 73. the supreme court selects its own chief justice from among their seven members, who is informally limited to two four-year terms.the code of virginia is the statutory law, and consists of the codified legislation of the general assembly. the virginia state police is the largest law enforcement agency in virginia. the virginia capitol police is the oldest police department in the united states. the virginia national guard consists of 7,500 soldiers in the virginia army national guard and 1,200 airmen in the virginia air national guard. since the resumption of capital punishment in virginia in 1982, 113 people have been executed, the second highest number in the nation, and three inmates are on the states death row as of 2019. virginia has the fourth lowest violent crime rate and 13th-lowest property crime rate as of 2018 according to fbi data. virginia ended prisoner parole in 1995. as of 2019, virginias rate of recidivism over the 20th century, virginia shifted from a largely rural, politically southern and conservative state to a more urbanized, pluralistic, and politically moderate environment. up until the 1970s, virginia was a racially divided one-party state dominated by the byrd organization, which sought to stymie the political power of northern virginia, perpetuate segregation, and restrict voter registration. the organization used malapportionment to control what areas of the state were over-represented in the general assembly and the u.s. congress until ordered to end the practice by the 1964 u.s. supreme court decision in davis v. mann and the 1965 the virginia supreme court decision in wilkins v. davis respectively.passage of federal civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s, including the voting rights act of 1965, helped end the states jim crow laws which effectively disfranchised african americans. greater enfranchisement and demographic shifts further changed the electorate. in 1980, 56 percent of eligible voters were born in the state; in 2019 that number was 45 percent, a result of strong international immigration and domestic migration into the state.regional differences also play a large part in virginia politics. while urban and growing suburban areas, including much of northern virginia, form the democratic party base, rural southern and western areas moved to support the republican party in response to its ""southern strategy"". rural democratic support has nevertheless persisted in union-influenced roanoke in southwest virginia, college towns such as charlottesville and blacksburg, and the southeastern black belt region. state election seasons traditionally start with the annual shad planking event in wakefield.state elections in virginia occur in odd-numbered years, with executive department elections occurring in years following u.s. presidential elections and senate elections occurring in the years prior to presidential elections, as both have four-year terms. house of delegates elections take place concurrent with each of those elections as members have two-year terms. national politics often play a role in state election outcomes, and virginia has elected governors of the party opposite the u.s. president in ten of the last eleven contests, with only terry mcauliffe beating the trend.mcauliffe, a democrat, was elected governor in the 2013 elections by two percentage points during barack obamas second presidential term. republicans, however, held a super-majority  republicans also held a one-vote majority the state senate, which they then maintained in the 2015 election. eleven house district lines used in these elections, drawn following the 2010 u.s. census, were later judged unconstitutional for discriminating against african americans.the 2017 statewide elections resulted in democrats holding the three highest offices, with outgoing lieutenant governor ralph northam winning the governorship, justin fairfax elected lieutenant governor, and mark herring continuing as attorney general. in concurrent house of delegates elections, democrats flipped fifteen of the republicans previous sixteen-seat majority. control of the house came down to the tied election in the 94th district, which was won by republicans through drawing of lots, giving the party a slim 51018019 elections, the first after several districts were redrawn because of discrimination. voters in 2020 passed a referendum to give control of drawing both congressional and state legislative districts to a commission of eight citizens and four legislators from each of the two major parties, rather than the legislature.though virginia was considered a ""swing state"" in the 2008 presidential election, democratic candidates carried virginias 13 electoral votes in that election and the three since, suggesting the state has shifted to being reliably democratic. virginia had previously voted for republican presidential candidates in 13 out of 14 presidential elections from 1952 to 2004, including 10 in a row from 1968 to 2004, but hasnt voted for a republican candidate statewide since 2009. virginia currently holds its presidential primary election on super tuesday, the same day as thirteen other states, with the most recent held on march 3, 2020.in u.s. congressional elections since 2006, both parties have seen successes. republican senator george allen lost close races in 2006, to democratic newcomer jim webb, and again in 2012, to webbs replacement, former governor tim kaine. in 2008, democrats won both united states senate seats; former governor mark warner was elected to replace retiring republican john warner. in the 2010 mid-term elections, the first under president obama, republicans flipped three united states house of representatives seats from the democrats, while in the 2018 mid-terms, the first under president trump, democrats flipped three seats from republicans. of the states eleven seats in the house of representatives, democrats currently hold seven and republicans hold four.virginia is the most populous u.s. state without a major professional sports league franchise. the reasons for this include the lack of any dominant city or market within the state, the proximity of teams in washington, d.c. and north carolina, and a reluctance to publicly finance stadiums. a proposed arena in virginia beach designed for an nba franchise became the latest unsuccessful sports initiative when the city council there ended support in 2017. norfolk is however host to two minor league teams: the aaa norfolk tides and the echls norfolk admirals. the san francisco giants aa team, the richmond flying squirrels, began play at the diamond in 2010, replacing the aaa richmond braves, who relocated after 2008. additionally, the washington nationals, boston red sox, and cleveland indians also have single-a farm teams in virginia. the richmond kickers, a united soccer league club, have operated since 1993 and are the only team in their league to win both the league championship and the u.s. open cup in the same year.the washington football team have their headquarters in ashburn and their training facility is in richmond, and the washington capitals train at medstar capitals iceplex in ballston. virginia has many professional caliber golf courses including the greg norman course at lansdowne resort and kingsmill resort, home of the kingsmill championship, an lpga tour tournament. nascar currently schedules monster energy nascar cup races on two tracks in virginia: martinsville speedway and richmond raceway. virginia natives currently competing in the series include denny hamlin and elliott sadler.virginia does not allow state appropriated funds to be used for either operational or capital expenses for intercollegiate athletics. despite this, both the virginia cavaliers and virginia tech hokies have been able to field competitive teams in the atlantic coast conference and maintain modern facilities. their rivalry is followed statewide. twelve other universities compete in ncaa division i, particularly in the atlantic 10 conference, big south conference, and colonial athletic association. three historically black schools compete in the division ii central intercollegiate athletic association, and two others the state nickname is its oldest symbol, though it has never been made official by law. virginia was given the title ""dominion"" by king charles ii of england at the time of the restoration, because it had remained loyal to the crown during the english civil war, and the present moniker, ""old dominion"" is a reference to that title. charles supporters were called cavaliers, and ""the cavalier state"" nickname was popularized after the american civil war to romanticize the antebellum period. sports teams from the university of virginia are called the cavaliers. the other nickname, ""mother of presidents"", is also historic, as eight virginians have served as president of the united states, including four of the first five.the states motto, sic semper tyrannis, translates from latin as ""thus always to tyrants"", and is used on the state seal, which is then used on the flag. while the seal was designed in 1776, and the flag was first used in the 1830s, both were made official in 1930. the majority of the other symbols were made official in the late 20th century. the virginia reel is among the square dances classified as the state dance. in 1940, virginia made ""carry me back to old virginny"" the state song, but it was retired in 1997 due to its references to slavery. in march 2015, virginia named ""our great virginia"", which uses the tune of ""oh shenandoah"", as the traditional state song and ""sweet virginia breeze"" as the popular state song.coordinates: 3717131515; -78.8537\xef\xbb\xbf

"christmas  as a religious and cultural celebration among billions of people around the world. a feast central to the christian liturgical year, it is preceded by the season of advent or the nativity fast and initiates the season of christmastide, which historically in the west lasts twelve days and culminates on twelfth night; in some traditions, christmastide includes an octave. christmas day is a public holiday in many of the worlds nations, is celebrated religiously by a majority of christians, as well as culturally by many non-christians, and forms an integral part of the holiday season centered around it.the traditional christmas narrative, the nativity of jesus, delineated in the new testament says that jesus was born in bethlehem, in accordance with messianic prophecies. when joseph and mary arrived in the city, the inn had no room and so they were offered a stable where the christ child was soon born, with angels proclaiming this news to shepherds who then further disseminated the information.although the month and date of jesus birth are unknown, the church in the early fourth century fixed the date as december 25. this corresponds to the date of the winter solstice on the roman calendar. most christians celebrate on december 25 in the gregorian calendar, which has been adopted almost universally in the civil calendars used in countries throughout the world. however, part of the eastern christian churches celebrate christmas on december 25 of the older julian calendar, which currently corresponds to january 7 in the gregorian calendar. for christians, believing that god came into the world in the form of man to atone for the sins of humanity, rather than knowing jesus exact birth date, is considered to be the primary purpose in celebrating christmas.the celebratory customs associated in various countries with christmas have a mix of pre-christian, christian, and secular themes and origins. popular modern customs of the holiday include gift giving; completing an advent calendar or advent wreath; christmas music and caroling; viewing a nativity play; an exchange of christmas cards; church services; a special meal; and the display of various christmas decorations, including christmas trees, christmas lights, nativity scenes, garlands, wreaths, mistletoe, and holly. in addition, several closely related and often interchangeable figures, known as santa claus, father christmas, saint nicholas, and christkind, are associated with bringing gifts to children during the christmas season and have their own body of traditions and lore. because gift-giving and many other aspects of the christmas festival involve heightened economic activity, the holiday has become a significant event and a key sales period for retailers and businesses. the economic impact of christmas has grown steadily over the past few centuries in many regions of the world.""christmas"" is a shortened form of ""christs mass"". the word is recorded as cr5. the first recorded christmas celebration was in rome on december 25, ad 336. in the 3rd century, the date of the nativity was the subject of great interest. around ad 200, clement of alexandria wrote:there are those who have determined not only the year of our lords birth, but also the day; and they say that it took place in the 28th year of augustus, and in the 25th day of  pachon  ... further, others say that he was born on the 24th or 25th of pharmuthi . various factors contributed to the selection of december 25 as a date of celebration: it was the date of the winter solstice on the roman calendar and it was nine months after march 25, the date of the vernal equinox and a date linked to the conception of jesus  it was restored as a legal holiday in england in 1660, but remained disreputable in the minds of many people. in the early 19th century, christmas was reconceived by washington irving, charles dickens, and other authors as a holiday emphasizing family, children, kind-heartedness, gift-giving, and santa claus.christmas does not appear on the lists of festivals given by the early christian writers irenaeus and tertullian. origen and arnobius both fault the pagans for celebrating birthdays, which suggests that christmas was not celebrated in their time. arnobius wrote after ad 297. the chronography of 354 records that a christmas celebration took place in rome in 336.in the east, the birth of jesus was celebrated in connection with the epiphany on january 6. this holiday was not primarily about the nativity, but rather the baptism of jesus. christmas was promoted in the east as part of the revival of orthodox christianity that followed the death of the pro-arian emperor valens at the battle of adrianople in 378. the feast was introduced in constantinople in 379, in antioch by john chrysostom towards the end of the fourth century, probably in 388, and in alexandria in the following century.december 25 was the date of the winter solstice on the roman calendar. a late fourth-century sermon by saint augustine explains why this was a fitting day to celebrate christs nativity: ""hence it is that he was born on the day which is the shortest in our earthly reckoning and from which subsequent days begin to increase in length. he, therefore, who bent low and lifted us up chose the shortest day, yet the one whence light begins to increase.""linking jesus to the sun was supported by various biblical passages. jesus was considered to be the ""sun of righteousness"" prophesied by malachi: ""unto you shall the sun of righteousness arise, and healing is in his wings.""such solar symbolism could support more than one date of birth. an anonymous work known as de pascha computus in the 17th century, isaac newton, who, coincidentally, was born on december 25, argued that the date of christmas may have been selected to correspond with the solstice.according to steven hijmans of the university of alberta, ""it is cosmic symbolism ... which inspired the church leadership in rome to elect the southern solstice, december 25, as the birthday of christ, and the northern solstice as that of john the baptist, supplemented by the equinoxes as their respective dates of conception.""the calculation hypothesis suggests that an earlier holiday held on march 25 became associated with the incarnation.  christmas was then calculated as nine months later. the calculation hypothesis was proposed by french writer louis duchesne in 1889. in modern times, march 25 is celebrated as annunciation. this holiday was created in the seventh century and was assigned to a date that is nine months before christmas, in addition to being the traditional date of the equinox. it is unrelated to the quartodeciman, which had been forgotten by this time. forgotten by everyone except the jews, of course, who continued to observe passover; also a quartodeciman feast.early christians celebrated the life of jesus on a date considered equivalent to 14 nisan  tertullian  the date of the passion was moved to good friday in 165 when pope soter created easter by reassigning the resurrection to a sunday. according to the calculation hypothesis, the celebration of the quartodeciman continued in some areas and the feast became associated with incarnation.the calculation hypothesis is considered academically to be ""a thoroughly viable hypothesis"", though not certain. it was a traditional jewish belief that great men were born and died on the same day, so lived a whole number of years, without fractions: jesus was therefore considered to have been conceived on march 25, as he died on march 25, which was calculated to have coincided with 1421, sextus julius africanus the tractate de solstitia et aequinoctia conceptionis et nativitatis domini nostri iesu christi et iohannis baptistae, falsely attributed to john chrysostom, also argued that jesus was conceived and crucified on the same day of the year and calculated this as march 25. this anonymous tract also states: ""but our lord, too, is born in the month of december5 date to appropriate festivities held by the romans in honor of the sun god sol invictus. this cult was established by aurelian in 274. an explicit expression of this theory appears in an annotation of uncertain date added to a manuscript of a work by 12th-century syrian bishop jacob bar-salibi. the scribe who added it wrote:""it was a custom of the pagans to celebrate on the same 255 to correspond with the roman solar holiday dies natalis solis invicti and was therefore a ""paganization"" that debased the true church. it has been argued that, on the contrary, the emperor aurelian, who in 274 instituted the holiday of the dies natalis solis invicti, did so partly as an attempt to give a pagan significance to a date already important for christians in rome.hermann usener and others proposed that the christians chose this day because it was the roman feast celebrating the birthday of sol invictus. modern scholar s. e. hijmans, however, states that ""while they were aware that pagans called this day the birthday of sol invictus, this did not concern them and it did not play any role in their choice of date for christmas."" moreover, thomas j. talley holds that the roman emperor aurelian placed a festival of sol invictus on december 25 in order to compete with the growing rate of the christian church, which had already been celebrating christmas on that date first. in the judgement of the church of england liturgical commission, the history of religions hypothesis has been challenged by a view based on an old tradition, according to which the date of christmas was fixed at nine months after march 25, the date of the vernal equinox, on which the annunciation was celebrated.with regard to a december religious feast of the deified sun  ""thomas talley has shown that, although the emperor aurelians dedication of a temple to the sun god in the campus martius  the oxford companion to christian thought remarks on the uncertainty about the order of precedence between the religious celebrations of the birthday of the unconquered sun and of the birthday of jesus, stating that the hypothesis that december 25 was chosen for celebrating the birth of jesus on the basis of the belief that his conception occurred on march 25 ""potentially establishes 25 december as a christian festival before aurelians decree, which, when promulgated, might have provided for the christian feast both opportunity and challenge"".many popular customs associated with christmas developed independently of the commemoration of jesus birth, with some claiming that certain elements have origins in pre-christian festivals that were celebrated by pagan populations who were later converted to christianity. the prevailing atmosphere of christmas has also continually evolved since the holidays inception, ranging from a sometimes raucous, drunken, carnival-like state in the middle ages, to a tamer family-oriented and children-centered theme introduced in a 19th-century transformation. the celebration of christmas was banned on more than one occasion within certain groups, such as the puritans and jehovahs witnesses prior to and through the early christian centuries, winter festivals were the most popular of the year in many european pagan cultures. reasons included the fact that less agricultural work needed to be done during the winter, as well as an expectation of better weather as spring approached. celtic winter herbs such as mistletoe and ivy, and the custom of kissing under a mistletoe, are common in modern christmas celebrations in the english-speaking countries.the pre-christian germanic peoplesth century, these traditions transferred again to the twelve days of christmas the prominence of christmas day increased gradually after charlemagne was crowned emperor on christmas day in 800. king edmund the martyr was anointed on christmas in 855 and king william i of england was crowned on christmas day 1066.by the high middle ages, the holiday had become so prominent that chroniclers routinely noted where various magnates celebrated christmas. king richard ii of england hosted a christmas feast in 1377 at which twenty-eight oxen and three hundred sheep were eaten. the yule boar was a common feature of medieval christmas feasts. caroling also became popular, and was originally performed by a group of dancers who sang. the group was composed of a lead singer and a ring of dancers that provided the chorus. various writers of the time condemned caroling as lewd, indicating that the unruly traditions of saturnalia and yule may have continued in this form. ""misrule""9, the anglican poet john milton penned on the morning of christs nativity, a poem that has since been read by many during christmastide. donald heinz, a professor at california state university, states that martin luther ""inaugurated a period in which germany would produce a unique culture of christmas, much copied in north america."" among the congregations of the dutch reformed church, christmas was celebrated as one of the principal evangelical feasts.however, in 17th century england, some groups such as the puritans, strongly condemned the celebration of christmas, considering it a catholic invention and the ""trappings of popery"" or the ""rags of the beast"". in contrast, the established anglican church ""pressed for a more elaborate observance of feasts, penitential seasons, and saints days. the calendar reform became a major point of tension between the anglican party and the puritan party."" the catholic church also responded, promoting the festival in a more religiously oriented form. king charles i of england directed his noblemen and gentry to return to their landed estates in midwinter to keep up their old-style christmas generosity. following the parliamentarian victory over charles i during the english civil war, englands puritan rulers banned christmas in 1647.protests followed as pro-christmas rioting broke out in several cities and for weeks canterbury was controlled by the rioters, who decorated doorways with holly and shouted royalist slogans. the book, the vindication of christmas the restoration of king charles ii in 1660 ended the ban, but many calvinist clergymen still disapproved of christmas celebration. as such, in scotland, the presbyterian church of scotland discouraged the observance of christmas, and though james vi commanded its celebration in 1618, attendance at church was scant. the parliament of scotland officially abolished the observance of christmas in 1640, claiming that the church had been ""purged of all superstitious observation of days"". it was not until 1958 that christmas again became a scottish public holiday.following the restoration of charles ii, poor robins almanack contained the lines: ""now thanks to god for charles return, / whose absence made old christmas mourn. / for then we scarcely did it know, / whether it christmas were or no."" the diary of james woodforde, from the latter half of the 18th century, details the observance of christmas and celebrations associated with the season over a number of years.in colonial america, the pilgrims of new england shared radical protestant disapproval of christmas. the plymouth pilgrims put their loathing for the day into practice in 1620 when they spent their first christmas day in the new world working 0s by several short stories by washington irving which appear in his the sketch book of geoffrey crayon, gent. and ""old christmas"". irvings stories depicted harmonious warm-hearted english christmas festivities he experienced while staying in aston hall, birmingham, england, that had largely been abandoned, and he used the tract vindication of christmas in 1822, clement clarke moore wrote the poem a visit from st. nicholas the poem helped popularize the tradition of exchanging gifts, and seasonal christmas shopping began to assume economic importance.this also started the cultural conflict between the holidays spiritual significance and its associated commercialism that some see as corrupting the holiday. in her 1850 book the first christmas in new england, harriet beecher stowe includes a character who complains that the true meaning of christmas was lost in a shopping spree.while the celebration of christmas was not yet customary in some regions in the u.s., henry wadsworth longfellow detected ""a transition state about christmas here in new england"" in 1856. ""the old puritan feeling prevents it from being a cheerful, hearty holiday; though every year makes it more so.""in reading, pennsylvania, a newspaper remarked in 1861, ""even our presbyterian friends who have hitherto steadfastly ignored christmas8, 1870, christmas was formally declared a united states federal holiday.up to the 1950s in the uk, many christmas customs were restricted to the upper classes and better-off families. the mass of the population had not adopted many of the christmas rituals that later became general. the christmas tree was rare. christmas dinner might be beef or goose . post was still delivered on christmas day until 1961. league football matches continued in scotland until the 1970s while in england they ceased at the end of the 1950s.under the state atheism of the soviet union, after its foundation in 1917, christmas celebrations0s, 30s, and 40s, the league of militant atheists encouraged school pupils to campaign against christmas traditions, such as the christmas tree, as well as other christian holidays, including easter; the league established an antireligious holiday to be the 31st of each month as a replacement. at the height of this persecution, in 1929, on christmas day, children in moscow were encouraged to spit on crucifixes as a protest against the holiday. it was not until the dissolution of the soviet union in 1991 that the persecution ended and orthodox christmas became a state holiday again for the first time in russia after seven decades.european history professor joseph perry wrote that likewise, in nazi germany, ""because nazi ideologues saw organized religion as an enemy of the totalitarian state, propagandists sought to deemphasize0th century, some muslim-majority countries subsequently banned the practice of christmas, claiming it undermines islam.christmas day is celebrated as a major festival and public holiday in countries around the world, including many whose populations are mostly non-christian. in some non-christian areas, periods of former colonial rule introduced the celebration  as such, for christians, attending a christmas eve or christmas day church service plays an important part in the recognition of the christmas season. christmas, along with easter, is the period of highest annual church attendance. a 2010 survey by lifeway christian resources found that six in ten americans attend church services during this time. in the united kingdom, the church of england reported an estimated attendance of 2.5 million people at christmas services in 2015.nativity scenes are known from 10th-century rome. they were popularised by saint francis of assisi from 1223, quickly spreading across europe. different types of decorations developed across the christian world, dependent on local tradition and available resources, and can vary from simple representations of the crib to far more elaborate sets 23. in that year, francis of assisi assembled a nativity scene outside of his church in italy and children sung christmas carols celebrating the birth of jesus. each year, this grew larger and people travelled from afar to see francis depiction of the nativity of jesus that came to feature drama and music. nativity plays eventually spread throughout all of europe, where they remain popular. christmas eve and christmas day church services often came to feature nativity plays, as did schools and theatres. in france, germany, mexico and spain, nativity plays are often reenacted outdoors in the streets.the earliest extant specifically christmas hymns appear in fourth-century rome. latin hymns such as ""veni redemptor gentium"", written by ambrose, archbishop of milan, were austere statements of the theological doctrine of the incarnation in opposition to arianism. ""corde natus ex parentis""  in the 9th and 10th centuries, the christmas ""sequence"" or ""prose"" was introduced in north european monasteries, developing under bernard of clairvaux into a sequence of rhymed stanzas. in the 12th century the parisian monk adam of st. victor began to derive music from popular songs, introducing something closer to the traditional christmas carol.the songs now known specifically as carols were originally communal folk songs sung during celebrations such as ""harvest tide"" as well as christmas. it was only later that carols began to be sung in church. traditionally, carols have often been based on medieval chord patterns, and it is this that gives them their uniquely characteristic musical sound. some carols like ""personent hodie"", ""good king wenceslas"", and ""the holly and the ivy"" can be traced directly back to the middle ages. they are among the oldest musical compositions still regularly sung. ""adeste fideles"" completely secular christmas seasonal songs emerged in the late 18th century. ""deck the halls"" dates from 1784, and the american ""jingle bells"" was copyrighted in 1857. in the 19th and 20th centuries, african american spirituals and songs about christmas, based in their tradition of spirituals, became more widely known. an increasing number of seasonal holiday songs were commercially produced in the 20th century, including jazz and blues variations. in addition, there was a revival of interest in early music, from groups singing folk music, such as the revels, to performers of early medieval and classical music. john rutter has composed many carols including ""all bells in paradise"", ""angels carol"", ""candlelight carol"", ""donkey carol"", ""jesus child"", ""shepherds pipe carol"" and ""star carol"".a special christmas family meal is traditionally an important part of the holidays celebration, and the food that is served varies greatly from country to country. some regions have special meals for christmas eve, such as sicily, where 12 kinds of fish are served. in the united kingdom and countries influenced by its traditions, a standard christmas meal includes turkey, goose or other large bird, gravy, potatoes, vegetables, sometimes bread and cider. special desserts are also prepared, such as christmas pudding, mince pies, christmas cake, panettone and yule log cake. traditional christmas meal in central europe is fried carp or other fish.christmas cards are illustrated messages of greeting exchanged between friends and family members during the weeks preceding christmas day. the traditional greeting reads ""wishing you a merry christmas and a happy new year"", much like that of the first commercial christmas card, produced by sir henry cole in london in 1843. the custom of sending them has become popular among a wide cross-section of people with the emergence of the modern trend towards exchanging e-cards.christmas cards are purchased in considerable quantities and feature artwork, commercially designed and relevant to the season. the content of the design might relate directly to the christmas narrative, with depictions of the nativity of jesus, or christian symbols such as the star of bethlehem, or a white dove, which can represent both the holy spirit and peace on earth. other christmas cards are more secular and can depict christmas traditions, mythical figures such as santa claus, objects directly associated with christmas such as candles, holly, and baubles, or a variety of images associated with the season, such as christmastide activities, snow scenes, and the wildlife of the northern winter. there are even humorous cards and genres depicting nostalgic scenes of the past such as crinolined shoppers in idealized 19th-century streetscapes.some prefer cards with a poem, prayer, or biblical verse; while others distance themselves from religion with an all-inclusive ""seasons greetings"".a number of nations have issued commemorative stamps at christmastide. postal customers will often use these stamps to mail christmas cards, and they are popular with philatelists. these stamps are regular postage stamps, unlike christmas seals, and are valid for postage year-round. they usually go on sale sometime between early october and early december and are printed in considerable quantities.the exchanging of gifts is one of the core aspects of the modern christmas celebration, making it the most profitable time of year for retailers and businesses throughout the world. on christmas, people exchange gifts based on the christian tradition associated with saint nicholas, and the gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh which were given to the baby jesus by the magi. the practice of gift giving in the roman celebration of saturnalia may have influenced christian customs, but on the other hand the christian ""core dogma of the incarnation, however, solidly established the giving and receiving of gifts as the structural principle of that recurrent yet unique event"", because it was the biblical magi, ""together with all their fellow men, who received the gift of god through mans renewed participation in the divine life.""a number of figures are associated with christmas and the seasonal giving of gifts. among these are father christmas, also known as santa claus  among other saintly attributes, he was noted for the care of children, generosity, and the giving of gifts. his feast day, december 6, came to be celebrated in many countries with the giving of gifts.saint nicholas traditionally appeared in bishops attire, accompanied by helpers, inquiring about the behaviour of children during the past year before deciding whether they deserved a gift or not. by the 13th century, saint nicholas was well known in the netherlands, and the practice of gift-giving in his name spread to other parts of central and southern europe. at the reformation in 16th020, there is a difference of 13 days between the julian calendar and the modern gregorian calendar, which is used internationally for most secular purposes. as a result, december 25 on the julian calendar currently corresponds to january 7 on the calendar used by most governments and people in everyday life. therefore, the aforementioned orthodox christians mark december 25 however, other orthodox christians, such as those belonging to the jurisdictions of constantinople, bulgaria, greece, romania, antioch, alexandria, albania, cyprus, finland, and the orthodox church in america, among others, began using the revised julian calendar in the early 20th century, which at present corresponds exactly to the gregorian calendar. therefore, these orthodox christians mark december 25 christmas is typically a peak selling season for retailers in many nations around the world. sales increase dramatically as people purchase gifts, decorations, and supplies to celebrate. in the united states, the ""christmas shopping season"" starts as early as october. in canada, merchants begin advertising campaigns just before halloween  in the united states, it has been calculated that a quarter of all personal spending takes place during the christmas/holiday shopping season. figures from the u.s. census bureau reveal that expenditure in department stores nationwide rose from $20.8004 to $31.9004, an increase of 54 percent. in other sectors, the pre-christmas increase in spending was even greater, there being a november0.8002. for 2019, the average us adult was projected to spend $920 on gifts alone. in the uk in 2010, up to 018, officials raided christian churches just prior to christmastide and coerced them to close; christmas trees and santa clauses were also forcibly removed.(federal = federal holidays, (abbreviation = state/territorial holidays, (religious = religious holidays, (cultural = holiday related to a specific racial/ethnic group or sexual minority, (week = week-long holidays, (month = month-long holidays, (36 = title 36 observances and ceremoniesbold indicates major holidays commonly celebrated in the united states, which often represent the major celebrations of the month.",1,0
"a pig is any of the animals in the genus sus, within the even-toed ungulate family suidae. pigs include domestic pigs and their ancestor, the common eurasian wild boar  pigs are highly social and intelligent animals.with around 1 billion individuals alive at any time, the domestic pig is among the most populous large mammals in the world. pigs are omnivores and can consume a wide range of food. pigs are biologically similar to humans and are thus frequently used for human medical research.the online etymology dictionary provides anecdotal evidence as well as linguistic, saying that the term derivesprobably from old english *picg, found in compounds, ultimate origin unknown. originally ""young pig"" . synonyms grunter, oinker are from sailors and fishermens euphemistic avoidance of uttering the word pig at sea, a superstition perhaps based on the fate of the gadarene swine, who drowned.the online etymology dictionary also traces the evolution of sow, the term for a female pig, through various historical languages:old english sugu, su ""female of the swine,"" from proto-germanic *su- an adjectival form is porcine. another adjectival form  the snout is used to dig into the soil to find food and is a very acute sense organ.  there are four hoofed toes on each foot, with the two larger central toes bearing most of the weight, but the outer two also being used in soft ground.the dental formula of adult pigs is 3.1.4.33.1.4.3, giving a total of 44 teeth. the rear teeth are adapted for crushing.  in the male, the canine teeth form tusks, which grow continuously and are sharpened by constantly being ground against each other.occasionally, captive mother pigs may savage their own piglets, often if they become severely stressed. some attacks on newborn piglets are non-fatal.  others may cause the death of the piglets and sometimes, the mother may eat the piglets. it is estimated that 50% of piglet fatalities are due to the mother attacking, or unintentionally crushing, the newborn pre-weaned animals.with around 1 billion individuals alive at any time, the domestic pig is one of the most numerous large mammals on the planet.the ancestor of the domestic pig is the wild boar, which is one of the most numerous and widespread large mammals.  its many subspecies are native to all but the harshest climates of continental eurasia and its islands and africa as well, from ireland and india to japan and north to siberia.long isolated from other pigs on the many islands of indonesia, malaysia, and the philippines, pigs have evolved into many different species, including wild boar, bearded pigs, and warty pigs. humans have introduced pigs into australia, north and south america, and numerous islands, either accidentally as escaped domestic pigs which have gone feral, or as wild boar.the wild boar pigs are omnivores, which means that they consume both plants and animals. in the wild, they are foraging animals, primarily eating leaves, roots, fruits, and flowers, in addition to some insects and fish.  as livestock, pigs are fed mostly corn and soybean meal with a mixture of vitamins and minerals added to the diet. traditionally, they were raised on dairy farms and called ""mortgage lifters"", due to their ability to use the excess milk as well as whey from cheese and butter making combined with pasture. older pigs will consume three to five gallons of water per day. when kept as pets, the optimal healthy diet consists mainly of a balanced diet of raw vegetables, although some may give their pigs conventional mini pig pellet feed.domesticated pigs, especially miniature breeds, are commonly kept as pets. domestic pigs are raised commercially as livestock; materials that are garnered include their meat human skin is very similar to pig skin, therefore pig skin has been used in many preclinical studies. in addition to providing use in biomedical research and for drug testing, genetic advances in human healthcare have provided a pathway for domestic pigs to become xenotransplantation candidatesfor humans.the genus sus is currently thought to contain eight living species. a number of extinct species pigs have been domesticated since ancient times in the old world. archaeological evidence suggests that pigs were being managed in the wild in a way similar to the way they are managed by some modern new guineans from wild boar as early as 13,000,700 bp in the near east in the tigris basin, 015, a study looked at over 100 pig genome sequences to ascertain their process of domestication. the process of domestication was assumed to have been initiated by humans, involved few individuals and relied on reproductive isolation between wild and domestic forms. the study found that the assumption of reproductive isolation with population bottlenecks was not supported. the study  indicated that pigs were domesticated separately in western asia and china, with western asian pigs introduced into europe where they crossed with wild boar. a model that fitted the data included admixture with a now extinct ghost population of wild pigs during the pleistocene. the study also found that despite back-crossing with wild pigs, the genomes of domestic pigs have strong signatures of selection at dna loci that affect behavior and morphology. the study concluded that human selection for domestic traits likely counteracted the homogenizing effect of gene flow from wild boars and created domestication islands in the genome. the same process may also apply to other domesticated animals.pigs have been important in culture across the world since neolithic times. they appear in art, literature, and religion. in asia the wild boar is one of 12 animal images comprising the chinese zodiac, while in europe the boar represents a standard charge in heraldry. in islam and judaism pigs and those who handle them are viewed negatively, and the consumption of pork is forbidden. pigs are alluded to in animal epithets and proverbs. the pig has been celebrated throughout europe since ancient times in its carnivals, the name coming from the italian carne levare, the lifting of meat.pigs have been brought into literature for varying reasons, ranging from the pleasures of eating, as in charles lambs a dissertation upon roast pig, to william goldings lord of the flies domestic pigs that have escaped from urban areas or were allowed to forage in the wild, and in some cases wild boars which were introduced as prey for hunting, have given rise to large populations of feral pigs in north and south america, australia, new zealand, hawaii, and other areas where pigs are not native. accidental or deliberate releases of pigs into countries or environments where they are an alien species have caused extensive environmental change. their omnivorous diet, aggressive behaviour, and their feeding method of rooting in the ground all combine to severely alter ecosystems unused to pigs. pigs will even eat small animals and destroy nests of ground nesting birds. the invasive species specialist group lists feral pigs on the list of the worlds 100 worst invasive species and says:feral pigs like other introduced mammals are major drivers of extinction and ecosystem change. they have been introduced into many parts of the world, and will damage crops and home gardens as well as potentially spreading disease. they uproot large areas of land, eliminating native vegetation and spreading weeds. this results in habitat alteration, a change in plant succession and composition and a decrease in native fauna dependent on the original habitat.because of the biological similarities between each other, pigs can harbour a range of parasites and diseases that can be transmitted to humans. these include trichinosis, taenia solium, cysticercosis, and brucellosis. pigs are also known to host large concentrations of parasitic ascarid worms in their digestive tract.some strains of influenza are endemic in pigs. pigs also can acquire human influenza.",1,0
"group dynamics is a system of behaviors and psychological processes occurring within a social group  group dynamics are at the core of understanding racism, sexism, and other forms of social prejudice and discrimination. these applications of the field are studied in psychology, sociology, anthropology, political science, epidemiology, education, social work, business and managerial studies, as well as communication studies.the history of group dynamics  has a consistent, underlying premise: the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. a social group is an entity that has qualities which cannot be understood just by studying the individuals that make up the group. in 1924, gestalt psychologist max wertheimer proposed 0, floyd allport found that although people in groups were more productive than individuals, the quality of their product/effort was inferior.in 1965, robert zajonc expanded the study of arousal response zajonc observed two categories of behaviours, proposed the evaluation apprehension model whereby he suggested people associate social situations with an evaluative process. cottrell argued this situation is met with apprehension and it is this motivational response, not arousal/elevated drive, that is responsible for increased productivity on simple tasks and decreased productivity on complex tasks in the presence of others.in the presentation of self in everyday life distraction-conflict theory contends that when a person is working in the presence of other people, an interference effect occurs splitting the individuals attention between the task and the other person. on simple tasks, where the individual is not challenged by the task, the interference effect is negligible and performance, therefore, is facilitated. on more complex tasks, where drive is not strong enough to effectively compete against the effects of distraction, there is no performance gain. the stroop task social orientation theory considers the way a person approaches social situations. it predicts that self-confident individuals with a positive outlook will show performance gains through social facilitation, whereas a self-conscious individual approaching social situations with apprehension is less likely to perform well due to social interference effects.intergroup dynamics  similarly, underlying the 1999 columbine high school shooting in littleton, colorado, united states, intergroup dynamics played a significant role in eric harris\x80\x99s jigsaw classroom also uses this strategy of interdependence. in 1971, thick racial tensions were abounding in austin, texas. aronson was brought in to examine the nature of this tension within schools, and to devise a strategy for reducing it (so to improve the process of school integration, mandated under brown v. board of education in 1954. despite strong evidence for the effectiveness of the jigsaw classroom, the strategy was not widely used (arguably because of strong attitudes existing outside of the schools, which still resisted the notion that racial and ethnic minority groups are equal to whites and, similarly, should be integrated into schools.",1,0
"all other species in caninifoxes are small to medium-sized, omnivorous mammals belonging to several genera of the family canidae. foxes have a flattened skull, upright triangular ears, a pointed, slightly upturned snout, and a long bushy tail  foxes live on every continent except antarctica. by far the most common and widespread species of fox is the red fox  the global distribution of foxes, together with their widespread reputation for cunning, has contributed to their prominence in popular culture and folklore in many societies around the world. the hunting of foxes with packs of hounds, long an established pursuit in europe, especially in the british isles, was exported by european settlers to various parts of the new world.the word fox comes from old english, which derived from proto-germanic *fuhsaz. this in turn derives from proto-indo-european *pu = 42. in the wild, the typical lifespan of a fox is one to three years, although individuals may live up to ten years. unlike many canids, foxes are not always pack animals. typically, they live in small family groups, but some foxes are omnivores. their diet is made up primarily of invertebrates such as insects and small vertebrates such as reptiles and birds. they may also eat eggs and vegetation. many species are generalist predators, but some  while hunting, foxes tend to use a particular pouncing technique, such that they crouch down to camouflage themselves in the terrain and then use their hind legs to leap up with great force and land on top of their chosen prey. using their pronounced canine teeth, they can then grip the preys neck and shake it until it is dead or can be readily disemboweled.the gray fox is one of only two canine species known to regularly climb trees; the other is the raccoon dog.the male foxs scrotum is held up close to the body with the testes inside even after they descend. like other canines, the male fox has a baculum, or penile bone. the testes of red foxes are smaller than those of arctic foxes. sperm formation in red foxes begins in august to 53 days. foxes tend to have an average litter size of four to five with an 80 percent success rate in becoming pregnant. litter sizes can vary greatly according to species and environment0 lactiferous ducts, which connect the mammary gland to the nipple, allowing for milk to be carried to the nipple.the foxs vocal repertoire is vast:in the case of domesticated foxes, the whining seems to remain in adult individuals as a sign of excitement and submission in the presence of their owners.canids commonly known as foxes include the following genera and species:several fox species are endangered in their native environments. pressures placed on foxes include habitat loss and being hunted for pelts, other trade, or control. due in part to their opportunistic hunting style and industriousness, foxes are commonly resented as nuisance animals. on the other hand, foxes, while often considered pests themselves, have been successfully employed to control pests on fruit farms while leaving the fruit intact.the island fox, though considered a near-threatened species throughout the world, is becoming increasingly endangered in its endemic environment of the california channel islands. a population on an island is smaller than those on the mainland because of limited resources like space, food and shelter. island populations, therefore, are highly susceptible to external threats ranging from introduced predatory species and humans to extreme weather. on the california channel islands, it was found that the population of the island fox was so low due to an outbreak of canine distemper virus from 1999 to 2000 as well as predation by non-native golden eagles. since 1993, the eagles have caused the population to decline by as much as 95%. because of the low number of foxes, the population went through an allee effect; this is where at low enough densities, an individuals fitness decreases. conservationists, therefore, had to take healthy breeding pairs out of the wild population to breed them in captivity until they had enough foxes to release back into the wild. nonnative grazers were also removed so that native plants would be able to grow back to their natural height, thereby providing adequate cover and protection for the foxes against golden eagles.darwins fox is considered critically endangered because of their small known population of 250 mature individuals as well as their restricted distribution. on the chilean mainland, the population is limited to nahuelbuta national park and the surrounding valdivian rainforest. similarly on chilo\x80\x94a reputation derived especially from their reputed ability to evade hunters. this is usually represented as a character possessing these traits. these traits are used on a wide variety of characters, either making them a nuisance to the story, a misunderstood hero, or a devious villain.in asian folklore, foxes are depicted as familiar spirits possessing magic powers. similar to in western folklore, foxes are portrayed as mischievous, usually tricking other people, with the ability to disguise as an attractive female human. however, there are other depictions of foxes as mystical, sacred creatures that can either bring wonder or ruin. nine-tailed foxes appear in chinese folklore, literature, and mythology, in which, depending on the tale, they can be a good or a bad omen. the motif was eventually introduced from chinese to japanese and korean cultures.the constellation vulpecula represents a fox.",1,0
"a college  whereas in the united kingdom, oceania, south asia, southern africa, most of europe and africa, and canada, ""college"" may refer to a high school or secondary school, a college of further education, a training institution that awards trade qualifications, a higher-education provider that does not have university status  thus meaning ""selected together"". thus ""colleagues"" are literally ""persons who have been selected to work together"". in ancient rome a collegium was a""body, guild, corporation united in colleagueship; of magistrates, praetors, tribunes, priests, augurs; a political club or trade guild"". thus a college was a form of corporation or corporate body, an artificial legal person within higher education, the term can be used to refer to:a sixth form college or college of further education is an educational institution in england, wales, northern ireland, belize, the caribbean, malta, norway, brunei, or southern africa, among others, where students aged 16 to 19 typically study for advanced school-level qualifications, such as a-levels, btec, hnd or its equivalent and the international baccalaureate diploma, or school-level qualifications such as gcses. in singapore and india, this is known as a junior college. the municipal government of the city of paris uses the phrase ""sixth form college"" as the english name for a lyc1st century, omitting the word college from its name.the word college continues to be used in the names public separate secondary schools in ontario. a number of independent schools across canada also use the word college in its name.public secular school boards in ontario also refer to their secondary schools as collegiate institutes. however, usage of the word collegiate institute varies between school boards. collegiate institute is the predominant name for secondary schools in lakehead district school board, and toronto district school board, although most school boards in ontario use collegiate institute alongside high school, and secondary school in the names of their institutions. similarly, secondary schools in regina, and saskatoon are referred to as collegiate.in chile, the term ""college"" is usually used in the name of some bilingual schools, like santiago college, saint georges college etc.since 2009 the pontifical catholic university of chile incorporated college as a bachelors degree, it has a bachelor of natural sciences and mathematics, a bachelor of social science and a bachelor of arts and humanities. it has the same system as the american universities, it combines majors and minors. and it let the students continue a higher degree in the same university once finished.kollegio  kollegio in india, the term ""college"" is commonly reserved for institutions that offer high school diplomas at year 12 in ireland the term ""college"" is normally used to describe an institution of tertiary education. university students often say they attend ""college"" rather than ""university"". until 1989, no university provided teaching or research directly; they were formally offered by a constituent college of the university.there are number of secondary education institutions that traditionally used the word ""college"" in their names: these are either older, private schools  which offer both further and higher education qualifications. these degrees and diplomas are often certified by foreign universities/international awarding bodies and are aligned to the national framework of qualifications at levels 6, 7 and 8.in israel, any non university higher-learning facility is called a college. institutions accredited by the council for higher education in israel  these colleges the constituent colleges of the former university of new zealand  in the context of secondary education, college is used in the names of some private schools, e.g. eton college and winchester college.in higher education, a college is normally a provider that does not hold university status, although it can also refer to a constituent part of a collegiate or federal university or a grouping of academic faculties or departments within a university. traditionally the distinction between colleges and universities was that colleges did not award degrees while universities did, but this is no longer the case with ncg having gained taught degree awarding powers  and many of the colleges of the university of london holding full degree awarding powers and being effectively universities. most colleges, however, do not hold their own degree awarding powers and continue to offer higher education courses that are validated by universities or other institutions that can award degrees.in england, as of august016, over 60% of the higher education providers directly funded by hefce  many private providers are also called colleges, e.g. the new college of the humanities and st patricks college, london.colleges within universities vary immensely in their responsibilities. the large constituent colleges of the university of london are effectively universities in their own right; colleges in some universities, including those of the university of the arts london and smaller colleges of the university of london, run their own degree courses but do not award degrees; those at the university of roehampton provide accommodation and pastoral care as well as delivering the teaching on university courses; those at oxford and cambridge deliver some teaching on university courses as well as providing accommodation and pastoral care; and those in durham, kent, lancaster and york provide accommodation and pastoral care but do not normally participate in formal teaching. the legal status of these colleges also varies widely, with university of london colleges being independent corporations and recognised bodies, oxbridge colleges, colleges of the university of the highlands and islands the uhi and the university of wales trinity saint david a university college is an independent institution with the power to award taught degrees, but which has not been granted university status. university college is a protected title that can only be used with permission, although note that university college london, university college, oxford and university college, durham are colleges within their respective universities and not university colleges  a ""college"" in the us formally denotes a constituent part of a university, but in popular usage, the word ""college"" is the generic term for any post-secondary undergraduate education. americans ""go to college"" after high school, regardless of whether the specific institution is formally a college or a university. some students choose to dual-enroll, by taking college classes while still in high school. the word and its derivatives are the standard terms used to describe the institutions and experiences associated with american post-secondary undergraduate education.students must pay for college before taking classes. some borrow the money via loans, and some students fund their educations with cash, scholarships, grants, or some combination of these payment methods. in 2011, the state or federal government subsidized $8,000 to $100,000 for each undergraduate degree. for state-owned schools  the state subsidized on average 50% of public university tuition.colleges vary in terms of size, degree, and length of stay. two-year colleges, also known as junior or community colleges, usually offer an associate degree, and four-year colleges usually offer a bachelors degree. often, these are entirely undergraduate institutions, although some have graduate school programs.four-year institutions in the u.s. that emphasize a liberal arts curriculum are known as liberal arts colleges. until the 20th century, liberal arts, law, medicine, theology, and divinity were about the only form of higher education available in the united states. these schools have traditionally emphasized instruction at the undergraduate level, although advanced research may still occur at these institutions.while there is no national standard in the united states, the term ""university"" primarily designates institutions that provide undergraduate and graduate education. a university typically has as its core and its largest internal division an undergraduate college teaching a liberal arts curriculum, also culminating in a bachelors degree. what often distinguishes a university is having, in addition, one or more graduate schools engaged in both teaching graduate classes and in research. often these would be called a school of law or school of medicine,  unlike the oxbridge colleges, but similarly to durham, these residential colleges are not autonomous legal entities nor are they typically much involved in education itself, being primarily concerned with room, board, and social life. at the university of michigan, university of california, san diego and the university of california, santa cruz, however, each of the residential colleges does teach its own core writing courses and has its own distinctive set of graduation requirements.many u.s. universities have placed increased emphasis on their residential colleges in recent years. this is exemplified by the creation of new colleges at ivy league schools such as yale university and princeton university, and efforts to strengthen the contribution of the residential colleges to student education, including through a 2016 taskforce at princeton on residential colleges.the founders of the first institutions of higher education in the united states were graduates of the university of oxford and the university of cambridge. the small institutions they founded would not have seemed to them like universities .  a movement had arisen to bring a form of more practical higher education to the masses, as ""...many politicians and educators wanted to make it possible for all young americans to receive some sort of advanced education."" the morrill act ""...made it possible for the new western states to establish colleges for the citizens."" its goal was to make higher education more easily accessible to the citizenry of the country, specifically to improve agricultural systems by providing training and scholarship in the production and sales of agricultural products, and to provide formal education in ""...agriculture, home economics, mechanical arts, and other professions that seemed practical at the time.""the act was eventually extended to allow all states that had remained with the union during the american civil war, and eventually all states, to establish such institutions. most of the colleges established under the morrill act have since become full universities, and some are among the elite of the world.selection of a four-year college as compared to a two-year junior college, even by marginal students such as those with a c+ grade average in high school and sat scores in the mid 800s, increases the probability of graduation and confers substantial economic and social benefits.the term college is mainly used by private or independent secondary schools with advanced level (upper 6th formers and also polytechnic colleges which confer diplomas only. a student can complete secondary education (international general certificate of secondary education, igcse at 16 years and proceed straight to a poly-technical college or they can proceed to advanced level (16 to 19 years and obtain a general certificate of education (gce certificate which enables them to enrol at a university, provided they have good grades.  alternatively, with lower grades the gce certificate holders will have an added advantage over their gcse counterparts if they choose to enrol at a poly-technical college.  some schools in zimbabwe choose to offer the international baccalaureate studies as an alternative to the igcse and gce.",1,0
"behavioral neuroscience, also known as biological psychology, biopsychology, or psychobiology, is the application of the principles of biology to the study of physiological, genetic, and developmental mechanisms of behavior in humans and other animals.behavioral neuroscience as a scientific discipline emerged from a variety of scientific and philosophical traditions in the 18th and 19th centuries. in philosophy, people like ren\x80\x93body problem; monism and dualism. plato and aristotle are two of several philosophers who participated in this debate. plato believed that the brain was where all mental thought and processes happened. in contrast, aristotle believed the brain served the purpose of cooling down the emotions derived from the heart. the mind-body problem was a stepping stone toward attempting to understand the connection between the mind and body.another debate arose about localization of function or functional specialization versus equipotentiality which played a significant role in the development in behavioral neuroscience. as a result of localization of function research, many famous people found within psychology have come to various different conclusions. wilder penfield was able to develop a map of the cerebral cortex through studying epileptic patients along with rassmussen. research on localization of function has led behavioral neuroscientists to a better understanding of which parts of the brain control behavior. this is best exemplified through the case study of phineas gage.the term ""psychobiology"" has been used in a variety of contexts, emphasizing the importance of biology, which is the discipline that studies organic, neural and cellular modifications in behavior, plasticity in neuroscience, and biological diseases in all aspects, in addition, biology focuses and analyzes behavior and all the subjects it is concerned about, from a scientific point of view. in this context, psychology helps as a complementary, but important discipline in the neurobiological sciences. the role of psychology in this questions is that of a social tool that backs up the main or strongest biological science.  the term ""psychobiology"" was  first used in its modern sense by knight dunlap in his book an outline of psychobiology   dunlap also was the founder and editor-in-chief of the journal psychobiology. in the announcement of that journal, dunlap writes that the journal will publish research ""...bearing on the interconnection of mental and physiological functions"", which describes the field of behavioral neuroscience even in its modern sense.in many cases, humans may serve as experimental subjects in behavioral neuroscience experiments; however, a great deal of the experimental literature in behavioral neuroscience comes from the study of non-human species, most frequently rats, mice, and monkeys. as a result, a critical assumption in behavioral neuroscience is that organisms share biological and behavioral similarities, enough to permit extrapolations across species. this allies behavioral neuroscience closely with comparative psychology, evolutionary psychology, evolutionary biology, and neurobiology. behavioral neuroscience also has paradigmatic and methodological similarities to neuropsychology, which relies heavily on the study of the behavior of humans with nervous system dysfunction  physiological psychology is a subfield of behavioral neuroscience, with an appropriately narrower definitionthe distinguishing characteristic of a behavioral neuroscience experiment is that either the independent variable of the experiment is biological, or some dependent variable is biological. in other words, the nervous system of the organism under study is permanently or temporarily altered, or some aspect of the nervous system is measured  although this method is often focused in computer science, it has begun to move towards other areas of study. for example, psychology is one of these areas. computational models allow researchers in psychology to enhance their understanding of the functions and developments in nervous systems. examples of methods include the modelling of neurons, networks and brain systems and theoretical analysis. computational methods have a wide variety of roles including clarifying experiments, hypothesis testing and generating new insights. these techniques play an increasing role in the advancement of biological psychology.different manipulations have advantages and limitations. neural tissue destroyed as a primary consequence of a surgery, electric shock or neurotoxin can confound the results so that the physical trauma masks changes in the fundamental neurophysiological processes of interest.for example, when using an electrolytic probe to create a purposeful lesion in a distinct region of the rat brain, surrounding tissue can be affected: so, a change in behavior exhibited by the experimental group post-surgery is to some degree a result of damage to surrounding neural tissue, rather than by a lesion of a distinct brain region. most genetic manipulation techniques are also considered permanent. temporary lesions can be achieved with advanced in genetic manipulations, for example, certain genes can now be switched on and off with diet. pharmacological manipulations also allow blocking of certain neurotransmitters temporarily as the function returns to its previous state after the drug has been metabolized.in general, behavioral neuroscientists study similar themes and issues as academic psychologists, though limited by the need to use nonhuman animals. as a result, the bulk of literature in behavioral neuroscience deals with mental processes and behaviors that are shared across different animal models such as:however, with increasing technical sophistication and with the development of more precise noninvasive methods that can be applied to human subjects, behavioral neuroscientists are beginning to contribute to other classical topic areas of psychology, philosophy, and linguistics, such as:behavioral neuroscience has also had a strong history of contributing to the understanding of medical disorders, including those that fall under the purview of clinical psychology and biological psychopathology  (this list omits winners who were almost exclusively neuroanatomists or neurophysiologists; i.e., those that did not measure behavioral or neurobiological variables.kavli prize in neuroscience",1,0
"quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that provides a description of the physical properties of nature at the scale of atoms and subatomic particles.:1.1 it is the foundation of all quantum physics including quantum chemistry, quantum field theory, quantum technology, and quantum information science.classical physics, the description of physics that existed before the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics, describes many aspects of nature at an ordinary quantum mechanics differs from classical physics in that energy, momentum, angular momentum, and other quantities of a bound system are restricted to discrete values :102, the overall state would be a linear combination of because the measurement device is a large object, the different states where it shows different measurement results can no longer interact with each other due to a process called decoherence. any observer after a quantum state is measured, the only relevant part of it as explained previously, the measurement process, e.g. measuring the position of an electron, can be described as consisting of an entanglement of the observed system with the measuring device, so that the overall physical state is a superposition of states, each of which consists of a state for the observed system it can be shown that under the above definition for inner product, the time evolution operator eih^t/e2/a grand unified theory even with the defining postulates of both einsteins theory of general relativity and quantum theory being indisputably supported by rigorous and repeated empirical evidence, and while they do not directly contradict each other theoretically gravity is negligible in many areas of particle physics, so that unification between general relativity and quantum mechanics is not an urgent issue in those particular applications. however, the lack of a correct theory of quantum gravity is an important issue in physical cosmology and the search by physicists for an elegant ""theory of everything""  according to steven weinberg, ""there is now in my opinion no entirely satisfactory interpretation of quantum mechanics.""the views of niels bohr, werner heisenberg and other physicists are often grouped together as the ""copenhagen interpretation"". according to these views, the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics is not a temporary feature which will eventually be replaced by a deterministic theory, but is instead a final renunciation of the classical idea of ""causality"". bohr in particular emphasized that any well-defined application of the quantum mechanical formalism must always make reference to the experimental arrangement, due to the conjugate nature of evidence obtained under different experimental situations. copenhagen-type interpretations remain popular in the 21st century.albert einstein, himself one of the founders of quantum theory, did not accept some of the more philosophical or metaphysical interpretations of quantum mechanics, such as rejection of determinism and of causality. einstein believed that underlying quantum mechanics must be a theory that thoroughly and directly expresses the rule against action at a distance; in other words, he insisted on the principle of locality. he argued that quantum mechanics was incomplete, a currently valid but not a permanently definitive theory about nature. einsteins long-running exchanges with bohr about the meaning and status of quantum mechanics are now known as the bohr and many later experiments definitively verified quantum entanglement. entanglement, as demonstrated in bell-type experiments, does not violate causality, since it does not involve transfer of information.  by the early 1980s, experiments had shown that such inequalities were indeed violated in practice0th century, driven by the need to explain phenomena that, in some cases, had been observed in earlier times. scientific inquiry into the wave nature of light began in the 17th and 18th centuries, when scientists such as robert hooke, christiaan huygens and leonhard euler proposed a wave theory of light based on experimental observations. in 1803 english polymath thomas young described the famous double-slit experiment. this experiment played a major role in the general acceptance of the wave theory of light.in 1838 michael faraday discovered cathode rays. these studies were followed by the 1859 statement of the black-body radiation problem by gustav kirchhoff, the 1877 suggestion by ludwig boltzmann that the energy states of a physical system can be discrete, and the 1900 quantum hypothesis of max planck. plancks hypothesis that energy is radiated and absorbed in discrete ""quanta""  according to planck, quantities of energy could be thought of as divided into ""elements"" whose size  in fact, he considered his quantum hypothesis a mathematical trick to get the right answer rather than a sizable discovery. however, in 1905 albert einstein interpreted plancks quantum hypothesis realistically and used it to explain the photoelectric effect, in which shining light on certain materials can eject electrons from the material. niels bohr then developed plancks ideas about radiation into a model of the hydrogen atom that successfully predicted the spectral lines of hydrogen. einstein further developed this idea to show that an electromagnetic wave such as light could also be described as a particle   in his paper ""on the quantum theory of radiation,"" einstein expanded on the interaction between energy and matter to explain the absorption and emission of energy by atoms. although overshadowed at the time by his general theory of relativity, this paper articulated the mechanism underlying the stimulated emission of radiation, which became the basis of the laser.this phase is known as the old quantum theory. never complete or self-consistent, the old quantum theory was rather a set of heuristic corrections to classical mechanics. the theory is now understood as a semi-classical approximation to modern quantum mechanics. notable results from this period include, in addition to the work of planck, einstein and bohr mentioned above, einstein and debyes work on the specific heat of solids, bohr and van leeuwens proof that classical physics cannot account for diamagnetism, and arnold sommerfelds extension of the bohr model to include relativistic effects.in the mid-1920s quantum mechanics was developed to become the standard formulation for atomic physics. in the summer of 1925, bohr and heisenberg published results that closed the old quantum theory. heisenberg, max born, and pascual jordan pioneered matrix mechanics. the following year, erwin schr6. thus, the entire field of quantum physics emerged, leading to its wider acceptance at the fifth solvay conference in 1927.by 1930 quantum mechanics had been further unified and formalized by david hilbert, paul dirac and john von neumann with greater emphasis on measurement, the statistical nature of our knowledge of reality, and philosophical speculation about the observer. it has since permeated many disciplines, including quantum chemistry, quantum electronics, quantum optics, and quantum information science. it also provides a useful framework for many features of the modern periodic table of elements, and describes the behaviors of atoms during chemical bonding and the flow of electrons in computer semiconductors, and therefore plays a crucial role in many modern technologies. while quantum mechanics was constructed to describe the world of the very small, it is also needed to explain some macroscopic phenomena such as superconductors and superfluids.its speculative modern developments include string theory and other attempts to build a quantum theory of gravity.the following titles, all by working physicists, attempt to communicate quantum theory to lay people, using a minimum of technical apparatus.more technical:on wikibooks",1,0
"trigonometry  is a branch of mathematics that studies relationships between side lengths and angles of triangles. the field emerged in the hellenistic world during the 3rd century bc from applications of geometry to astronomical studies. the greeks focused on the calculation of chords, while mathematicians in india created the earliest-known tables of values for  trigonometric ratios throughout history, trigonometry has been applied in areas such as geodesy, surveying, celestial mechanics, and navigation.trigonometry is known for its many identities, which are equations used for rewriting trigonometrical expressions to solve equations, to find a more useful expression, or to discover new relationships.sumerian astronomers studied angle measure, using a division of circles into 360 degrees. they, and later the babylonians, studied the ratios of the sides of similar triangles and discovered some properties of these ratios but did not turn that into a systematic method for finding sides and angles of triangles. the ancient nubians used a similar method.in the 3rd century bc, hellenistic mathematicians such as euclid and archimedes studied the properties of chords and inscribed angles in circles, and they proved theorems that are equivalent to modern trigonometric formulae, although they presented them geometrically rather than algebraically. in 140 bc, hipparchus  in the 2nd century ad, the greco-egyptian astronomer ptolemy  ptolemy used chord length to define his trigonometric functions, a minor difference from the sine convention we use today.  these greek and indian works were translated and expanded by medieval islamic mathematicians. by the 10th century, islamic mathematicians were using all six trigonometric functions, had tabulated their values, and were applying them to problems in spherical geometry. the persian polymath nasir al-din al-tusi has been described as the creator of trigonometry as a mathematical discipline in its own right. nas1ffwhen considered as functions of a real variable, the trigonometric ratios can be represented by an infinite series. for instance, sine and cosine have the following representations:with these definitions the trigonometric functions can be defined for complex numbers. when extended as functions of real or complex variables, the following formula holds for the complex exponential:this complex exponential function, written in terms of trigonometric functions, is particularly useful.trigonometric functions were among the earliest uses for mathematical tables. such tables were incorporated into mathematics textbooks and students were taught to look up values and how to interpolate between the values listed to get higher accuracy. slide rules had special scales for trigonometric functions.scientific calculators have buttons for calculating the main trigonometric functions  most allow a choice of angle measurement methods: degrees, radians, and sometimes gradians. most computer programming languages provide function libraries that include the trigonometric functions. the floating point unit hardware incorporated into the microprocessor chips used in most personal computers has built-in instructions for calculating trigonometric functions.in addition to the six ratios listed earlier, there are additional trigonometric functions that were historically important, though seldom used today. these include the chord , the coversine  the exsecant  predicting eclipses, and describing the orbits of the planets.in modern times, the technique of triangulation is used in astronomy to measure the distance to nearby stars, as well as in satellite navigation systems.historically, trigonometry has been used for locating latitudes and longitudes of sailing vessels, plotting courses, and calculating distances during navigation.trigonometry is still used in navigation through such means as the global positioning system and artificial intelligence for autonomous vehicles.in land surveying, trigonometry is used in the calculation of lengths, areas, and relative angles between objects.on a larger scale, trigonometry is used in geography to measure distances between landmarks.the sine and cosine functions are fundamental to the theory of periodic functions, such as those that describe sound and light waves. fourier discovered that every continuous, periodic function could be described as an infinite sum of trigonometric functions.even non-periodic functions can be represented as an integral of sines and cosines through the fourier transform. this has applications to quantum mechanics and communications, among other fields.trigonometry is useful in many physical sciences, including acoustics,  and optics. in these areas, they are used to describe sound and light waves, and to solve boundary- and transmission-related problems.other fields that use trigonometry or trigonometric functions include music theory, geodesy, audio synthesis, architecture, electronics, biology, medical imaging  chemistry, number theory  seismology, meteorology, oceanography, image compression, phonetics, economics, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, civil engineering, computer graphics, cartography, crystallography and game development.trigonometry has been noted for its many identities, that is, equations that are true for all possible inputs.identities involving only angles are known as trigonometric identities. other equations, known as triangle identities, relate both the sides and angles of a given triangle. in the following identities, a, b and c are the angles of a triangle and a, b and c are the lengths of sides of the triangle opposite the respective angles the law of sines where \x81\xa1x{\\displaystyle e^{ix}=\\cos x+i\\sin x}, produces the following analytical identities for sine, cosine, and tangent in terms of e and the imaginary unit i:other commonly used trigonometric identities include the half-angle identities, the angle sum and difference identities, and the product-to-sum identities.",1,0
"an artist is a person engaged in an activity related to creating art, practicing the arts, or demonstrating an art. the common usage in both everyday speech and academic discourse refers to a practitioner in the visual arts only. however, the term is also often used in the entertainment business, especially in a business context, for musicians and other performers became the source of the english words technique, technology, technical.in greek culture each of the nine muses oversaw a different field of human creation:no muse was identified with the visual arts of painting and sculpture. in ancient greece sculptors and painters were held in low regard, somewhere between freemen and slaves, their work regarded as mere manual labour.the word art derives from the latin ""ars"" with the academies in europe the english word artiste has thus a narrower range of meaning than the word artiste in french.in living with art, mark getlein proposes six activities, services or functions of contemporary artists:after looking at years of data on arts school graduates as well as policies & program outcomes regarding artists, arts, & culture, elizabeth lingo and steven tepper propose the divide between ""arts for arts sake"" artists and commercially successful artists is not as wide as may be perceived, and that ""this bifurcation between the commercial and the noncommercial, the excellent and the base, the elite and the popular, is increasingly breaking down"" the us bureau of labor statistics classifies many visual artists as either craft artists or fine artists.  a craft artist makes handmade functional works of art, such as pottery or clothing.  a fine artist makes paintings, illustrations   many fine artists have studied their art form at university and some have a masters degree in fine arts.  artists may also study on their own or receive on-the-job training from an experienced artist.the number of available jobs as an artist is increasing more slowly than other fields.  about half of us artists are self-employed.  others work in a variety of industries.  for example, a pottery manufacturer will employ craft artists, and book publishers will hire illustrators.in the us, fine artists have a median income of approximately us$50,000 per year, and craft artists have a median income of approximately us$33,000 per year.  this compares to us$61,000 for all art-related fields, including related jobs such as graphic designers, multimedia artists, animators, and fashion designers.  many artists work part-time as artists and hold a second job.",1,0
"professional development is learning to earn or maintain professional credentials such as academic degrees to formal coursework, attending conferences, and informal learning opportunities situated in practice. it has been described as intensive and collaborative, ideally incorporating an evaluative stage. there is a variety of approaches to professional development, including consultation, coaching, communities of practice, lesson study, mentoring, reflective supervision and technical assistance.the university of management and technology notes the use of the phrase ""professional development"" from 1857 onwards.in the training of school staff in the united states, ""he need for professional development ... came to the forefront in the 1960s"".a wide variety of people, such as teachers, military officers and non-commissioned officers, health care professionals, lawyers, accountants and engineers engage in professional development. individuals may participate in professional development because of an interest in lifelong learning, a sense of moral obligation, to maintain and improve professional competence, to enhance career progression, to keep abreast of new technology and practices, or to comply with professional regulatory requirements. many american states have professional development requirements for school teachers. for example, arkansas teachers must complete 60 hours of documented professional development activities annually. professional development credits are named differently from state to state. for example, teachers in indiana are required to earn 90 continuing renewal units  in massachusetts, teachers need 150 professional development points  and in georgia, teachers must earn 10 professional learning units  american and canadian nurses, as well as those in the united kingdom, have to participate in formal and informal professional development a professional school is a graduate school level institution that prepares students for careers in specific fields. some of the schools also offer undergraduate degrees in specific professions. examples of this type of school include:architecture school, business school, divinity school, engineering school, journalism school, law school, library school, schools of education professional development opportunities can range from a single workshop to a semester-long academic course, to services offered by a medley of different professional development providers and varying widely with respect to the philosophy, content, and format of the learning experiences.  some examples of approaches to professional development include:the world banks 2019 world development report on the future of work  argues that professional development opportunities for those both in and out of work, such as flexible learning opportunities at universities and adult learning programs, enable labor markets to adjust to the future of work.initial professional development  professional associations may recognise the successful completion of ipd by the award of chartered or similar status. examples of professional bodies that require ipd prior to the award of professional status are the institute of mathematics and its applications, the institution of structural engineers, and the institution of occupational safety and health.continuing professional development  american academy of financial management, safety professionals with the international institute of risk & safety management  or the institution of occupational safety and health  and medical and legal professionals, who are subject to continuing medical education or continuing legal education requirements, which vary by jurisdiction.a systematic review published in 2019 by the campbell collaboration found little evidence of the effectiveness of continuing professional development ",1,0
"golf is a club-and-ball sport in which players use various clubs to hit balls into a series of holes on a course in as few strokes as possible.golf, unlike most ball games, cannot and does not utilize a standardized playing area, and coping with the varied terrains encountered on different courses is a key part of the game. the game at the usual level is played on a course with an arranged progression of 18 holes, though recreational courses can be smaller, often having nine holes. each hole on the course must contain a teeing ground to start from, and a putting green containing the actual hole or cup 4 when he became a golfer himself, with golf clubs first recorded in 15032 to 18 holes. golf is documented as being played on musselburgh links, east lothian, scotland as early as 2 march 1672, which is certified as the oldest golf course in the world by guinness world records. the oldest surviving rules of golf were compiled in march 1744 for the company of gentlemen golfers, later renamed the honourable company of edinburgh golfers, which was played at leith, scotland. the worlds oldest golf tournament in existence, and golfs first major, is the open championship, which was first played on 17 october 1860 at prestwick golf club, in ayrshire, scotland, with scottish golfers winning the earliest majors. two scotsmen from dunfermline, john reid and robert lockhart, first demonstrated golf in the u.s. by setting up a hole in an orchard in 1888, with reid setting up americas first golf club the same year, saint andrews golf club in yonkers, new york.a golf course consists of either 9 or 18 holes, each with a teeing ground that is set off by two markers showing the bounds of the legal tee area, fairway, rough and other hazards, and the putting green surrounded by the fringe with the pin early scottish golf courses were primarily laid out on links land, soil-covered sand dunes directly inland from beaches. this gave rise to the term ""golf links"", particularly applied to seaside courses and those built on naturally sandy soil inland.the first 18-hole golf course in the united states was on a sheep farm in downers grove, illinois, in 1892. the course is still there today.every round of golf is based on playing a number of holes in a given order. a ""round"" typically consists of 18 holes that are played in the order determined by the course layout. each hole is played once in the round on a standard course of 18 holes. the game can be played by any number of people, although a typical group playing will have 1-4 people playing the round. the typical amount of time required for pace of play for a 9-hole round is two hours and four hours for an 18-hole round.playing a hole on a golf course is initiated by putting a ball into play by striking it with a club on the teeing ground in stroke play competitions played according to strict rules, each player plays his or her ball until it is holed no matter how many strokes that may take. in match play it is acceptable to simply pick up ones ball and ""surrender the hole"" after enough strokes have been made by a player that it is mathematically impossible for the player to win the hole. it is also acceptable in informal stroke play to surrender the hole after hitting three strokes more than the ""par"" rating of the hole  a caddies advice can only be given to the player or players for whom the caddie is working, and not to other competing players.the rules of golf are internationally standardised and are jointly governed by the r&a, spun off in 2004 from the royal and ancient golf club of st andrews  with the aim of simplifying the rules, in 2017 the usga and r&a undertook a complete rewrite. the new rule book came into effect in january 2019.the underlying principle of the rules is fairness. as stated on the back cover of the official rule book:there are strict regulations regarding the amateur status of golfers. essentially, anybody who has ever received payment or compensation for giving instruction, or played golf for money, is not considered an amateur and may not participate in competitions limited solely to amateurs. however, amateur golfers may receive expenses that comply with strict guidelines and they may accept non-cash prizes within the limits established by the rules of amateur status.in addition to the officially printed rules, golfers also abide by a set of guidelines called golf etiquette. etiquette guidelines cover matters such as safety, fairness, pace of play, and a players obligation to contribute to the care of the course. though there are no penalties for breach of etiquette rules, players generally follow the rules of golf etiquette in an effort to improve everyones playing experience.penalty strokes are incurred in certain situations and are counted towards a players score as if there were extra swing the combination of a soft ""boundary layer"" and a hard ""core"" enables both distance and spin.a tee is allowed only for the first stroke on each hole, unless the player must hit a provisional tee shot or replay his or her first shot from the tee.many golfers wear golf shoes with metal or plastic spikes designed to increase traction, thus allowing for longer and more accurate shots.a golf bag is used to transport golf clubs and the players other or personal equipment. golf bags have several pockets designed for carrying equipment and supplies such as tees, balls, and gloves. golf bags can be carried, pulled on a trolley or harnessed to a motorized golf cart during play. golf bags usually have both a hand strap and shoulder strap for carrying, others may be carried over both shoulders like a backpack, and often bags have retractable legs that allow the bag to stand upright when at rest.the golf swing is outwardly similar to many other motions involving swinging a tool or playing implement, such as an axe or a baseball bat. however, unlike many of these motions, the result of the swing is highly dependent on several sub-motions being properly aligned and timed. these ensure that the club travels up to the ball in line with the desired path; that the clubface is in line with the swing path; and that the ball hits the centre or ""sweet spot"" of the clubface. the ability to do this consistently, across a complete set of clubs with a wide range of shaft lengths and clubface areas, is a key skill for any golfer, and takes a significant effort to achieve.stance refers to how the golfer positions themselves in order to play a stroke; it is fundamentally important in being able to play a stroke effectively. the stance adopted is determined by what stroke is being played. all stances involve a slight crouch. this allows for a more efficient striking posture whilst also isometrically preloading the muscles of the legs and core; this allows the stroke to be played more dynamically and with a greater level of overall control. when adopting their stance golfers start with the non-dominant side of the body facing the target putting is considered to be the most important component of the game of golf. as the game of golf has evolved, there have been many different putting techniques and grips that have been devised to give golfers the best chance to make putts. when the game originated, golfers would putt with their dominant hand on the bottom of the grip and their weak hand on top of the grip. this grip and putting style is known as ""conventional"". there are many variations of conventional including overlap, where the golfer overlaps the off hand index finger onto off the dominant pinky; interlock, where the offhand index finger interlocks with the dominant pinky and ring finger; double or triple overlap and so on. recently, ""cross handed"" putting has become a popular trend amongst professional golfers and amateurs. cross handed putting is the idea that the dominant hand is on top of the grip where the weak hand is on the bottom. this grip restricts the motion in your dominant hand and eliminates the possibility of wrist breakdowns through the putting stroke.other notable putting styles include ""the claw"", a style that has the grip directly in between the thumb and index finger of the dominant hand while the palm faces the target. the weak hand placed normally on the putter. anchored putting, a style that requires a longer putter shaft that can be anchored into the players stomach or below the chin; the idea is to stabilize one end of the putter thus creating a more consistent pendulum stroke. this style has been banned on professional circuits since 2016.a hole is classified by its par, which gives an indication of the number of strokes a skilled golfer may be expected to need to complete play of the hole. the primary factor for classifying the par of a relatively straight, hazard-free hole is the distance from the tee to the green, and calculates the number of strokes a skilled golfer is expected to require to reach the green with an additional allowance of 2 putts. as such, the minimum par of any hole is 3; one stroke for the tee shot and two putts. par 3, 4 and 5 holes are commonplace on golf courses; far more rarely, courses may feature par-6 and even par-7 holes.for men, a typical par-3 hole is less than 250 yards getting the ball onto the green in two strokes less than par, and hence meeting the par calculation criteria, is called making ""green in regulation"" or gir. missing a gir does not necessarily mean a golfer will not make par, but it does make doing so more difficult as it reduces the number of putts available; conversely, making a gir does not guarantee a par, as the player might require three or more putts to ""hole out"". professional golfers typically make between 60% and 70% of greens in regulation.eighteen-hole courses typically total to an overall par score of 70 to 72 for a complete round; with most holes having a par of 4, and a smaller number of par-3 and par-5 holes. additionally, courses may be classified according to their play difficulty, which may be used to calculate a golfers handicap. the two primary difficulty ratings in the u.s. are the course rating, which is the expected score for a zero-handicap ""scratch golfer"", and the slope rating, which is a measure of how much worse a ""bogey golfer"" in a typical professional tournament or among ""scratch"" amateur players, ""birdie-bogey"" play is common; a player will ""lose"" a stroke by bogeying a hole, then ""gain"" one by scoring a birdie. eagles are uncommon but not rare; however, only 18 players have scored an albatross in a mens major championship. one of the rarest feats in golf is the condor, which has never occurred in a professional tournament. only four condors have been verified to have ever occurred: all of them involved hitting a hole in one on a par-5 hole, although none of the courses involved were professionally accredited.there are two basic forms of golf play, match play and stroke play. stroke play is more popular.two players the score achieved for each and every hole of the round or tournament is added to produce the total score, and the player with the lowest score wins in stroke play. stroke play is the game most commonly played by professional golfers. if there is a tie after the regulation number of holes in a professional tournament, a playoff takes place between all tied players. playoffs either are sudden death or employ a pre-determined number of holes, anywhere from three to a full 18. in sudden death, a player who scores lower on a hole than all of his opponents wins the match. if at least two players remain tied after such a playoff using a pre-determined number of holes, then play continues in sudden death format, where the first player to win a hole wins the tournament.there are many variations in scoring and playing formats in the game of golf, some officially defined in the rules of golf. variations include the popular stableford scoring system, and various team formats. some common and popular examples are listed below.there are also variations on the usual starting procedure where everyone begins from the first tee and plays all holes in order, though to the eighteenth. in large field tournaments, especially on professional tours, a two tee start is commonplace, where the field will be split between starting on the first tee and the tenth tee a handicap is a numerical measure of a golfers potential scoring ability over 18 holes. it is used to enable players of widely varying abilities to compete against one another. better players are those with the lowest handicaps, and someone with a handicap of 0 or less is often referred to as a scratch golfer. handicap systems vary throughout the world and use different methods to assess courses and calculate handicaps. in order to address difficulties in translating between these systems the usga and the r&a, working with the various existing handicapping authorities, devised a new world handicap system which is set to be introduced globally starting in 2020.golf courses are assessed and rated according to the average good score of a scratch golfer, taking into account a multitude of factors affecting play, such as length, obstacles, undulations, etc. a players handicap gives an indication of the number of strokes above this course rating that the player will make over the course of an ""average best"" round of golf, i.e. scoring near their potential, above average. lower handicap players are generally the most consistent, so can be expected to play to this standard or better more often than higher handicappers. some handicap systems also account for differences in scoring difficulty between low and high handicap golfer. they do this by means of assessing and rating courses according to the average good score of a ""bogey golfer"", a player with a handicap of around 20. this is used with the course rating to calculate a slope rating, which is used to adjust golfers handicap to produce a playing handicap for the course and set of tees being used.handicap systems have potential for abuse by players who may intentionally play badly to increase their handicap in the united states, the number of people who play golf twenty-five times or more per year decreased from 6.9000 to 4.6005, according to the national golf foundation. the ngf reported that the number who played golf at all decreased from 30 to 2600 yards number of golf courses by country in 2015. below are the top 18 countries that have the most golf courses.the majority of professional golfers work as club or teaching professionals the fields for these events include the top several dozen golfers from all over the world. the masters has been played at augusta national golf club in augusta, georgia, since its inception in 1934. it is the only major championship that is played at the same course each year. the u.s. open and pga championship are played at courses around the united states, while the open championship is played at courses around the united kingdom.prior to the advent of the pga championship and the masters, the four majors were the u.s. open, the u.s. amateur, the open championship, and the british amateur.womens golf does not have a globally agreed set of majors. the list of majors recognised by the dominant womens tour, the lpga tour in the u.s., has changed several times over the years, with the most recent changes occurring in 2001 and 2013. like the pga tour, the  tour long had four majors, but now has five: the ana inspiration  the u.s. womens open, the womens british open   41 different countries were represented by 120 athletes.it was not until 1552 that the first woman golfer played the game. mary queen of scots commissioned st. andrews links. however, it was not until the 20th century that women were taken seriously and eventually broke the ""gentlemen only, ladies forbidden"" rule. many men saw women as unfit to play the sport due to their lack of strength and ability.in the united states, 1891 was a pivotal year for ladies golf because the shinnecock hills nine-hole course was built in southampton, new york, for women and was the first club to offer membership to women golfers. four years later, in 1895, the u.s. golf association held the first womens amateur championship tournament.just like professional golfer bobby jones, joyce wethered was considered to be a star in the 1920s. jones praised wethered in 1930 after they had played an exhibition against each other. he doubted that there had ever been a better golfer, man or woman. however, bobby jones comment was not enough for others to change their views on women golfers.the royal liverpools club refused entry of sir henry cottons wife into the clubhouse in the late 1940s. the secretary of the club released a statement saying, ""no woman ever has entered the clubhouse and, praise god, no woman ever will."" however, american golfer and all-around athlete babe zaharias did not have to enter the clubhouse. she was able to prove herself on the course, going on to become the first american to win the british womens amateur title in 1947. the following year she became the first woman to attempt to qualify for the u.s. open, but her application was rejected by the usga. they stated that the event was intended to be open to men only.the ladies professional golf association was formed in 1950 as a way to popularize the sport and provide competitive opportunities for golfers. the competitions were not the same for the men and women. it was not until 1972 that u.s. congress passed the title ix of the education amendments. ""no person in the united states shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subject to discrimination under any education program or activities receiving federal financial assistance."" american renee powell moved to the uk in the 1970s to further her career, and became the first woman to play in a british mens tournament in 1977.today, women golfers are still fighting to have the same opportunities as men golfers. there is still a big pay gap in the usga. the usga has a long history of writing bigger checks to winners of the mens u.s. open than the u.s. womens open.",1,0
"anime  the earliest commercial japanese animations date to 1917. a characteristic art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of cartoonist osamu tezuka and spread in following decades, developing a large domestic audience. anime is distributed theatrically, through television broadcasts, directly to home media, and over the internet. in addition to original works, anime are often adaptations of japanese comics  compared to western animation, anime production generally focuses less on movement, and more on the detail of settings and use of ""camera effects"", such as panning, zooming, and angle shots. diverse art styles are used, and character proportions and features can be quite varied.the anime industry consists of over 430 production companies, including major studios like studio ghibli, gainax, and toei animation. since the 1980s, the medium has also seen international success with the rise of foreign dubbed and subtitled programming. as of 2016, japanese anime accounted for 60% of the worlds animated television shows.as a type of animation, anime is an art form that comprises many genres found in other mediums; it is sometimes mistakenly classified as a genre itself. in japanese, the term anime is used to refer to all animated works, regardless of style or origin. english-language dictionaries typically define anime  as ""a style of japanese animation"" or as ""a style of animation originating in japan"". other definitions are based on origin, making production in japan a requisite for a work to be considered ""anime"".the etymology of the term anime is disputed. the english word ""animation"" is written in japanese katakana as 0th century, when filmmakers started to experiment with techniques pioneered in france, germany, the united states, and russia. a claim for the earliest japanese animation is katsud3 great kant000s, an increased number of anime works have been adaptations of light novels and visual novels; successful examples include the melancholy of haruhi suzumiya and fate/stay night  while no single art style predominates anime as a whole, they do share some similar attributes in terms of animation technique and character design.modern anime follows a typical animation production process, involving storyboarding, voice acting, character design, and cel production. since the 1990s, animators have increasingly used computer animation to improve the efficiency of the production process. early anime works were experimental, and consisted of images drawn on blackboards, stop motion animation of paper cutouts, and silhouette animation. cel animation grew in popularity until it came to dominate the medium. in the 21st century, the use of other animation techniques is mostly limited to independent short films, including the stop motion puppet animation work produced by tadahito mochinaga, kihachir8-go. a major subgenre of science fiction is mecha, with the gundam metaseries being iconic. the diverse fantasy genre includes works based on asian and western traditions and folklore; examples include the japanese feudal fairytale inuyasha, and the depiction of scandinavian goddesses who move to japan to maintain a computer called yggdrasil in ah! my goddess. genre crossing in anime is also prevalent, such as the blend of fantasy and comedy in dragon half, and the incorporation of slapstick humor in the crime anime film castle of cagliostro. other subgenres found in anime include magical girl, harem, sports, martial arts, literary adaptations, medievalism, and war.early anime works were made for theatrical viewing, and required played musical components before sound and vocal components were added to the production. in 1958, nippon television aired mogura no abanch001, animation accounted for 7% of the japanese film market, above the 4.6% market share for live-action works. the popularity and success of anime is seen through the profitability of the dvd market, contributing nearly 70% of total sales. according to a 2016 article on nikkei asian review, japanese television stations have bought over 0 billion from overseas. there has been a rise in sales of shows to television stations in japan, caused by late night anime with adults as the target demographic. this type of anime is less popular outside japan, being considered ""more of a niche product"". spirited away  it was also the highest-grossing anime film worldwide until it was overtaken by makoto shinkais 2016 film your name. anime films represent a large part of the highest-grossing japanese films yearly in japan, with 6 out of the top 10 in 2014, in 2015 and also in 2016.anime has to be licensed by companies in other countries in order to be legally released. while anime has been licensed by its japanese owners for use outside japan since at least the 1960s, the practice became well-established in the united states in the late 1970s to early 1980s, when such tv series as gatchaman and captain harlock were licensed from their japanese parent companies for distribution in the us market. the trend towards american distribution of anime continued into the 1980s with the licensing of titles such as voltron and the creation of new series such as robotech through use of source material from several original series.in the early 1990s, several companies began to experiment with the licensing of less children-oriented material. some, such as a.d. vision, and central park media and its imprints, achieved fairly substantial commercial success and went on to become major players in the now very lucrative american anime market. others, such as animeigo, achieved limited success. many companies created directly by japanese parent companies did not do as well, most releasing only one or two titles before completing their american operations.licenses are expensive, often hundreds of thousands of dollars for one series and tens of thousands for one movie. the prices vary widely; for example, jinki: extend cost only $91,000 to license while kurau phantom memory cost $960,000. simulcast internet streaming rights can be cheaper, with prices around $1,000-$2,000 an episode, but can also be more expensive, with some series costing more than us$200,000 per episode.the anime market for the united states was worth approximately $2.74009. dubbed animation began airing in the united states in 2000 on networks like the wb and cartoon networks adult swim. in 2005, this resulted in five of the top ten anime titles having previously aired on cartoon network. as a part of localization, some editing of cultural references may occur to better follow the references of the non-japanese culture. the cost of english localization averages us$10,000 per episode.the industry has been subject to both praise and condemnation for fansubs, the addition of unlicensed and unauthorized subtitled translations of anime series or films. fansubs, which were originally distributed on vhs bootlegged cassettes in the 1980s, have been freely available and disseminated online since the 1990s. since this practice raises concerns for copyright and piracy issues, fansubbers tend to adhere to an unwritten moral code to destroy or no longer distribute an anime once an official translated or subtitled version becomes licensed. they also try to encourage viewers to buy an official copy of the release once it comes out in english, although fansubs typically continue to circulate through file-sharing networks. even so, the laid back regulations of the japanese animation industry tend to overlook these issues, allowing it to grow underground and thus increasing the popularity until there is a demand for official high-quality releases for animation companies. this has led to an increase in global popularity with japanese animations, reaching $40004.legal international availability of anime on the internet has changed in recent years, with simulcasts of series available on websites like crunchyroll. however, such services are still mostly limited to the western, english-speaking countries, resulting in many fans in the developing world turning to online piracy.japan external trade organization  jetro reported sales of overseas anime exports in 2004 to be  trillion  jetro valued the anime market in the united states at 0 billion  including $500 million in home video sales and over $4 billion from licensed products, in 2005. jetro projected in 2005 that the worldwide anime market, including sales of licensed products, would grow to 1 billion in 2017, and is projected to reach $31 billion by 2020. as of 2018, the anime industry is estimated to generate over $300 billion in global revenue.the anime industry has several annual awards that honor the years best works. major annual awards in japan include the 006. anime productions have also been nominated and won awards not exclusively for anime, like the academy award for best animated feature or the golden bear.anime has become commercially profitable in western countries, as demonstrated by early commercially successful western adaptations of anime, such as astro boy and speed racer. early american adaptions in the 1960s made japan expand into the continental european market, first with productions aimed at european and japanese children, such as heidi, vicky the viking and barbapapa, which aired in various countries. particularly italy, spain and france grew an interest into japans output, due to its cheap selling price and productive output. in fact, italy imported the most anime outside of japan. these mass imports influenced anime popularity in south american, arabic and german markets.the beginning of 1980 saw the introduction of japanese anime series into the american culture. in the 1990s, japanese animation slowly gained popularity in america. media companies such as viz and mixx began publishing and releasing animation into the american market. the 1988 film akira is largely credited with popularizing anime in the western world during the early 1990s, before anime was further popularized by television shows such as pok020 anime fans in many non-western countries, such as india or southeast asia, have difficulty obtaining access to legal content, and therefore still turn to online piracy.anime clubs gave rise to anime conventions in the 1990s with the ""anime boom"", a period marked by increased popularity of anime. these conventions are dedicated to anime and manga and include elements like cosplay contests and industry talk panels. cosplay, a portmanteau for ""costume play"", is not unique to anime and has become popular in contests and masquerades at anime conventions. japanese culture and words have entered english usage through the popularity of the medium, including otaku, an unflattering japanese term commonly used in english to denote a fan of anime and manga. another word that has arisen describing fans in the united states is wapanese meaning white individuals who want to be japanese, or later known as weeaboo, individuals who demonstrate an obsession in japanese anime subculture, a term that originated from abusive content posted on the popular bulletin board website 4chan.org. anime enthusiasts have produced fan fiction and fan art, including computer wallpapers and anime music videos.as of the 2010s, many anime fans use online communities and databases such as myanimelist to discuss anime and track their progress watching respective series.one of the key points that made anime different from a handful of western cartoons is the potential for visceral content. once the expectation that the aspects of visual intrigue or animation being just for children is put aside, the audience can realize that themes involving violence, suffering, sexuality, pain, and death can all be storytelling elements utilized in anime as much as other types of media. however, as anime itself became increasingly popular, its styling has been inevitably the subject of both satire and serious creative productions. south parks ""chinpokomon"" and ""good times with weapons"" episodes, adult swims perfect hair forever, and nickelodeons kappa mikey are western examples of satirical depictions of japanese culture and anime, but anime tropes have also been satirized by some anime, such as konosuba.traditionally only japanese works have been considered anime, but some works have sparked debate for blurring the lines between anime and cartoons, such as the american anime style production avatar: the last airbender. these anime styled works have become defined as anime-influenced animation, in an attempt to classify all anime styled works of non-japanese origin. some creators of these works cite anime as a source of inspiration, for example the french production team for 013, monty oum, the creator of rwby, said ""some believe just like scotch needs to be made in scotland, an american company cant make anime. i think thats a narrow way of seeing it. anime is an art form, and to say only one country can make this art is wrong."" rwby has been released in japan with a japanese language dub; the ceo of rooster teeth, matt hullum, commented ""this is the first time any american-made anime has been marketed to japan. it definitely usually works the other way around, and were really pleased about that.""in japanese culture and entertainment, media mix is a strategy to disperse content across multiple representations: different broadcast media, gaming technologies, cell phones, toys, amusement parks, and other methods. it is the japanese term for a transmedia franchise. the term gained its circulation in late 1980s, but the origins of the strategy can be traced back to the 1960s with the proliferation of anime, with its interconnection of media and commodity goods.a number of anime media franchises have gained considerable global popularity, and are among the worlds highest-grossing media franchises. pok\xc3\xa9mon in particular is the highest-grossing media franchise of all time, bigger than star wars and marvel cinematic universe.",1,0
"a lighthouse is a tower, building, or another type of structure designed to emit light from a system of lamps and lenses and to serve as a navigational aid for maritime pilots at sea or on inland waterways.lighthouses mark dangerous coastlines, hazardous shoals, reefs, rocks, and safe entries to harbors; they also assist in aerial navigation.  once widely used, the number of operational lighthouses has declined due to the expense of maintenance and has become uneconomical since the advent of cheaper and often much more effective electronic navigational systems.before the development of clearly defined ports, mariners were guided by fires built on hilltops. since elevating the fire would improve the visibility, placing the fire on a platform became a practice that led to the development of the lighthouse. in antiquity, the lighthouse functioned more as an entrance marker to ports than as a warning signal for reefs and promontories, unlike many modern lighthouses. the most famous lighthouse structure from antiquity was the pharos of alexandria, egypt, which collapsed following a series of earthquakes between 956 ce and 1323 ce.the intact tower of hercules at a coru iron stanchions secured in the rock, and was built by henry winstanley from 1696 to 1698. his lighthouse was the first tower in the world to have been fully exposed to the open sea.the civil engineer, john smeaton, rebuilt the lighthouse from 1756 the source of illumination had generally been wood pyres or burning coal. the argand lamp, invented in 1782 by the swiss scientist aim3 in the cordouan lighthouse at the mouth of the gironde estuary; its light could be seen from more than 20 miles  fresnels invention increased the luminosity of the lighthouse lamp by a factor of four and his system is still in common use.the advent of electrification, and automatic lamp changers began to make lighthouse keepers obsolete. for many years, lighthouses still had keepers, partly because lighthouse-keepers could serve as a rescue service if necessary. improvements in maritime navigation and safety such as satellite navigation systems such as gps led to the phasing out of non-automated lighthouses across the world. in canada, this trend has been stopped and there are still 50 staffed light stations, with 27 on the west coast alone.remaining modern lighthouses are usually illuminated by a single stationary flashing light powered by solar-charged batteries mounted on a steel skeleton tower. where the power requirement is too great for solar power, cycle charging by diesel generator is used: to save fuel and to increase periods between maintenance the light is battery powered, with the generator only coming into use when the battery has to be charged.john smeaton is noteworthy for having designed the third and most famous eddystone lighthouse, but some builders are well known for their work in building multiple lighthouses. the stevenson family united states army corps of engineers lieutenant george meade built numerous lighthouses along the atlantic and gulf coasts before gaining wider fame as the winning general at the battle of gettysburg.  colonel orlando m. poe, engineer to general william tecumseh sherman in the siege of atlanta, designed and built some of the most exotic lighthouses in the most difficult locations on the u.s. great lakes.french merchant navy officer marius michel pasha built almost a hundred lighthouses along the coasts of the ottoman empire in a period of twenty years after the crimean war in a lighthouse, the source of light is called the ""lamp""  carbide was promoted by the dal020 led lights, using less energy and easier to maintain, had come into widespread use. in the united kingdom and ireland about a third of lighthouses had been converted from filament light sources to use leds, and conversion continued with about three per year. the light sources are designed to replicate the colour and character of the traditional light as closely as possible. the change is often not noticed by people in the region, but sometimes a proposed change leads to calls to preserve the traditional light, including in some cases a rotating beam. a typical led system designed to fit into the traditional 19th century fresnel lens enclosure was developed by trinity house and two other lighthouse authorities and costs about 0,000, depending on configuration, according to a supplier; it has large fins to dissipate heat. lifetime of the led light source is 50,000 to 100,000 hours, compared to about 1,000 hours for a filament source.experimental installations of laser lights, either at high power to provide a ""line of light"" in the sky or, utilising low power, aimed towards mariners have identified problems of increased complexity in installation and maintenance, and high power requirements. the first practical installation, in 1971 at point danger lighthouse, queensland, was replaced by a conventional light after four years because the beam was too narrow to be seen easily.in any of these designs an observer, rather than seeing a continuous weak light, sees a brighter light during short time intervals. these instants of bright light are arranged to create a light characteristic or pattern specific to a lighthouse. for example, the scheveningen lighthouse flashes are alternately 2.5 and 7.50th century. these often have a narrow cylindrical core surrounded by an open lattice work bracing, such as finns point range light.sometimes a lighthouse needs to be constructed in the water itself.  wave-washed lighthouses are masonry structures constructed to withstand water impact, such as eddystone lighthouse in britain and the st. george reef light of california.  in shallower bays, screw-pile lighthouse ironwork structures are screwed into the seabed and a low wooden structure is placed above the open framework, such as thomas point shoal lighthouse. as screw piles can be disrupted by ice, steel caisson lighthouses such as orient point light are used in cold climates.  orient long beach bar light in waters too deep for a conventional structure, a lightship might be used instead of a lighthouse, such as the former lightship columbia.  most of these have now been replaced by fixed light platforms aligning two fixed points on land provides a navigator with a line of position called a range in north america and a transit in britain. ranges can be used to precisely align a vessel within a narrow channel such as a river. with landmarks of a range illuminated with a set of fixed lighthouses, nighttime navigation is possible.such paired lighthouses are called range lights in north america and leading lights in the united kingdom. the closer light is referred to as the beacon or front range; the further light is called the rear range. the rear range light is almost always taller than the front.when a vessel is on the correct course, the two lights align vertically, but when the observer is out of position, the difference in alignment indicates the direction of travel to correct the course.there are two types of lighthouses: ones that are located on land, and ones that are offshore. a land lighthouse is simply a lighthouse constructed to aid navigation over land, rather than water. historically, they were constructed in areas of flatland where the featureless landscape and prevailing weather conditions  there can be a number of reasons for these lighthouses to be built.  there can be a shoal, reef or submerged island several miles from land.the current cordouan lighthouse was completed in 1611 7 kilometres in the united states, lighthouses are maintained by the united states coast guard the united kingdom and eire together have three bodies: lighthouses around the coasts of england and wales are looked after by trinity house, those around scotland and the isle of man by the northern lighthouse board and those around ireland by the commissioners of irish lights. in canada, they are managed by the canadian coast guard. in australia, lighthouses are conducted by the australian maritime safety authority.the soviet union built a number of automated lighthouses powered by radioisotope thermoelectric generators in remote locations. they operated for long periods without external support with great reliability. however numerous installations deteriorated, were stolen, or vandalized. some cannot be found due to poor record keeping.in india, lighthouses are maintained by directorate general of lighthouses and lightships which comes under the ministry of shipping.as lighthouses became less essential to navigation, many of their historic structures faced demolition or neglect. in the united states, the national historic lighthouse preservation act of 2000 provides for the transfer of lighthouse structures to local governments and private non-profit groups, while the uscg continues to maintain the lamps and lenses. in canada, the nova scotia lighthouse preservation society won heritage status for sambro island lighthouse, and sponsored the heritage lighthouse protection act to change canadian federal laws to protect lighthouses.many groups formed to restore and save lighthouses around the world. they include the world lighthouse society and the united states lighthouse society. a further international group is the amateur radio lighthouse society, which sends amateur radio operators to publicize the preservation of remote lighthouses throughout the world.lighthouses were once regarded as an archetypal public good, because ships could benefit from the light without being forced to pay.",1,0
"the tang dynasty  ; chinese: 6, when he was forcefully deposed by his son li shimin, the prince of qin.  li shimin had commanded troops since the age of 18 years old, had prowess with bow and arrow, sword and lance and was known for his effective cavalry charges.  fighting a numerically superior army, he defeated dou jiande   in a violent elimination of royal family due to fear of assassination, li shimin ambushed and killed two of his brothers, li yuanji   shortly thereafter, his father abdicated in his favor and li shimin ascended the throne.  he is conventionally known by his temple name taizong.although killing two brothers and deposing his father contradicted the confucian value of filial piety, taizong showed himself to be a capable leader who listened to the advice of the wisest members of his council.  in 628, emperor taizong held a buddhist memorial service for the casualties of war, and in 629 he had buddhist monasteries erected at the sites of major battles so that monks could pray for the fallen on both sides of the fight.during the tang campaign against the eastern turks, the eastern turkic khaganate was destroyed after the capture of its ruler, illig qaghan by the famed tang military officer li jing  taizong was succeeded by his son li zhi   emperor gaozong suffered a stroke in 655, and wu began to make many of his court decisions for him, discussing affairs of state with his councilors, who took orders from her while she sat behind a screen.  when empress wus eldest son, the crown prince, began to assert his authority and advocate policies opposed by empress wu, he suddenly died in 675.  many suspected he was poisoned by empress wu.  although the next heir apparent kept a lower profile, in 680 he was accused by wu of plotting a rebellion and was banished.  in 683, emperor gaozong died. he was succeeded by emperor zhongzong, his eldest surviving son by wu.  zhongzong tried to appoint his wifes father as chancellor: after only six weeks on the throne, he was deposed by empress wu in favor of his younger brother, emperor ruizong.  this provoked a group of tang princes to rebel in 684.  wus armies suppressed them within two months.  she proclaimed the tianshou era of wu zhou on october 16, 690, and three days later demoted emperor ruizong to crown prince.  he was also forced to give up his fathers surname li in favor of the empress wu.  she then ruled as chinas only empress regnant.a palace coup on february 20, 705, forced empress wu to yield her position on february 22.  the next day, her son zhongzong was restored to power; the tang was formally restored on march 3. she died soon after.  to legitimize her rule, she circulated a document known as the great cloud sutra, which predicted that a reincarnation of the maitreya buddha would be a female monarch who would dispel illness, worry, and disaster from the world.  she even introduced numerous revised written characters to the written language, which reverted to the originals after her death.  arguably the most important part of her legacy was diminishing the hegemony of the northwestern aristocracy, allowing people from other clans and regions of china to become more represented in chinese politics and government.there were many prominent women at court during and after wus reign, including shangguan waner  in 706 the wife of emperor zhongzong of tang, empress wei  empress wei eventually poisoned zhongzong, whereupon she placed his fifteen-year-old son upon the throne in 710. two weeks later, li longji  just as emperor zhongzong was dominated by empress wei, so too was ruizong dominated by princess taiping. this was finally ended when princess taipings coup failed in 712 during the 44-year reign of emperor xuanzong, the tang dynasty reached its height, a golden age with low economic inflation and a toned down lifestyle for the imperial court. seen as a progressive and benevolent ruler, xuanzong even abolished the death penalty in the year 747; all executions had to be approved beforehand by the emperor himself  xuanzong bowed to the consensus of his ministers on policy decisions and made efforts to staff government ministries fairly with different political factions. his staunch confucian chancellor zhang jiuling  after 737, most of xuanzongs confidence rested in his long-standing chancellor li linfu, who championed a more aggressive foreign policy employing non-chinese generals. this policy ultimately created the conditions for a massive rebellion against xuanzong.the tang empire was at its height of power up until the middle of the 8th century, when the an lushan rebellion  yet most of his campaigns against the khitans were unsuccessful. he was given great responsibility in hebei, which allowed him to rebel with an army of more than 100,000 troops. after capturing luoyang, he named himself emperor of a new, but short-lived, yan state. despite early victories scored by tang general guo ziyi  while the heir apparent raised troops in shanxi and xuanzong fled to sichuan province, they called upon the help of the uyghur khaganate in 756. the uyghur khan moyanchur was greatly excited at this prospect, and married his own daughter to the chinese diplomatic envoy once he arrived, receiving in turn a chinese princess as his bride. the uyghurs helped recapture the tang capital from the rebels, but they refused to leave until the tang paid them an enormous sum of tribute in silk. even abbasid arabs assisted the tang in putting down an lushans rebellion. the tibetans took hold of the opportunity and raided many areas under chinese control, and even after the tibetan empire had fallen apart in 842  so significant was this loss that half a century later jinshi examination candidates were required to write an essay on the causes of the tangs decline. although an lushan was killed by one of his eunuchs in 757, this time of troubles and widespread insurrection continued until rebel shi siming was killed by his own son in 763.one of the legacies that the tang government left since 710 was the gradual rise of regional military governors, the jiedushi, who slowly came to challenge the power of the central government. after the an lushan rebellion, the autonomous power and authority accumulated by the jiedushi in hebei went beyond the central governments control. after a series of rebellions between 781 and 784 in todays hebei, shandong, hubei and henan provinces, the government had to officially acknowledge the jiedushis hereditary ruling without accreditation. the tang government relied on these governors and their armies for protection and to suppress locals that would take up arms against the government. in return, the central government would acknowledge the rights of these governors to maintain their army, collect taxes and even to pass on their title to heirs. as time passed, these military governors slowly phased out the prominence of civil officials drafted by exams, and became more autonomous from central authority. the rule of these powerful military governors lasted until 960, when a new civil order under the song dynasty was established. also, the abandonment of the equal-field system meant that people could buy and sell land freely. many poor fell into debt because of this, forced to sell their land to the wealthy, which led to the exponential growth of large estates. with the breakdown of the land allocation system after 755, the central chinese state barely interfered in agricultural management and acted merely as tax collector for roughly a millennium, save a few instances such as the songs failed land nationalization during the 13th-century war with the mongols.with the central government collapsing in authority over the various regions of the empire, it was recorded in 845 that bandits and river pirates in parties of 100 or more began plundering settlements along the yangtze river with little resistance. in 858, massive floods along the grand canal inundated vast tracts of land and terrain of the north china plain, which drowned tens of thousands of people in the process.the chinese belief in the mandate of heaven granted to the ailing tang was also challenged when natural calamities occurred, forcing many to believe that the tang had lost their right to rule. furthermore, in 873 a disastrous harvest shook the foundations of the empire; in some areas only half of all agricultural produce was gathered, and tens of thousands faced famine and starvation. in the earlier period of the tang, the central government was able to meet crises in the harvest, as it was recorded from 714 to 719 that the tang government responded effectively to natural disasters by extending the price-regulation granary system throughout the country. the central government was able then to build a large surplus stock of foods to ward off the rising danger of famine and increased agricultural productivity through land reclamation. in the 9th century, however, the tang government was nearly helpless in dealing with any calamity.although these natural calamities and rebellions stained the reputation and hampered the effectiveness of the central government, the early 9th century is nonetheless viewed as a period of recovery for the tang dynasty. the governments withdrawal from its role in managing the economy had the unintended effect of stimulating trade, as more markets with less bureaucratic restrictions were opened up. by 780, the old grain tax and labor service of the 7th century was replaced by a semiannual tax paid in cash, signifying the shift to a money economy boosted by the merchant class. cities in the jiangnan region to the south, such as yangzhou, suzhou, and hangzhou prospered the most economically during the late tang period. the government monopoly on the production of salt, weakened after the an lushan rebellion, was placed under the salt commission, which became one of the most powerful state agencies, run by capable ministers chosen as specialists. the commission began the practice of selling merchants the rights to buy monopoly salt, which they would then transport and sell in local markets. in 799 salt accounted for over half of the governments revenues. s.a.m. adshead writes that this salt tax represents ""the first time that an indirect tax, rather than tribute, levies on land or people, or profit from state enterprises such as mines, had been the primary resource of a major state."" even after the power of the central government was in decline after the mid 8th century, it was still able to function and give out imperial orders on a massive scale. the tangshu , in the second month...a standard model of the chain pump was issued from the palace, and the people of jingzhao fu the last great ambitious ruler of the tang dynasty was emperor xianzong  he also had an effective well trained imperial army stationed at the capital led by his court eunuchs; this was the army of divine strategy, numbering 240,000 in strength as recorded in 798. between the years 806 and 819, emperor xianzong conducted seven major military campaigns to quell the rebellious provinces that had claimed autonomy from central authority, managing to subdue all but two of them. under his reign there was a brief end to the hereditary jiedushi, as xianzong appointed his own military officers and staffed the regional bureaucracies once again with civil officials. however, xianzongs successors proved less capable and more interested in the leisure of hunting, feasting, and playing outdoor sports, allowing eunuchs to amass more power as drafted scholar-officials caused strife in the bureaucracy with factional parties. the eunuchs power became unchallenged after emperor wenzongs however, the tang did manage to restore at least indirect control over former tang territories as far west as the hexi corridor and dunhuang in gansu. in 848 the ethnic han chinese general zhang yichao  shortly afterwards emperor xu, scholar-officials served as intermediaries between the people and the government. yet the potential of a widespread examination system was not fully realized until the succeeding song dynasty, when the merit-driven scholar official largely shed his aristocratic habits and defined his social status through the examination system.the examination system, used only on a small scale in sui and tang times, played a central role in the fashioning of this new elite. the early song emperors, concerned above all to avoid domination of the government by military men, greatly expanded the civil service examination system and the government school system.from the outset, religion played a role in tang politics. in his bid for power, li yuan had attracted a following by claiming descent from the taoism sage lao tzu  people bidding for office would request the prayers of buddhist monks, with successful aspirants making donations in return. before the persecution of buddhism in the 9th century, buddhism and taoism were both accepted.religion was central in the reign of emperor xuanzong emperor xuanzong closely regulated religious finances. near the beginning of his reign in 713, he liquidated the inexhaustible treasury of a prominent buddhist monastery in changan which had collected vast riches as multitudes of anonymous repentants left money, silk, and treasure at its doors. although the monastery used its funds generously, the emperor condemned it for fraudulent banking practices, and distributed its wealth to other buddhist and taoist monasteries, and to repair local statues, halls, and bridges. in 714, he forbade changan shops from selling copied buddhist sutras, giving a monopoly of this trade to the buddhist clergy.the tang dynasty government attempted to create an accurate census of the empires population, mostly for effective taxation and military conscription. the early tang government established modest grain and cloth taxes on each household, persuading households to register and provide the government with accurate demographic information. in the official census of 609, the population was tallied at 9. patricia ebrey writes that nonwithstanding census undercounting, chinas population had not grown significantly since the earlier han dynasty, which recorded 58. s.a.m. adshead disagrees, estimating about 751 prefectures, and 1,538 counties throughout the empire. although there were many large and prominent cities, the rural and agrarian areas comprised some 80 to 90% of the population. there was also a dramatic migration from northern to southern china, as the north held 75% of the overall population at the dynastys inception, which by its end was reduced to 50%.chinese population would not dramatically increase until the song dynasty, when it doubled to 100 the total number of enlisted troops in the tang armies had risen to about 500,000 men.in east asia, tang chinese military campaigns were less successful elsewhere than in previous imperial chinese dynasties. like the emperors of the sui dynasty before him, taizong established a military campaign in 644 against the korean kingdom of goguryeo in the goguryeo0,000 turks against them, distributing khitan livestock and women to the turks as a reward. on two occasions between 635 and 636, tang royal princesses were married to turk mercenaries or generals in chinese service. throughout the tang dynasty until the end of 755, there were approximately ten turkic generals serving under the tang. while most of the tang army was made of fubing chinese conscripts, the majority of the troops led by turkic generals were of non-chinese origin, campaigning largely in the western frontier where the presence of fubing troops was low. some ""turkic"" troops were tribalized han chinese, a desinicized people.civil war in china was almost totally diminished by 626, along with the defeat in 628 of the ordos chinese warlord liang shidu; after these internal conflicts, the tang began an offensive against the turks. in the year 630, tang armies captured areas of the ordos desert, modern-day inner mongolia province, and southern mongolia from the turks. after this military victory, emperor taizong won the title of great khan from the various turks in the region who pledged their allegiance to both him and the chinese empire while the turks were settled in the ordos region  during emperor taizongs reign alone, large campaigns were launched against not only the g, and in 763 the tibetans even captured the capital of china, changan, for fifteen days during the an shi rebellion. in fact, it was during this rebellion that the tang withdrew its western garrisons stationed in what is now gansu and qinghai, which the tibetans then occupied along with the territory of what is now xinjiang. hostilities between the tang and tibet continued until they signed a formal peace treaty in 821. the terms of this treaty, including the fixed borders between the two countries, are recorded in a bilingual inscription on a stone pillar outside the jokhang temple in lhasa.during the islamic conquest of persia  according to the old book of tang, peroz was made the head of a governorate of persia in what is now zaranj, afghanistan. during this conquest of persia, the rashidun caliph uthman ibn affan  arab sources claim umayyad commander qutayba ibn muslim briefly took kashgar from china and withdrew after an agreement, but modern historians entirely dismiss this claim. the arab umayyad caliphate in 715 desposed ikhshid, the king the fergana valley, and installed a new king alutar on the throne. the deposed king fled to kucha  the tang dynasty chinese defeated the arab umayyad invaders at the battle of aksu  the turgesh then crushed the arab umayyads and drove them out. by the 740s, the arabs under the abbasid caliphate in khorasan had reestablished a presence in the ferghana basin and in sogdiana. at the battle of talas in 751, karluk mercenaries under the chinese defected, helping the arab armies of the caliphate to defeat the tang force under commander gao xianzhi. although the battle itself was not of the greatest significance militarily, this was a pivotal moment in history, as it marks the spread of chinese papermaking into regions west of china as captured chinese soldiers shared the technique of papermaking to the arabs. these techniques ultimately reached europe by the 12th century through arab-controlled spain. although they had fought at talas, on june 11, 758, an abbasid embassy arrived at changan simultaneously with the uighur turks bearing gifts for the tang emperor. in 788,1002, lost it to the tibetans in 737, and regained it under the command of the goguryeo-korean general gao xianzhi. when the an lushan rebellion ended in 763, the tang empire withdrew its troops from its western lands, allowing the tibetan empire to largely cut off chinas direct access to the silk road. an internal rebellion in 848 ousted the tibetan rulers, and tang china regained its northwestern prefectures from tibet in 851. these lands contained crucial grazing areas and pastures for raising horses that the tang dynasty desperately needed.despite the many expatriate european travelers coming into china to live and trade, many travelers, mainly religious monks and missionaries, recorded chinas stringent immigrant laws . as the monk xuanzang and many other monk travelers attested to, there were many chinese government checkpoints along the silk road that examined travel permits into the tang empire. furthermore, banditry was a problem along the checkpoints and oasis towns, as xuanzang also recorded that his group of travelers were assaulted by bandits on multiple occasions.the silk road also affected tang dynasty art. horses became a significant symbol of prosperity and power as well as an instrument of military and diplomatic policy. horses were also revered as a relative of the dragon.chinese envoys have been sailing through the indian ocean to india since perhaps the 2nd century bc, yet it was during the tang dynasty that a strong chinese maritime presence  could be found in the persian gulf and red sea, into persia, mesopotamia during the tang dynasty, thousands of foreign expatriate merchants came and lived in numerous chinese cities to do business with china, including persians, arabs, hindu indians, malays, bengalis, sinhalese, khmers, chams, jews and nestorian christians of the near east, among many others. in 748, the buddhist monk jian zhen described guangzhou as a bustling mercantile business center where many large and impressive foreign ships came to dock. he wrote that ""many large ships came from borneo, persia, qunglun  as written in the yue jue shu  the tang government reacted by shutting the port of canton down for roughly five decades; thus, foreign vessels docked at hanoi instead. however, when the port reopened, it continued to thrive. in 851 the arab merchant sulaiman al-tajir observed the manufacturing of chinese porcelain in guangzhou and admired its transparent quality. he also provided a description of guangzhous landmarks, granaries, local government administration, some of its written records, treatment of travelers, along with the use of ceramics, rice, wine, and tea. their presence came to an end under the revenge of chinese rebel huang chao in 878, who purportedly slaughtered thousands regardless of ethnicity. huangs rebellion was eventually suppressed in 884.vessels from neighboring east asian states such as silla and balhae of korea and the hizen province of japan were all involved in the yellow sea trade, which silla dominated. after silla and japan reopened renewed hostilities in the late 7th century, most japanese maritime merchants chose to set sail from nagasaki towards the mouth of the huai river, the yangtze river, and even as far south as the hangzhou bay in order to avoid korean ships in the yellow sea. in order to sail back to japan in 838, the japanese embassy to china procured nine ships and sixty korean sailors from the korean wards of chuzhou and lianshui cities along the huai river. it is also known that chinese trade ships traveling to japan set sail from the various ports along the coasts of zhejiang and fujian provinces.the chinese engaged in large-scale production for overseas export by at least the time of the tang. this was proven by the discovery of the belitung shipwreck, a silt-preserved shipwrecked arabian dhow in the gaspar strait near belitung, which had 63,000 pieces of tang ceramics, silver, and gold  beginning in 785, the chinese began to call regularly at sufala on the east african coast in order to cut out arab middlemen, with various contemporary chinese sources giving detailed descriptions of trade in africa. the official and geographer jia dan  in 863 the chinese author duan chengshi  in fustat  from this time period, the arab merchant shulama once wrote of his admiration for chinese seafaring junks, but noted that their draft was too deep for them to enter the euphrates river, which forced them to ferry passengers and cargo in small boats. shulama also noted that chinese ships were often very large, with capacities up to 600 official temples, 7 churches of foreign religions, 10 city wards with provincial transmission offices, 12 major inns, and 6 graveyards. some city wards were literally filled with open public playing fields or the backyards of lavish mansions for playing horse polo and cuju  in 662, emperor gaozong moved the imperial court to the daming palace, which became the political center of the empire and served as the royal residence of the tang emperors for more than 220 years.the tang capital was the largest city in the world at its time, the population of the city wards and its suburban countryside reaching two million inhabitants. the tang capital was very cosmopolitan, with ethnicities of persia, central asia, japan, korea, vietnam, tibet, india, and many other places living within. naturally, with this plethora of different ethnicities living in changan, there were also many different practiced religions, such as buddhism, nestorian christianity, and zoroastrianism, among others. with the open access to china that the silk road to the west facilitated, many foreign settlers were able to move east to china, while the city of changan itself had about 25,000 foreigners living within. exotic green-eyed, blond-haired tocharian ladies serving wine in agate and amber cups, singing, and dancing at taverns attracted customers. if a foreigner in china pursued a chinese woman for marriage, he was required to stay in china and was unable to take his bride back to his homeland, as stated in a law passed in 628 to protect women from temporary marriages with foreign envoys. several laws enforcing segregation of foreigners from chinese were passed during the tang dynasty. in 779 the tang dynasty issued an edict which forced uighurs in the capital, changan, to wear their ethnic dress, stopped them from marrying chinese females, and banned them from passing off as chinese.changan was the center of the central government, the home of the imperial family, and was filled with splendor and wealth. however, incidentally it was not the economic hub during the tang dynasty. the city of yangzhou along the grand canal and close to the yangtze river was the greatest economic center during the tang era.yangzhou was the headquarters for the tang governments salt monopoly, and was the greatest industrial center of china. it acted as a midpoint in shipping of foreign goods that would be organized and distributed to the major cities of the north. much like the seaport of guangzhou in the south, yangzhou boasted thousands of foreign traders from all across asia.there was also the secondary capital city of luoyang, which was the favored capital of the two by empress wu. in the year 691 she had more than 100,000 families  as early as 736, granaries were built at critical points along the route from yangzhou to changan, which eliminated shipment delays, spoilage, and pilfering. an artificial lake used as a transshipment pool was dredged east of changan in 743, where curious northerners could finally see the array of boats found in southern china, delivering tax and tribute items to the imperial court.the tang period was a golden age of chinese literature and art. over 48,900 poems penned by some 2,200 tang authors have survived to the present day. skill in the composition of poetry became a required study for those wishing to pass imperial examinations, while poetry was also heavily competitive; poetry contests amongst guests at banquets and courtiers were common. poetry styles that were popular in the tang included gushi and jintishi, with the renowned poet li bai  tang poems remained popular and great emulation of tang era poetry began in the song dynasty; in that period, yan yu the classical prose movement was spurred in large part by the writings of tang authors liu zongyuan  this guwen short story fiction and tales were also popular during the tang, one of the more famous ones being yingyings biography by yuan zhen  timothy c. wong places this story within the wider context of tang love tales, which often share the plot designs of quick passion, inescapable societal pressure leading to the abandonment of romance, followed by a period of melancholy. wong states that this scheme lacks the undying vows and total self-commitment to love found in western romances such as romeo and juliet, but that underlying traditional chinese values of inseparableness of self from ones environment there were large encyclopedias published in the tang. the yiwen leiju encyclopedia was compiled in 624 by the chief editor ouyang xun  confirming jias reports about lighthouses in the persian gulf, arabic writers a century after jia wrote of the same structures, writers such as al-masudi and al-muqaddasi. the tang dynasty chinese diplomat wang xuance traveled to magadha  afterwards he wrote the book zhang tianzhu guotu many histories of previous dynasties were compiled between 636 and 659 by court officials during and shortly after the reign of emperor taizong of tang. these included the book of liang, book of chen, book of northern qi, book of zhou, book of sui, book of jin, history of northern dynasties and the history of southern dynasties. although not included in the official twenty-four histories, the tongdian and tang huiyao were nonetheless valuable written historical works of the tang period. the shitong written by liu zhiji in 710 was a meta-history, as it covered the history of chinese historiography in past centuries until his time. the great tang records on the western regions, compiled by bianji, recounted the journey of xuanzang, the tang eras most renowned buddhist monk.other important literary offerings included duan chengshis since ancient times, some chinese had believed in folk religion and taoism that incorporated many deities. practitioners believed the tao and the afterlife was a reality parallel to the living world, complete with its own bureaucracy and afterlife currency needed by dead ancestors. funerary practices included providing the deceased with everything they might need in the afterlife, including animals, servants, entertainers, hunters, homes, and officials. this ideal is reflected in tang dynasty art. this is also reflected in many short stories written in the tang about people accidentally winding up in the realm of the dead, only to come back and report their experiences.buddhism, originating in india around the time of confucius, continued its influence during the tang period and was accepted by some members of imperial family, becoming thoroughly sinicized and a permanent part of chinese traditional culture. in an age before neo-confucianism and figures such as zhu xi  buddhist monasteries were also engaged in the economy, since their land property and serfs gave them enough revenues to set up mills, oil presses, and other enterprises. although the monasteries retained serfs, these monastery dependents could actually own property and employ others to help them in their work, including their own slaves.the prominent status of buddhism in chinese culture began to decline as the dynasty and central government declined as well during the late 8th century to 9th century. buddhist convents and temples that were exempt from state taxes beforehand were targeted by the state for taxation. in 845 emperor wuzong of tang finally shut down 4,600 buddhist monasteries along with 40,000 temples and shrines, forcing 260,000 buddhist monks and nuns to return to secular life; this episode would later be dubbed one of the four buddhist persecutions in china. although the ban would be lifted just a few years after, buddhism never regained its once dominant status in chinese culture. this situation also came about through a revival of interest in native chinese philosophies such as confucianism and taoism. han yu  although his contemporaries found him crude and obnoxious, he would foreshadow the later persecution of buddhism in the tang, as well as the revival of confucian theory with the rise of neo-confucianism of the song dynasty. nonetheless, chnd to 4th centuries, soon afterwards they largely converted to zoroastrianism due to their links to sassanid persia. sogdian merchants and their families living in cities such as changan, luoyang, and xiangyang usually built a zoroastrian temple once their local communities grew larger than 100 households. sogdians were also responsible for spreading manicheism in tang china and the uighur khaganate. the uighurs built the first manichean monastery in china in 768, yet in 843 the tang government ordered that the property of all manichean monasteries be confiscated in response to the outbreak of war with the uighurs. with the blanket ban on foreign religions two years later, manicheism was driven underground and never flourished in china again.much more than earlier periods, the tang era was renowned for the time reserved for leisure activity, especially for those in the upper classes. many outdoor sports and activities were enjoyed during the tang, including archery, hunting, horse polo, cuju  cockfighting, and even tug of war. government officials were granted vacations during their tenure in office. officials were granted 30 days off every three years to visit their parents if they lived 1,0008 and 758, the imperial throne bestowed a total of sixty-nine grand carnivals nationwide, granted by the emperor in the case of special circumstances such as important military victories, abundant harvests after a long drought or famine, the granting of amnesties, the installment of a new crown prince, etc. for special celebration in the tang era, lavish and gargantuan-sized feasts were sometimes prepared, as the imperial court had staffed agencies to prepare the meals. this included a prepared feast for 1,100 elders of changan in 664, a feast for 3,500 officers of the divine strategy army in 768, and a feast for 1,200 women of the palace and members of the imperial family in the year 826. drinking wine and alcoholic beverages was heavily ingrained into chinese culture, as people drank for nearly every social event. a court official in the 8th century allegedly had a serpentine-shaped structure called the ale grotto built with 50,000 bricks on the groundfloor that each featured a bowl from which his friends could drink.in general, garments were made from silk, wool, or linen depending on your social status and what you could afford. furthermore, there were laws that specified what kinds of clothing could be worn by whom. the color of the clothing also indicated rank. ""purple colored clothes were used by officials above the third grade; light red were meant for officials above the fifth grade; dark green was limited to the sixth grade and above officials; light green was solely for officials above the seventh grade; dark cyan was exclusive for officials above the eighth grade; light cyan garments adorned officials above the ninth grade. the common people and all those who did not reside in the palace were allowed to wear yellow colored clothes.""  during this period, chinas power, culture, economy, and influence were thriving. as a result, women could afford to wear loose-fitting, wide-sleeved garments. even lower-class womens robes would have sleeves four to five feet in width.concepts of womens social rights and social status during the tang era were notably liberal-minded for the period. however, this was largely reserved for urban women of elite status, as men and women in the rural countryside labored hard in their different set of tasks; with wives and daughters responsible for more domestic tasks of weaving textiles and rearing of silk worms, while men tended to farming in the fields.there were many women in the tang era who gained access to religious authority by taking vows as taoist priestesses. the head mistresses of high-class courtesans in the north hamlet of the capital changan acquired large amounts of wealth and power. said courtesans, who likely influenced the japanese geishas, were well respected. these courtesans were known as great singers and poets, supervised banquets and feasts, knew the rules to all the drinking games, and were trained to have the utmost respectable table manners.although they were renowned for their polite behavior, the courtesans were known to dominate the conversation among elite men, and were not afraid to openly castigate or criticize prominent male guests who talked too much or too loudly, boasted too much of their accomplishments, or had in some way ruined dinner for everyone by rude behavior  when singing to entertain guests, courtesans not only composed the lyrics to their own songs, but they popularized a new form of lyrical verse by singing lines written by various renowned and famous men in chinese history.it was fashionable for women to be full-figured  the foreign horse-riding sport of polo from persia became a wildly popular trend among the chinese elite, and women often played the sport  the preferred hairstyle for women was to bunch their hair up like ""an elaborate edifice above the forehead"", while affluent ladies wore extravagant head ornaments, combs, pearl necklaces, face powders, and perfumes. hairstyle and dress of tang dynasty court lady figures were sculpted and can be reflected on the trend of fashion at the time when tang dynasty was heavily influenced by turfan, central asia.  a law was passed in 671 which attempted to force women to wear hats with veils again in order to promote decency, but these laws were ignored as some women started wearing caps and even no hats at all, as well as mens riding clothes and boots, and tight-sleeved bodices.there were some prominent court women after the era of empress wu, such as yang guifei during the earlier northern and southern dynasties  during the tang dynasty, tea became synonymous with everything sophisticated in society. the poet lu tong  although wrapping paper had been used in china since the 2nd century bc, during the tang dynasty the chinese were using wrapping paper as folded and sewn square bags to hold and preserve the flavor of tea leaves. indeed, paper found many other uses besides writing and wrapping during the tang era.earlier, the first recorded use of toilet paper was made in 589 by the scholar-official yan zhitui  and in 851 an arab traveler commented on how he believed that tang era chinese were not careful about cleanliness because they did not wash with water in ancient times, the chinese had outlined the five most basic foodstuffs known as the five grains: sesamum, legumes, wheat, panicled millet, and glutinous millet. the ming dynasty encyclopedist song yingxing  but song yingxing also noted that in the ming dynasty, seven tenths of civilians food was rice. in fact, in the tang dynasty rice was not only the most important staple in southern china, but had also become popular in the north, which was for a long time the center of china.during the tang dynasty, wheat replaced the position of millet and became the main staple crop. as a consequence, wheat cake shared a considerable amount in the staple of tang. there were four main kinds of cake: steamed cake, boiled cake, pancake, and hu cake.steamed cake was consumed commonly by both civilians and aristocrats. like the rougamo in modern chinese cuisine, steamed cake was usually stuffed by meat and vegetable. there were plenty of shops and packmen selling steamed cake in chang94 volumes, covered the history of china from the beginning of the warring states (403 bc until the beginning of the song dynasty (960.",1,0

"bcdfghikmnpqrstuwegyptian mythology is the collection of myths from ancient egypt, which describe the actions of the egyptian gods as a means of understanding the world around them. the beliefs that these myths express are an important part of ancient egyptian religion. myths appear frequently in egyptian writings and art, particularly in short stories and in religious material such as hymns, ritual texts, funerary texts, and temple decoration. these sources rarely contain a complete account of a myth and often describe only brief fragments.inspired by the cycles of nature, the egyptians saw time in the present as a series of recurring patterns, whereas the earliest periods of time were linear. myths are set in these earliest times, and myth sets the pattern for the cycles of the present. present events repeat the events of myth, and in doing so renew maat, the fundamental order of the universe. amongst the most important episodes from the mythic past are the creation myths, in which the gods form the universe out of primordial chaos; the stories of the reign of the sun god ra upon the earth; and the osiris myth, concerning the struggles of the gods osiris, isis, and horus against the disruptive god set. events from the present that might be regarded as myths include ras daily journey through the world and its otherworldly counterpart, the duat. recurring themes in these mythic episodes include the conflict between the upholders of maat and the forces of disorder, the importance of the pharaoh in maintaining maat, and the continual death and regeneration of the gods.the details of these sacred events differ greatly from one text to another and often seem contradictory. egyptian myths are primarily metaphorical, translating the essence and behavior of deities into terms that humans can understand. each variant of a myth represents a different symbolic perspective, enriching the egyptians understanding of the gods and the world.mythology profoundly influenced egyptian culture. it inspired or influenced many religious rituals and provided the ideological basis for kingship. scenes and symbols from myth appeared in art in tombs, temples, and amulets. in literature, myths or elements of them were used in stories that range from humor to allegory, demonstrating that the egyptians adapted mythology to serve a wide variety of purposes.the development of egyptian myth is difficult to trace. egyptologists must make educated guesses about its earliest phases, based on written sources that appeared much later. one obvious influence on myth is the egyptians natural surroundings. each day the sun rose and set, bringing light to the land and regulating human activity; each year the nile flooded, renewing the fertility of the soil and allowing the highly productive farming that sustained egyptian civilization. thus the egyptians saw water and the sun as symbols of life and thought of time as a series of natural cycles. this orderly pattern was at constant risk of disruption: unusually low floods resulted in famine, and high floods destroyed crops and buildings. the hospitable nile valley was surrounded by harsh desert, populated by peoples the egyptians regarded as uncivilized enemies of order. for these reasons, the egyptians saw their land as an isolated place of stability, or maat, surrounded and endangered by chaos. these themes\x80\x94and the repetition of the first sunrise at the moment of creation. at this moment, the rising sun god swallows the stars once more, absorbing their power. in this revitalized state, ra is depicted as a child or as the scarab beetle god khepri, both of which represent rebirth in egyptian iconography.egyptian texts typically treat the dissolution of the world as a possibility to be avoided, and for that reason they do not often describe it in detail. however, many texts allude to the idea that the world, after countless cycles of renewal, is destined to end. this end is described in a passage in the coffin texts and a more explicit one in the book of the dead, in which atum says that he will one day dissolve the ordered world and return to his primeval, inert state within the waters of chaos. all things other than the creator will cease to exist, except osiris, who will survive along with him. details about this eschatological prospect are left unclear, including the fate of the dead who are associated with osiris. yet with the creator god and the god of renewal together in the waters that gave rise to the orderly world, there is the potential for a new creation to arise in the same manner as the old.because the egyptians rarely described theological ideas explicitly, the implicit ideas of mythology formed much of the basis for egyptian religion. the purpose of egyptian religion was the maintenance of maat, and the concepts that myths express were believed to be essential to maat. the rituals of egyptian religion were meant to make the mythic events, and the concepts they represented, real once more, thereby renewing maat. the rituals were believed to achieve this effect through the force of heka, the same connection between the physical and divine realms that enabled the original creation.for this reason, egyptian rituals often included actions that symbolized mythical events. temple rites included the destruction of models representing malign gods like set or apophis, private magical spells called upon isis to heal the sick as she did for horus, and funerary rites such as the opening of the mouth ceremony and ritual offerings to the dead evoked the myth of osiris resurrection. yet rituals rarely, if ever, involved dramatic reenactments of myths. there are borderline cases, like a ceremony alluding to the osiris myth in which two women took on the roles of isis and nephthys, but scholars disagree about whether these performances formed sequences of events. much of egyptian ritual was focused on more basic activities like giving offerings to the gods, with mythic themes serving as ideological background rather than as the focus of a rite. nevertheless, myth and ritual strongly influenced each other. myths could inspire rituals, like the ceremony with isis and nephthys; and rituals that did not originally have a mythic meaning could be reinterpreted as having one, as in the case of offering ceremonies, in which food and other items given to the gods or the dead were equated with the eye of horus.kingship was a key element of egyptian religion, through the kings role as link between humanity and the gods. myths explain the background for this connection between royalty and divinity. the myths about the ennead establish the king as heir to the lineage of rulers reaching back to the creator; the myth of divine birth states that the king is the son and heir of a god; and the myths about osiris and horus emphasize that rightful succession to the throne is essential to the maintenance of maat. thus, mythology provided the rationale for the very nature of egyptian government.illustrations of gods and mythical events appear extensively alongside religious writing in tombs, temples, and funerary texts. mythological scenes in egyptian artwork are rarely placed in sequence as a narrative, but individual scenes, particularly depicting the resurrection of osiris, do sometimes appear in religious artwork.allusions to myth were very widespread in egyptian art and architecture. in temple design, the central path of the temple axis was likened to the sun gods path across the sky, and the sanctuary at the end of the path represented the place of creation from which he rose. temple decoration was filled with solar emblems that underscored this relationship. similarly, the corridors of tombs were linked with the gods journey through the duat, and the burial chamber with the tomb of osiris. the pyramid, the best-known of all egyptian architectural forms, may have been inspired by mythic symbolism, for it represented the mound of creation and the original sunrise, appropriate for a monument intended to assure the owners rebirth after death. symbols in egyptian tradition were frequently reinterpreted, so that the meanings of mythical symbols could change and multiply over time like the myths themselves.more ordinary works of art were also designed to evoke mythic themes, like the amulets that egyptians commonly wore to invoke divine powers. the eye of horus, for instance, was a very common shape for protective amulets because it represented horus well-being after the restoration of his lost eye. scarab-shaped amulets symbolized the regeneration of life, referring to the god khepri, the form that the sun god was said to take at dawn.themes and motifs from mythology appear frequently in egyptian literature, even outside of religious writings. an early instruction text, the ""teaching for king merykara"" from the middle kingdom, contains a brief reference to a myth of some kind, possibly the destruction of mankind; the earliest known egyptian short story, ""tale of the shipwrecked sailor"", incorporates ideas about the gods and the eventual dissolution of the world into a story set in the past. some later stories take much of their plot from mythical events: ""tale of the two brothers"" adapts parts of the osiris myth into a fantastic story about ordinary people, and ""the blinding of truth by falsehood"" transforms the conflict between horus and set into an allegory.a fragment of a text about the actions of horus and set dates to the middle kingdom, suggesting that stories about the gods arose in that era. several texts of this type are known from the new kingdom, and many more were written in the late and greco-roman periods. although these texts are more clearly derived from myth than those mentioned above, they still adapt the myths for non-religious purposes. ""the contendings of horus and seth"", from the new kingdom, tells the story of the conflict between the two gods, often with a humorous and seemingly irreverent tone. the roman-era ""myth of the eye of the sun"" incorporates fables into a framing story taken from myth. the goals of written fiction could also affect the narratives in magical texts, as with the new kingdom story ""isis, the rich womans son, and the fishermans wife"", which conveys a moral message unconnected to its magical purpose. the variety of ways that these stories treat mythology demonstrates the wide range of purposes that myth could serve in egyptian culture.",1,0
"ovis guineensis linnaeus,teauneuf-les-martigues near present-day marseille in the south of france, were among the first in europe to keep domestic sheep. practically from its inception, ancient greek civilization relied on sheep as primary livestock, and were even said to name individual animals. ancient romans kept sheep on a wide scale, and were an important agent in the spread of sheep raising. pliny the elder, in his natural history  european colonists spread the practice to the new world from 1493 onwards.domestic sheep are relatively small ruminants, usually with a crimped hair called wool and often with horns forming a lateral spiral. domestic sheep differ from their wild relatives and ancestors in several respects, having become uniquely neotenic as a result of selective breeding by humans. a few primitive breeds of sheep retain some of the characteristics of their wild cousins, such as short tails. depending on breed, domestic sheep may have no horns at all another trait unique to domestic sheep as compared to wild ovines is their wide variation in color. wild sheep are largely variations of brown hues, and variation within species is extremely limited. colors of domestic sheep range from pure white to dark chocolate brown, and even spotted or piebald. selection for easily dyeable white fleeces began early in sheep domestication, and as white wool is a dominant trait it spread quickly. however, colored sheep do appear in many modern breeds, and may even appear as a recessive trait in white flocks. while white wool is desirable for large commercial markets, there is a niche market for colored fleeces, mostly for handspinning. the nature of the fleece varies widely among the breeds, from dense and highly crimped, to long and hairlike. there is variation of wool type and quality even among members of the same flock, so wool classing is a step in the commercial processing of the fibre.depending on breed, sheep show a range of heights and weights. their rate of growth and mature weight is a heritable trait that is often selected for in breeding. ewes typically weigh between 45 and 100 kilograms  when all deciduous teeth have erupted, the sheep has 20 teeth. mature sheep have 32 teeth. as with other ruminants, the front teeth in the lower jaw bite against a hard, toothless pad in the upper jaw. these are used to pick off vegetation, then the rear teeth grind it before it is swallowed. there are eight lower front teeth in ruminants, but there is some disagreement as to whether these are eight incisors, or six incisors and two incisor-shaped canines. this means that the dental formula for sheep is either 0.0.3.34.0.3.3 or 0.0.3.33.1.3.3  there is a large diastema between the incisors and the molars.in the first few years of life one can calculate the age of sheep from their front teeth, as a pair of milk teeth is replaced by larger adult teeth each year, the full set of eight adult front teeth being complete at about four years of age. the front teeth are then gradually lost as sheep age, making it harder for them to feed and hindering the health and productivity of the animal. for this reason, domestic sheep on normal pasture begin to slowly decline from four years on, and the life expectancy of a sheep is 10 to 12 years, though some sheep may live as long as 20 years. sheep have good hearing, and are sensitive to noise when being handled. sheep have horizontal slit-shaped pupils, with excellent peripheral vision; with visual fields of about 270000 breeds now in existence were created to serve these diverse purposes. some sources give a count of a thousand or more breeds, but these numbers cannot be verified, according to some sources. however, several hundred breeds of sheep have been identified by the food and agriculture organization of the un  1314 breeds as of 1995  and 1229 breeds as of 2006.  almost all sheep are classified as being best suited to furnishing a certain product: wool, meat, milk, hides, or a combination in a dual-purpose breed. other features used when classifying sheep include face color  a sheep may also be of a fat-tailed type, which is a dual-purpose sheep common in africa and asia with larger deposits of fat within and around its tail.breeds are often categorized by the type of their wool. fine wool breeds are those that have wool of great crimp and density, which are preferred for textiles. most of these were derived from merino sheep, and the breed continues to dominate the world sheep industry. downs breeds have wool between the extremes, and are typically fast-growing meat and ram breeds with dark faces. some major medium wool breeds, such as the corriedale, are dual-purpose crosses of long and fine-wooled breeds and were created for high-production commercial flocks. long wool breeds are the largest of sheep, with long wool and a slow rate of growth. long wool sheep are most valued for crossbreeding to improve the attributes of other sheep types. for example: the american columbia breed was developed by crossing lincoln rams a minor class of sheep are the dairy breeds. dual-purpose breeds that may primarily be meat or wool sheep are often used secondarily as milking animals, but there are a few breeds that are predominantly used for milking. these sheep produce a higher quantity of milk and have slightly longer lactation curves. in the quality of their milk, the fat and protein content percentages of dairy sheep vary from non-dairy breeds, but lactose content does not.a last group of sheep breeds is that of fur or hair sheep, which do not grow wool at all. hair sheep are similar to the early domesticated sheep kept before woolly breeds were developed, and are raised for meat and pelts. some modern breeds of hair sheep, such as the dorper, result from crosses between wool and hair breeds. for meat and hide producers, hair sheep are cheaper to keep, as they do not need shearing. hair sheep are also more resistant to parasites and hot weather.with the modern rise of corporate agribusiness and the decline of localized family farms, many breeds of sheep are in danger of extinction. the rare breeds survival trust of the uk lists 22 native breeds as having only 3,000 registered animals  preferences for breeds with uniform characteristics and fast growth have pushed heritage  those that remain are maintained through the efforts of conservation organizations, breed registries, and individual farmers dedicated to their preservation.sheep are herbivorous mammals. most breeds prefer to graze on grass and other short roughage, avoiding the taller woody parts of plants that goats readily consume. both sheep and goats use their lips and tongues to select parts of the plant that are easier to digest or higher in nutrition. sheep, however, graze well in monoculture pastures where most goats fare poorly.like all ruminants, sheep have a complex digestive system composed of four chambers, allowing them to break down cellulose from stems, leaves, and seed hulls into simpler carbohydrates. when sheep graze, vegetation is chewed into a mass called a bolus, which is then passed into the rumen, via the reticulum. the rumen is a 19- to 38-liter  the fermenting organisms include bacteria, fungi, and protozoa.    the bolus is periodically regurgitated back to the mouth as cud for additional chewing and salivation. after fermentation in the rumen, feed passes into the reticulum and the omasum; special feeds such as grains may bypass the rumen altogether. after the first three chambers, food moves into the abomasum for final digestion before processing by the intestines. the abomasum is the only one of the four chambers analogous to the human stomach, and is sometimes called the ""true stomach"".other than forage, the other staple feed for sheep is hay, often during the winter months. the ability to thrive solely on pasture  also included in some sheeps diets are minerals, either in a trace mix or in licks. feed provided to sheep must be specially formulated, as most cattle, poultry, pig, and even some goat feeds contain levels of copper that are lethal to sheep. the same danger applies to mineral supplements such as salt licks.sheep follow a diurnal pattern of activity, feeding from dawn to dusk, stopping sporadically to rest and chew their cud. ideal pasture for sheep is not lawnlike grass, but an array of grasses, legumes and forbs. types of land where sheep are raised vary widely, from pastures that are seeded and improved intentionally to rough, native lands. common plants toxic to sheep are present in most of the world, and include sheep are largely grazing herbivores, unlike browsing animals such as goats and deer that prefer taller foliage. with a much narrower face, sheep crop plants very close to the ground and can overgraze a pasture much faster than cattle. for this reason, many shepherds use managed intensive rotational grazing, where a flock is rotated through multiple pastures, giving plants time to recover. paradoxically, sheep can both cause and solve the spread of invasive plant species. by disturbing the natural state of pasture, sheep and other livestock can pave the way for invasive plants. however, sheep also prefer to eat invasives such as cheatgrass, leafy spurge, kudzu and spotted knapweed over native species such as sagebrush, making grazing sheep effective for conservation grazing. research conducted in imperial county, california compared lamb grazing with herbicides for weed control in seedling alfalfa fields. three trials demonstrated that grazing lambs were just as effective as herbicides in controlling winter weeds. entomologists also compared grazing lambs to insecticides for insect control in winter alfalfa. in this trial, lambs provided insect control as effectively as insecticides.sheep are flock animals and strongly gregarious; much sheep behavior can be understood on the basis of these tendencies. the dominance hierarchy of sheep and their natural inclination to follow a leader to new pastures were the pivotal factors in sheep being one of the first domesticated livestock species. furthermore, in contrast to the red deer and gazelle   all sheep have a tendency to congregate close to other members of a flock, although this behavior varies with breed, and sheep can become stressed when separated from their flock members. during flocking, sheep have a strong tendency to follow, and a leader may simply be the first individual to move.  relationships in flocks tend to be closest among related sheep: in mixed-breed flocks, subgroups of the same breed tend to form, and a ewe and her direct descendants often move as a unit within large flocks.  sheep can become hefted to one particular local pasture flock behaviour in sheep is generally only exhibited in groups of four or more sheep; fewer sheep may not react as expected when alone or with few other sheep. being a prey species, the primary defense mechanism of sheep is to flee from danger when their flight zone is entered. cornered sheep may charge and butt, or threaten by hoof stamping and adopting an aggressive posture. this is particularly true for ewes with newborn lambs.in regions where sheep have no natural predators, none of the native breeds of sheep exhibit a strong flocking behavior.farmers exploit flocking behavior to keep sheep together on unfenced pastures such as hill farming, and to move them more easily. for this purpose shepherds may use herding dogs in this effort, with a highly bred herding ability. sheep are food-oriented, and association of humans with regular feeding often results in sheep soliciting people for food. those who are moving sheep may exploit this behavior by leading sheep with buckets of feed.sheep establish a dominance hierarchy through fighting, threats and competitiveness. dominant animals are inclined to be more aggressive with other sheep, and usually feed first at troughs. primarily among rams, horn size is a factor in the flock hierarchy. rams with different size horns may be less inclined to fight to establish the dominance order, while rams with similarly sized horns are more so. merinos have an almost linear hierarchy whereas there is a less rigid structure in border leicesters when a competitive feeding situation arises.in sheep, position in a moving flock is highly correlated with social dominance, but there is no definitive study to show consistent voluntary leadership by an individual sheep.sheep are frequently thought of as unintelligent animals. their flocking behavior and quickness to flee and panic can make shepherding a difficult endeavor for the uninitiated. despite these perceptions, a university of illinois monograph on sheep reported their intelligence to be just below that of pigs and on par with that of cattle.sheep can recognize individual human and ovine faces and remember them for years. in addition to long-term facial recognition of individuals, sheep can also differentiate emotional states through facial characteristics. if worked with patiently, sheep may learn their names, and many sheep are trained to be led by halter for showing and other purposes. sheep have also responded well to clicker training. sheep have been used as pack animals; tibetan nomads distribute baggage equally throughout a flock as it is herded between living sites.it has been reported that some sheep have apparently shown problem-solving abilities; a flock in west yorkshire, england allegedly found a way to get over cattle grids by rolling on their backs, although documentation of this has relied on anecdotal accounts.sounds made by domestic sheep include bleats, grunts, rumbles and snorts.   bleating   the bleats of individual sheep are distinctive, enabling the ewe and her lambs to recognize each others vocalizations.  vocal communication between lambs and their dam declines to a very low level within several weeks after parturition.  a variety of bleats may be heard, depending on sheep age and circumstances. apart from contact communication, bleating may signal distress, frustration or impatience; however, sheep are usually silent when in pain.  isolation commonly prompts bleating by sheep.  pregnant ewes may grunt when in labor.  rumbling sounds are made by the ram during courting;  somewhat similar rumbling sounds may be made by the ewe, especially when with her neonate lambs.  a snort  and is often elicited from startled sheep.in sheep breeds lacking facial wool, the visual field is wide. in 10 sheep  in some breeds, unshorn facial wool can limit the visual field; in some individuals, this may be enough to cause ""wool blindness"". in 60 merinos, visual fields ranged from 219.169.90 months. ewes have estrus cycles about every 17 days, during which they emit a scent and indicate readiness through physical displays towards rams. a minority of rams  and a small number of the females that were accompanied by a male fetus in utero are freemartins in feral sheep, rams may fight during the rut to determine which individuals may mate with ewes. rams, especially unfamiliar ones, will also fight outside the breeding period to establish dominance; rams can kill one another if allowed to mix freely. during the rut, even usually friendly rams may become aggressive towards humans due to increases in their hormone levels.after mating, sheep have a gestation period of about five months, and normal labor takes one to three hours. although some breeds regularly throw larger litters of lambs, most produce single or twin lambs. during or soon after labor, ewes and lambs may be confined to small lambing jugs, small pens designed to aid both careful observation of ewes and to cement the bond between them and their lambs.ovine obstetrics can be problematic. by selectively breeding ewes that produce multiple offspring with higher birth weights for generations, sheep producers have inadvertently caused some domestic sheep to have difficulty lambing; balancing ease of lambing with high productivity is one of the dilemmas of sheep breeding. in the case of any such problems, those present at lambing may assist the ewe by extracting or repositioning lambs. after the birth, ewes ideally break the amniotic sac  most lambs will begin standing within an hour of birth. in normal situations, lambs nurse after standing, receiving vital colostrum milk. lambs that either fail to nurse or are rejected by the ewe require help to survive, such as bottle-feeding or fostering by another ewe.most lambs begin life being born outdoors. after lambs are several weeks old, lamb marking  vaccinations are usually carried out at this point as well. ear tags with numbers are attached, or ear marks are applied, for ease of later identification of sheep. docking and castration are commonly done after 24 hours  the first course of vaccinations  ewes are often revaccinated annually about 3 weeks before lambing, to provide high antibody concentrations in colostrum during the first several hours after lambing. ram lambs that will either be slaughtered or separated from ewes before sexual maturity are not usually castrated. objections to all these procedures have been raised by animal rights groups, but farmers defend them by saying they save money, and inflict only temporary pain.sheep may fall victim to poisons, infectious diseases, and physical injuries. as a prey species, a sheeps system is adapted to hide the obvious signs of illness, to prevent being targeted by predators. however, some signs of ill health are obvious, with sick sheep eating little, vocalizing excessively, and being generally listless. throughout history, much of the money and labor of sheep husbandry has aimed to prevent sheep ailments. historically, shepherds often created remedies by experimentation on the farm. in some developed countries, including the united states, sheep lack the economic importance for drug companies to perform expensive clinical trials required to approve more than a relatively limited number of drugs for ovine use. however, extra-label drug use in sheep production is permitted in many jurisdictions, subject to certain restrictions.  in the us, for example, regulations governing extra-label drug use in animals are found in 21 cfr  in the 20th and 21st centuries, a minority of sheep owners have turned to alternative treatments such as homeopathy, herbalism and even traditional chinese medicine to treat sheep veterinary problems. despite some favorable anecdotal evidence, the effectiveness of alternative veterinary medicine has been met with skepticism in scientific journals. the need for traditional anti-parasite drugs and antibiotics is widespread, and is the main impediment to certified organic farming with sheep.many breeders take a variety of preventive measures to ward off problems. the first is to ensure all sheep are healthy when purchased. many buyers avoid outlets known to be clearing houses for animals culled from healthy flocks as either sick or simply inferior. this can also mean maintaining a closed flock, and quarantining new sheep for a month. two fundamental preventive programs are maintaining good nutrition and reducing stress in the sheep. restraint, isolation, loud noises, novel situations, pain, heat, extreme cold, fatigue and other stressors can lead to secretion of cortisol, a stress hormone, in amounts that may indicate welfare problems.  excessive stress can compromise the immune system.  ""shipping fever""   pain, fear and several other stressors can cause secretion of epinephrine   because of such issues, low-stress handling is essential in sheep management.   avoiding poisoning is also important; common poisons are pesticide sprays, inorganic fertilizer, motor oil, as well as radiator coolant containing ethylene glycol.common forms of preventive medication for sheep are vaccinations and treatments for parasites. both external and internal parasites are the most prevalent malady in sheep, and are either fatal, or reduce the productivity of flocks. worms are the most common internal parasites. they are ingested during grazing, incubate within the sheep, and are expelled through the digestive system   external sheep parasites include: lice   nose bots are fly larvae that inhabit a sheeps sinuses, causing breathing difficulties and discomfort. common signs are a discharge from the nasal passage, sneezing, and frantic movement such as head shaking. external parasites may be controlled through the use of backliners, sprays or immersive sheep dips.a wide array of bacterial and viral diseases affect sheep. diseases of the hoof, such as foot rot and foot scald may occur, and are treated with footbaths and other remedies. foot rot is present in over 97% of flocks in the uk. these painful conditions cause lameness and hinder feeding. ovine johnes disease is a wasting disease that affects young sheep. bluetongue disease is an insect-borne illness causing fever and inflammation of the mucous membranes. ovine rinderpest  or secondary photosensitization. tetanus can also afflict sheep through wounds from shearing, docking, castration, or vaccination. the organism also can be introduced into the reproductive tract by unsanitary humans who assist ewes during lambing.a few sheep conditions are transmissible to humans. orf of the 600,300 sheep lost to the us economy in 2004, 37.3% were lost to predators, while 26.5% were lost to some form of disease. poisoning accounted for 1.7% of non-productive deaths.other than parasites and disease, predation is a threat to sheep and the profitability of sheep raising. sheep have little ability to defend themselves, compared with other species kept as livestock. even if sheep survive an attack, they may die from their injuries or simply from panic. however, the impact of predation varies dramatically with region. in africa, australia, the americas, and parts of europe and asia predators are a serious problem. in the united states, for instance, over one third of sheep deaths in 2004 were caused by predation. in contrast, other nations are virtually devoid of sheep predators, particularly islands known for extensive sheep husbandry. worldwide, canids0th century wool prices began to fall dramatically as the result of the popularity and cheap prices for synthetic fabrics. for many sheep owners, the cost of shearing is greater than the possible profit from the fleece, making subsisting on wool production alone practically impossible without farm subsidies. fleeces are used as material in making alternative products such as wool insulation. in the 21st century, the sale of meat is the most profitable enterprise in the sheep industry, even though far less sheep meat is consumed than chicken, pork or beef.sheepskin is likewise used for making clothes, footwear, rugs, and other products. byproducts from the slaughter of sheep are also of value: sheep tallow can be used in candle and soap making, sheep bone and cartilage has been used to furnish carved items such as dice and buttons as well as rendered glue and gelatin. sheep intestine can be formed into sausage casings, and lamb intestine has been formed into surgical sutures, as well as strings for musical instruments and tennis rackets. sheep droppings, which are high in cellulose, have even been sterilized and mixed with traditional pulp materials to make paper. of all sheep byproducts, perhaps the most valuable is lanolin: the waterproof, fatty substance found naturally in sheeps wool and used as a base for innumerable cosmetics and other products.some farmers who keep sheep also make a profit from live sheep. providing lambs for youth programs such as 4-h and competition at agricultural shows is often a dependable avenue for the sale of sheep. farmers may also choose to focus on a particular breed of sheep in order to sell registered purebred animals, as well as provide a ram rental service for breeding. a new option for deriving profit from live sheep is the rental of flocks for grazing; these ""mowing services"" are hired in order to keep unwanted vegetation down in public spaces and to lessen fire hazard.despite the falling demand and price for sheep products in many markets, sheep have distinct economic advantages when compared with other livestock. they do not require expensive housing, such as that used in the intensive farming of chickens or pigs. they are an efficient use of land; roughly six sheep can be kept on the amount that would suffice for a single cow or horse. sheep can also consume plants, such as noxious weeds, that most other animals will not touch, and produce more young at a faster rate. also, in contrast to most livestock species, the cost of raising sheep is not necessarily tied to the price of feed crops such as grain, soybeans and corn. combined with the  lower cost of quality sheep, all these factors combine to equal a lower overhead for sheep producers, thus entailing a higher profitability potential for the small farmer. sheep are especially beneficial for independent producers, including family farms with limited resources, as the sheep industry is one of the few types of animal agriculture that has not been vertically integrated by agribusiness. however, small flocks, from 10 to 50 ewes, often are not profitable because they tend to be poorly managed. the primary reason is that mechanization is not feasible, so return per hour of labor is not maximized. small farm flocks generally are used simply to control weeds on irrigation ditches or maintained as a hobby.sheep meat and milk were one of the earliest staple proteins consumed by human civilization after the transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture.  sheep meat prepared for food is known as either mutton or lamb, and approximately 540 million sheep are slaughtered each year for meat worldwide. ""mutton"" is derived from the old french moton, which was the word for sheep used by the anglo-norman rulers of much of the british isles in the middle ages. this became the name for sheep meat in english, while the old english word sceap was kept for the live animal. throughout modern history, ""mutton"" has been limited to the meat of mature sheep usually at least two years of age; ""lamb"" is used for that of immature sheep less than a year.in the 21st century, the nations with the highest consumption of sheep meat are the arab states of the persian gulf, new zealand, australia, greece, uruguay, the united kingdom and ireland. these countries eat 14008, the sheep genome has not been fully sequenced, although a detailed genetic map has been published, and a draft version of the complete genome produced by assembling sheep dna sequences using information given by the genomes of other mammals. in 2012, a transgenic sheep named ""peng peng"" was cloned by chinese scientists, who spliced his genes with that of a roundworm in the study of natural selection, the population of soay sheep that remain on the island of hirta have been used to explore the relation of body size and coloration to reproductive success. soay sheep come in several colors, and researchers investigated why the larger, darker sheep were in decline; this occurrence contradicted the rule of thumb that larger members of a population tend to be more successful reproductively. the feral soays on hirta are especially useful subjects because they are isolated.sheep are one of the few animals where the molecular basis of the diversity of male sexual preferences has been examined. however, this research has been controversial, and much publicity has been produced by a study at the oregon health and science university that investigated the mechanisms that produce homosexuality in rams. organizations such as peta campaigned against the study, accusing scientists of trying to cure homosexuality in the sheep. ohsu and the involved scientists vehemently denied such accusations.domestic sheep are sometimes used in medical research, particularly for researching cardiovascular physiology, in areas such as hypertension and heart failure. pregnant sheep are also a useful model for human pregnancy, and have been used to investigate the effects on fetal development of malnutrition and hypoxia. in behavioral sciences, sheep have been used in isolated cases for the study of facial recognition, as their mental process of recognition is qualitatively similar to humans.sheep have had a strong presence in many cultures, especially in areas where they form the most common type of livestock. in the english language, to call someone a sheep or ovine may allude that they are timid and easily led. in contradiction to this image, male sheep are often used as symbols of virility and power; the logos of the los angeles rams football team and the dodge ram pickup truck allude to males of the bighorn sheep, ovis canadensis.counting sheep is popularly said to be an aid to sleep, and some ancient systems of counting sheep persist today. sheep also enter in colloquial sayings and idiom frequently with such phrases as ""black sheep"". to call an individual a black sheep implies that they are an odd or disreputable member of a group. this usage derives from the recessive trait that causes an occasional black lamb to be born into an entirely white flock. these black sheep were considered undesirable by shepherds, as black wool is not as commercially viable as white wool. citizens who accept overbearing governments have been referred to by the portmanteau neologism of sheeple. somewhat differently, the adjective ""sheepish"" is also used to describe embarrassment.in british heraldry, sheep appear in the form of rams, sheep proper and lambs. these are distinguished by the ram being depicted with horns and a tail, the sheep with neither and the lamb with its tail only. a further variant of the lamb, termed the paschal lamb, is depicted as carrying a christian cross and with a halo over its head. rams heads, portrayed without a neck and facing the viewer, are also found in british armories. the fleece, depicted as an entire sheepskin carried by a ring around its midsection, originally became known through its use in the arms of the order of the golden fleece and was later adopted by towns and individuals with connections to the wool industry.in antiquity, symbolism involving sheep cropped up in religions in the ancient near east, the mideast, and the mediterranean area: -year cycle of in the chinese zodiac, related to the chinese calendar. in mongolia, shagai are an ancient form of dice made from the cuboid bones of sheep that are often used for fortunetelling purposes.sheep play an important role in all the abrahamic faiths; abraham, isaac, jacob, moses, king david and the islamic prophet muhammad were all shepherds. according to the biblical story of the binding of isaac, a ram is sacrificed as a substitute for isaac after an angel stays abrahams hand  sheep are occasionally sacrificed to commemorate important secular events in islamic cultures. greeks and romans sacrificed sheep regularly in religious practice, and judaism once sacrificed sheep as a korban  ovine symbols\x80\x94still find a presence in modern judaic traditions.collectively, followers of christianity are often referred to as a flock, with christ as the good shepherd, and sheep are an element in the christian iconography of the birth of jesus. some christian saints are considered patrons of shepherds, and even of sheep themselves. christ is also portrayed as the sacrificial lamb of god (agnus dei and easter celebrations in greece and romania traditionally feature a meal of paschal lamb. a church leader is often called the pastor, which is derived from the latin word for shepherd. in many western christian traditions bishops carry a staff, which also serves as a symbol of the episcopal office, known as a crosier, which is modeled on the shepherds crook.sheep are key symbols in fables and nursery rhymes like the wolf in sheeps clothing, little bo peep, baa, baa, black sheep, and mary had a little lamb; novels such as george orwells animal farm and haruki murakamis a wild sheep chase; songs such as bachs sheep may safely graze (schafe k\xc3\xb6nnen sicher weiden and pink floyds sheep, and poems like william blakes ""the lamb"".",1,0
"field research, field studies, or fieldwork is the collection of raw data outside a laboratory, library, or workplace setting. the approaches and methods used in field research vary across disciplines. for example, biologists who conduct field research may simply observe animals interacting with their environments, whereas social scientists conducting field research may interview or observe people in their natural environments to learn their languages, folklore, and social structures.field research involves a range of well-defined, although variable, methods: informal interviews,

may be conducted by zoologists such as jane goodall. radcliff-brown  and malinowski  were early cultural anthropologists who set the models for future work.business use of field research is an applied form of anthropology and is as likely to be advised by sociologists or statisticians in the case of surveys.consumer marketing field research is the primary marketing technique used by businesses to research their target market.the quality of results obtained from field research depends on the data gathered in the field. the data in turn, depend upon the field worker, his or her level of involvement, and ability to see and visualize things that other individuals visiting the area of study may fail to notice. the more open researchers are to new ideas, concepts, and things which they may not have seen in their own culture, the better will be the absorption of those ideas. better grasping of such material means a better understanding of the forces of culture operating in the area and the ways they modify the lives of the people under study. social scientists anthropological fieldwork uses an array of methods and approaches that include, but are not limited to: participant observation, structured and unstructured interviews, archival research, collecting demographic information from the community the anthropologist is studying, and data analysis. traditional participant observation is usually undertaken over an extended period of time, ranging from several months to many years, and even generations. an extended research time period means that the researcher is able to obtain more detailed and accurate information about the individuals, community, and/or population under study. observable details  and remains an important component of many research projects. in other disciplines of the earth and atmospheric sciences, field research refers to field experiments  in a recent interview oliver williamson and elinor ostrom discuss the importance of examining institutional contexts when performing economic analyses. both ostrom and williamson agree that ""top-down"" panaceas or ""cookie cutter"" approaches to policy problems dont work.  they believe that policymakers need to give local people a chance to shape the systems used to allocate resources and resolve disputes.  sometimes, ostrom points out, local solutions can be the most efficient and effective options. this is a point of view that fits very well with anthropological research, which has for some time shown us the logic of local systems of knowledge \x80\x94 and the damage that can be done when ""solutions"" to problems are imposed from outside or above without adequate consultation. elinor ostrom, for example, combines field case studies and experimental lab work in her research. using this combination, she contested longstanding assumptions about the possibility that groups of people could cooperate to solve common pool problems edward j. nell argued in 1998 that there are two types of field research in economics. one kind can give us a carefully drawn picture of institutions and practices, general in that it applies to all activities of a certain kind of particular society or social setting, but still specialized to that society or setting. although institutions and practices are intangibles, such a picture will be objective, a matter of fact, independent of the state of mind of the particular agents reported on. approaching the economy from a different angle, another kind of fieldwork can give us a picture of the state of mind of economic agents in public health, the use of the term field research refers to epidemiology or the study of epidemics through the gathering of data about the epidemic  the study addresses the reproduction of social inequality among low-income, male teenagers. the researcher spent time studying two groups of teenagers in a housing project in a northeastern city of the united states. the study concludes that three different levels of analysis play their part in the reproduction of social inequality: the individual, the cultural, and the structural.",1,0
"a tropical cyclone is a rapidly rotating storm system characterized by a low-pressure center, a closed low-level atmospheric circulation, strong winds, and a spiral arrangement of thunderstorms that produce heavy rain or squalls. depending on its location and strength, a tropical cyclone is referred to by different names, including hurricane  typhoon  a hurricane is a tropical cyclone that occurs in the atlantic ocean and northeastern pacific ocean, and a typhoon occurs in the northwestern pacific ocean; in the south pacific or indian ocean, comparable storms are referred to simply as ""tropical cyclones"" or ""severe cyclonic storms"".""tropical"" refers to the geographical origin of these systems, which form almost exclusively over tropical seas. ""cyclone"" refers to their winds moving in a circle, whirling round their central clear eye, with their winds blowing counterclockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern hemisphere. the opposite direction of circulation is due to the coriolis effect. tropical cyclones typically form over large bodies of relatively warm water. they derive their energy through the evaporation of water from the ocean surface, which ultimately recondenses into clouds and rain when moist air rises and cools to saturation. this energy source differs from that of mid-latitude cyclonic storms, such as noreasters and european windstorms, which are fueled primarily by horizontal temperature contrasts. tropical cyclones are typically between 100 and 2,0004 hours. for rapid intensification to occur, several conditions must be in place. water temperatures must be extremely high there are a variety of metrics commonly used to measure storm size. the most common metrics include the radius of maximum wind, the radius of 34-knot wind  an additional metric is the radius at which the cyclones relative vorticity field decreases to 15 s1.on earth, tropical cyclones span a large range of sizes, from 100,000 kilometres  if the radius of outermost closed isobar is less than two degrees of latitude  observations indicate that size is only weakly correlated to variables such as storm intensity size plays an important role in modulating damage caused by a storm. all else equal, a larger storm will impact a larger area for a longer period of time. additionally, a larger near-surface wind field can generate higher storm surge due to the combination of longer wind fetch, longer duration, and enhanced wave setup.the upper circulation of strong hurricanes extends into the tropopause of the atmosphere, which at low latitudes is 15,000k{\\displaystyle \\delta k=k_{s}^{*}-k}, where ks00 k, corresponding to a carnot efficiency of 6.50001 and 2004, respectively.the movement of a tropical cyclone environmental steering is the dominant term. conceptually, it represents the movement of the storm due to prevailing winds and other wider environmental conditions, similar to ""leaves carried along by a stream"". physically, the winds, or flow field, in the vicinity of a tropical cyclone may be treated as having two parts: the flow associated with the storm itself, and the large-scale background flow of the environment in which the storm takes place. in this way, tropical cyclone motion may be represented to first-order simply as advection of the storm by the local environmental flow. this environmental flow is termed the ""steering flow"".climatologically, tropical cyclones are steered primarily westward by the east-to-west trade winds on the equatorial side of the subtropical ridge006.the landfall of a tropical cyclone occurs when a storms surface center  storm conditions may be experienced on the coast and inland hours before landfall; in fact, a tropical cyclone can launch its strongest winds over land, yet not make landfall. noaa uses the term ""direct hit"" to describe when a location most tropical cyclones form on the side of the subtropical ridge closer to the equator, then move poleward past the ridge axis before recurving into the main belt of the westerlies. when the subtropical ridge position shifts due to el ni6.5000s have given rise to the hypothesis that large amounts of dust reduce the strength of tropical cyclones.in the 1960s and 1970s, the united states government attempted to weaken hurricanes through project stormfury by seeding selected storms with silver iodide. it was thought that the seeding would cause supercooled water in the outer rainbands to freeze, causing the inner eyewall to collapse and thus reducing the winds. the winds of hurricane debbie005 hurricane season. a similar mission was also completed successfully in the western pacific ocean. this demonstrated a new way to probe the storms at low altitudes that human pilots seldom dare.because of the forces that affect tropical cyclone tracks, accurate track predictions depend on determining the position and strength of high- and low-pressure areas, and predicting how those areas will change during the life of a tropical system. the deep layer mean flow, or average wind through the depth of the troposphere, is considered the best tool in determining track direction and speed. if storms are significantly sheared, use of wind speed measurements at a lower altitude, such as at the 702,000013, causing widespread devastation in eastern visayas, and killing at least 6,300 people in the philippines alone. in 1982, the unnamed tropical depression that eventually became hurricane paul killed around 1,0005017 after making landfall in texas as a low-end category 4 hurricane. hurricane katrina is estimated as the second-costliest tropical cyclone worldwide, causing $81.2005. hurricane maria is the third most destructive tropical cyclone in u.s. history, with damage totaling $91.61 was the most powerful storm to strike hawaii in recorded history, hitting kauai as a category004, cyclone gafilo struck northeastern madagascar as a powerful cyclone, killing 74, affecting more than 200,000 and becoming the worst cyclone to affect the nation for more than 2005 knots the world meteorological organization established barrow island  on april 10, 1996, during severe tropical cyclone olivia.in addition to being the most intense tropical cyclone on record based on pressure, tip is the largest cyclone on record, with tropical storm-force winds 2,170 kilometres hurricane john is the longest-lasting tropical cyclone on record, lasting 3150.5 major hurricanes per year and lasting 100 per year.although more common since 1995, few above-normal hurricane seasons occurred during 19706 to 1960, including many major new england hurricanes. twenty-one atlantic tropical storms formed in 1933, a record only recently exceeded in 2005, which saw 28 storms. tropical hurricanes occurred infrequently during the seasons of 19005; however, many intense storms formed during 18701 storm that made a direct hit on new york city. some historical weather experts say these storms may have been as high as category 4 in strength.these active hurricane seasons predated satellite coverage of the atlantic basin. before the satellite era began in 1960, tropical storms or hurricanes went undetected unless a reconnaissance aircraft encountered one, a ship reported a voyage through the storm, or a storm hit land in a populated area.proxy records based on paleotempestological research have revealed that major hurricane activity along the gulf of mexico coast varies on timescales of centuries to millennia. few major hurricanes struck the gulf coast during 300000 14c years bp, and a change towards more humid conditions in the great plains during the late-holocene as more moisture was pumped up the mississippi valley through the gulf coast. preliminary data from the northern atlantic coast seem to support the azores high hypothesis. a 3000-year proxy record from a coastal lake in cape cod suggests that hurricane activity increased significantly during the past 500017, there was a global increase in the proportion of tropical cyclones of category 3 and higher on the saffir019 study indicates that climate change has been driving the observed trend of rapid intensification of tropical cyclones in the atlantic basin. rapidly intensifying cyclones are hard to forecast and therefore pose additional risk to coastal communities.there is currently no consensus on how climate change will affect the overall frequency of tropical cyclones. a majority of climate models show a decreased frequency in future projections. for instance, a 2020 paper comparing nine high-resolution climate models found robust decreases in frequency in the southern indian ocean and the southern hemisphere more generally, while finding mixed signals for northern hemisphere tropical cyclones. observations have shown little change in the overall frequency of tropical cyclones worldwide.there has been a poleward expansion of the latitude at which the maximum intensity of tropical cyclones occurs, which may be associated with climate change. in the north pacific, there may also have been an eastward expansion. between 1949 and 2016, there was a slowdown in tropical cyclone translation speeds. it is unclear still to what extent this can be attributed to climate change: climate models do not all show this feature.warmer air can hold more water vapor: the theoretical maximum water vapor content is given by the clausius019 review paper show a future increase of rainfall rates. additional sea level rise will increase storm surge levels. it is plausible that extreme wind waves see an increase as a consequence of changes in tropical cyclones, further exacerbating storm surge dangers to coastal communities. a 2017 study looked at compounding effects from floods, storm surge, and terrestrial flooding in addition to tropical cyclones, there are two other classes of cyclones within the spectrum of cyclone types. these kinds of cyclones, known as extratropical cyclones and subtropical cyclones, can be stages a tropical cyclone passes through during its formation or dissipation. an extratropical cyclone is a storm that derives energy from horizontal temperature differences, which are typical in higher latitudes. a tropical cyclone can become extratropical as it moves toward higher latitudes if its energy source changes from heat released by condensation to differences in temperature between air masses; although not as frequently, an extratropical cyclone can transform into a subtropical storm, and from there into a tropical cyclone. from space, extratropical storms have a characteristic ""comma-shaped"" cloud pattern. extratropical cyclones can also be dangerous when their low-pressure centers cause powerful winds and high seas.a subtropical cyclone is a weather system that has some characteristics of a tropical cyclone and some characteristics of an extratropical cyclone. they can form in a wide band of latitudes, from the equator to 50004 film the day after tomorrow includes several mentions of actual tropical cyclones and features fantastical ""hurricane-like"", albeit non-tropical, arctic storms.",1,0
"a boat is a watercraft of a large range of types and sizes, but generally smaller than a ship, which is distinguished by its larger size, shape, cargo or passenger capacity, or its ability to carry boats.small boats are typically found on inland waterways such as rivers and lakes, or in protected coastal areas. however, some boats, such as the whaleboat, were intended for use in an offshore environment. in modern naval terms, a boat is a vessel small enough to be carried aboard a ship.  anomalous definitions exist, as lake freighters 1,000 feet   circumstantial evidence, such as the early settlement of australia over 40,000 years ago, findings in crete dated 130,000 years ago, and in flores dated to 900,000 years ago, suggest that boats have been used since prehistoric times. the earliest boats are thought to have been dugouts, and the oldest boats found by archaeological excavation date from around 7,00000 and 7600 bc. this canoe is exhibited in the drents museum in assen, netherlands. other very old dugout boats have also been recovered.rafts have operated for at least 8,000 years.a 7,000-year-old seagoing reed boat has been found in kuwait.boats were used between 4000 and 3000 bc in sumer, ancient egypt and in the indian ocean.boats played an important role in the commerce between the indus valley civilization and mesopotamia. evidence of varying models of boats has also been discovered at various indus valley archaeological sites.uru craft originate in beypore, a village in south calicut, kerala, in southwestern india. this type of mammoth wooden ship was constructed solely of teak, with a transport capacity of 400 tonnes. the ancient arabs and greeks used such boats as trading vessels.the historians herodotus, pliny the elder and strabo record the use of boats for commerce, travel, and military purposes.boats can be categorized into three main types:the hull is the main, and in some cases only, structural component of a boat.  it provides both capacity and buoyancy. the keel is a boats ""backbone"", a lengthwise structural member to which the perpendicular frames are fixed. on most boats a deck covers the hull, in part or whole. while a ship often has several decks, a boat is unlikely to have more than one. above the deck are often lifelines connected to stanchions, bulwarks perhaps topped by gunnels, or some combination of the two. a cabin may protrude above the deck forward, aft, along the centerline, or covering much of the length of the boat. vertical structures dividing the internal spaces are known as bulkheads.the forward end of a boat is called the bow, the aft end the stern. facing forward the right side is referred to as starboard and the left side as port.until the mid-19th century most boats were made of natural materials, primarily wood, although reed, bark and animal skins were also used. early boats include the bound-reed style of boat seen in ancient egypt, the birch bark canoe, the animal hide-covered kayak and coracle and the dugout canoe made from a single log.by the mid-19th century, many boats had been built with iron or steel frames but still planked in wood. in 1855 ferro-cement boat construction was patented by the french, who coined the name ""ferciment"". this is a system by which a steel or iron wire framework is built in the shape of a boats hull and covered over with cement. reinforced with bulkheads and other internal structure it is strong but heavy, easily repaired, and, if sealed properly, will not leak or corrode.as the forests of britain and europe continued to be over-harvested to supply the keels of larger wooden boats, and the bessemer process  but it wasnt until the mid-20th century that aluminium gained widespread popularity. though much more expensive than steel, aluminum alloys exist that do not corrode in salt water, allowing a similar load carrying capacity to steel at much less weight.around the mid-1960s, boats made of fiberglass  or foam.cold moulding is a modern construction method, using wood as the structural component. in cold moulding very thin strips of wood are layered over a form. each layer is coated with resin, followed by another directionally alternating layer laid on top. subsequent layers may be stapled or otherwise mechanically fastened to the previous, or weighted or vacuum bagged to provide compression and stabilization until the resin sets.the most common means of boat propulsion are as follows:a boat displaces its weight in water, regardless whether it is made of wood, steel, fiberglass, or even concrete.  if weight is added to the boat, the volume of the hull drawn below the waterline will increase to keep the balance above and below the surface equal.  boats have a natural or designed level of buoyancy.  exceeding it will cause the boat first to ride lower in the water, second to take on water more readily than when properly loaded, and ultimately, if overloaded by any combination of structure, cargo, and water, sink.as commercial vessels must be correctly loaded to be safe, and as the sea becomes less buoyant in brackish areas such as the baltic, the plimsoll line was introduced to prevent overloading.since 1998 all new leisure boats and barges built in europe between 2.5m and 24m must comply with the eus recreational craft directive a boat on the ganges riverbabur crossing

"the onion  and chinese onion.this genus also contains several other species variously referred to as onions and cultivated for food, such as the japanese bunching onion  the onion is most frequently a biennial or a perennial plant, but is usually treated as an annual and harvested in its first growing season.the onion plant has a fan of hollow, bluish-green leaves and its bulb at the base of the plant begins to swell when a certain day-length is reached. the bulbs are composed of shortened, compressed, underground stems surrounded by fleshy modified scale  or common onion, is the most widely cultivated species of the genus allium. it was first officially described by carl linnaeus in his 1753 work species plantarum. a number of synonyms have appeared in its taxonomic history:a. cepa is known exclusively from cultivation, but related wild species occur in central asia. the most closely related species include a. vavilovii  however, zohary and hopf state that ""there are doubts whether the a.5 different compounds identified representing 10% of total flavonoid content.onion polyphenols are under basic research to determine their possible biological properties in humans.some people suffer from allergic reactions after handling onions. symptoms can include contact dermatitis, intense itching, rhinoconjunctivitis, blurred vision, bronchial asthma, sweating, and anaphylaxis. allergic reactions may not occur when eating cooked onions, possibly due to the denaturing of the proteins from cooking.freshly cut onions often cause a stinging sensation in the eyes of people nearby, and often uncontrollable tears. this is caused by the release of a volatile liquid, syn-propanethial-s-oxide and its aerosol, which stimulates nerves in the eye. this gas is produced by a chain of reactions which serve as a defence mechanism: chopping an onion causes damage to cells which releases enzymes called alliinases. these break down amino acid sulfoxides and generate sulfenic acids. a specific sulfenic acid, 1-propenesulfenic acid, is rapidly acted on by a second enzyme, the lacrimatory factor synthase, producing the syn-propanethial-s-oxide. this gas diffuses through the air and soon reaches the eyes, where it activates sensory neurons. lacrimal glands produce tears to dilute and flush out the irritant.eye irritation can be avoided by cutting onions under running water or submerged in a basin of water. leaving the root end intact also reduces irritation as the onion base has a higher concentration of sulphur compounds than the rest of the bulb. refrigerating the onions before use reduces the enzyme reaction rate and using a fan can blow the gas away from the eyes. the more often one chops onions, the less one experiences eye irritation.the amount of sulfenic acids and lacrimal factor released and the irritation effect differs among allium species. in 2008, the new zealand institute for crop and food research created ""no tears"" onions by genetic modification to prevent the synthesis of lachrymatory factor synthase in onions. one study suggests that consumers prefer the flavor of onions with lower lfs content. however, since the lfs-silencing process involves reducing sulfur ingestion by the plant, it has also been suggested that lfs onions are inferior in flavor. a method for efficiently differentiating lfs and lfs+ onions has been developed based on mass spectrometry, with potential application in high-volume production; gas chromatography is also used to measure lachrymatory factor in onions. in early 2018, bayer released the first crop yield of commercially available lfs-silenced onions under the name ""sunions."" they were the product of 30 years of cross-breeding; genetic modification was not employed.guinea hen weed and honey garlic contain a similar lachrymatory factor. synthetic onion lachrymatory factor has been used in a study related to tear production, and has been proposed as a nonlethal deterrent against thieves and intruders.onions are best cultivated in fertile soils that are well-drained. sandy loams are good as they are low in sulphur, while clayey soils usually have a high sulphur content and produce pungent bulbs. onions require a high level of nutrients in the soil. phosphorus is often present in sufficient quantities, but may be applied before planting because of its low level of availability in cold soils. nitrogen and potash can be applied at regular intervals during the growing season, the last application of nitrogen being at least four weeks before harvesting. bulbing onions are day-length sensitive; their bulbs begin growing only after the number of daylight hours has surpassed some minimal quantity. most traditional european onions are referred to as ""long-day"" onions, producing bulbs only after 14 hours or more of daylight occurs. southern european and north african varieties are often known as ""intermediate-day"" types, requiring only 12 hours of daylight to stimulate bulb formation. onions are a cool-weather crop and can be grown in usda zones 3 to 18 weeks. the bulbs can be gathered when needed to eat fresh, but if they will be stored, they are harvested after the leaves have died back naturally. in dry weather, they can be left on the surface of the soil for a few days for drying, then placed in nets, roped into strings, or laid in layers in shallow boxes. they are stored effectively in a well-ventilated, cool place.onions suffer from a number of plant disorders. the most serious for the home gardener are likely to be the onion fly, stem and bulb eelworm, white rot, and neck rot. diseases affecting the foliage include rust and smut, downy mildew, and white tip disease. the bulbs may be affected by splitting, white rot, and neck rot. shanking is a condition in which the central leaves turn yellow and the inner part of the bulb collapses into an unpleasant-smelling slime. most of these disorders are best treated by removing and burning affected plants. the larvae of the onion leaf miner or leek moth the onion fly the onion eelworm white rot of onions, leeks, and garlic is caused by the soil-borne fungus sclerotium cepivorum. as the roots rot, the foliage turns yellow and wilts. the bases of the bulbs are attacked and become covered by a fluffy white mass of mycelia, which later produces small, globular black structures called sclerotia. these resting structures remain in the soil to reinfect a future crop. no cure for this fungal disease exists, so affected plants should be removed and destroyed and the ground used for unrelated crops in subsequent years.neck rot is a fungal disease affecting onions in storage. it is caused by botrytis allii, which attacks the neck and upper parts of the bulb, causing a grey mould to develop. the symptoms often first occur where the bulb has been damaged and spread downwards in the affected scales. large quantities of spores are produced and crust-like sclerotia may also develop. in time, a dry rot sets in and the bulb becomes a dry, mummified structure. this disease may be present throughout the growing period, but only manifests itself when the bulb is in storage. antifungal seed dressings are available and the disease can be minimised by preventing physical damage to the bulbs at harvesting, careful drying and curing of the mature onions, and correct storage in a cool, dry place with plenty of circulating air.in 2018, world production of onions and shallots cooking onions and sweet onions are better stored at room temperature, optimally in a single layer, in mesh bags in a dry, cool, dark, well-ventilated location. in this environment, cooking onions have a shelf life of three to four weeks and sweet onions one to two weeks. cooking onions will absorb odours from apples and pears. also, they draw moisture from vegetables with which they are stored which may cause them to decay.sweet onions have a greater water and sugar content than cooking onions. this makes them sweeter and milder tasting, but reduces their shelf life. sweet onions can be stored refrigerated; they have a shelf life of around 1 month. irrespective of type, any cut pieces of onion are best tightly wrapped, stored away from other produce, and used within two to three days.most of the diversity within a. cepa occurs within this group, the most economically important allium crop. plants within this group form large single bulbs, and are grown from seed or seed-grown sets. the majority of cultivated varieties grown for dry bulbs, salad onions, and pickling onions belong to this group. the range of diversity found among these cultivars includes variation in photoperiod  common onions range from the pungent varieties used for dried soups and onion powder to the mild and hearty sweet onions, such as the vidalia from georgia, usa, or walla walla from washington that can be sliced and eaten raw on a sandwich.this group contains shallots and potato onions, also referred to as multiplier onions. the bulbs are smaller than those of common onions, and a single plant forms an aggregate cluster of several bulbs from a master. they are propagated almost exclusively from daughter bulbs, although reproduction from seed is possible. shallots are the most important subgroup within this group and comprise the only cultivars cultivated commercially. they form aggregate clusters of small, narrowly ovoid to pear-shaped bulbs. potato onions differ from shallots in forming larger bulbs with fewer bulbs per cluster, and having a flattened iitoi onion is a prolific multiplier onion cultivated in the baboquivari peak wilderness, arizona area. this small-bulb type has a shallot-like flavour and is easy to grow and ideal for hot, dry climates. bulbs are separated, and planted in the fall 1\xa0in apart. bulbs will multiply into clumps and can be harvested throughout the cooler months. tops die back in the heat of summer and may return with heavy rains; bulbs can remain in the ground or be harvested and stored in a cool dry place for planting in the fall. the plants rarely flower; propagation is by division.a number of hybrids are cultivated that have a. cepa parentage, such as the diploid tree onion or egyptian onion  it has been grown for centuries in japan and china for use as a salad onion.the triploid onion is a hybrid species with three sets of chromosomes, two sets from a. cepa and the third set from an unknown parent. various clones of the triploid onion are grown locally in different regions, such as ljutika in croatia, and pran, poonch, and srinagar in the india-kashmir region. pran is grown extensively in the northern indian provinces of jammu and kashmir. there are very small genetic differences between pran and the croatian clone ljutika, implying a monophyletic origin for this species.some authors have used the name a. cepa var. viviparum ",1,0
"health psychology is the study of psychological and behavioral processes in health, illness, and healthcare. it is concerned with understanding how psychological, behavioral, and cultural factors contribute to physical health and illness. psychological factors can affect health directly. for example, chronically occurring environmental stressors affecting the hypothalamic0th century by disciplines such as psychosomatic medicine and later behavioral medicine, but these were primarily branches of medicine, not psychology.united states  in 1969, william schofield prepared a report for the apa entitled the role of psychology in the delivery of health services. while there were exceptions, he found that the psychological research of the time frequently regarded mental health and physical health as separate, and devoted very little attention to psychologys impact upon physical health. one of the few psychologists working in this area at the time, schofield proposed new forms of education and training for future psychologists. the apa, responding to his proposal, in 1973 established a task force to consider how psychologists could health psychology began to emerge as a distinct discipline of psychology in the united states in the 1970s. in the mid-20th century there was a growing understanding in medicine of the effect of behavior on health. for example, the alameda county study, which began in the 1960s, showed that people who ate regular meals  in addition, psychologists and other scientists were discovering relationships between psychological processes and physiological ones. these discoveries include a better understanding of the impact of psychosocial stress on the cardiovascular and immune systems, and the early finding that the functioning of the immune system could be altered by learning.led by joseph matarazzo, in 1977, apa added a division devoted to health psychology. at the first divisional conference, matarazzo delivered a speech that played an important role in defining health psychology. he defined the new field in this way, ""health psychology is the aggregate of the specific educational, scientific and professional contributions of the discipline of psychology to the promotion and maintenance of health, the prevention and treatment of illness, the identification of diagnostic and etiologic correlates of health, illness and related dysfunction, and the analysis and improvement of the healthcare system and health policy formation."" in the 1980s, similar organizations were established elsewhere. in 1986, the bps established a division of health psychology. the european health psychology society was also established in 1986. similar organizations were established in other countries, including australia and japan. universities began to develop doctoral level training programs in health psychology. in the us, post-doctoral level health psychology training programs were established for individuals who completed a doctoral degree in clinical psychology.united kingdom  psychologists have been working in medical settings for many years  the bpss reconsideration of the role of the medical section prompted the emergence of health psychology as a distinct field. marie johnston and john weinman argued in a letter to the bps bulletin that there was a great need for a health psychology section. in december 1986 the section was established at the bps london conference, with marie johnston as chair. at the annual bps conference in 1993 a review of ""current trends in health psychology"" was organized, and a definition of health psychology as ""the study of psychological and behavioural processes in health, illness and healthcare"" was proposed.the health psychology section  became a special group in 1993 and was awarded divisional status within the uk  in 1997. the awarding of divisional status meant that the individual training needs and professional practice of health psychologists were recognized, and  members were able to obtain chartered status with the bps. the bps went on to regulate training and practice in health psychology until  the regulation of professional standards and qualifications was taken over by statutory registration with the health professions council in 2010.a number of relevant trends coincided with the emergence of health psychology, including:the emergence of academic /professional bodies to promote research and practice in health psychology was followed by the publication of a series of textbooks which began to lay out the interests of the discipline.health psychologists conduct research to identify behaviors and experiences that promote health, give rise to illness, and influence the effectiveness of health care. they also recommend ways to improve health care policy. health psychologists have worked on developing ways to reduce smoking and improve daily nutrition in order to promote health and prevent illness. they have also studied the association between illness and individual characteristics. for example, health psychology has found a relation between the personality characteristics of thrill seeking, impulsiveness, hostility/anger, emotional instability, and depression, on one hand, and high-risk driving, on the other.health psychology is also concerned with contextual factors, including economic, cultural, community, social, and lifestyle factors that influence health. physical addiction impedes smoking cessation. some research suggests that seductive advertising also contributes to psychological dependency on tobacco, although other research has found no relationship between media exposure and smoking in youth. ohp research indicates that people in jobs that combine little decision latitude with a high psychological workload are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease.  other research reveals a relation between unemployment and elevations in blood pressure. epidemiologic research documents a relation between social class and cardiovascular disease.health psychologists also aim to change health behaviors for the dual purpose of helping people stay healthy and helping patients adhere to disease treatment regimens  campaigns informed by health psychology have targeted tobacco use. those least able to afford tobacco products consume them most. tobacco provides individuals with a way of controlling aversive emotional states accompanying daily experiences of stress that characterize the lives of deprived and vulnerable individuals. practitioners emphasize education and effective communication as a part of illness prevention because many people do not recognize, or minimize, the risk of illness present in their lives. moreover, many individuals are often unable to apply their knowledge of health practices owing to everyday pressures and stresses. a common example of population-based attempts to motivate the smoking public to reduce its dependence on cigarettes is anti-smoking campaigns.health psychologists help to promote health and well-being by preventing illness. some illnesses can be more effectively treated if caught early. health psychologists have worked to understand why some people do not seek early screenings or immunizations, and have used that knowledge to develop ways to encourage people to have early health checks for illnesses such as cancer and heart disease. health psychologists are also finding ways to help people to avoid risky behaviors health psychologists also aim at educating health professionals, including physicians and nurses, in communicating effectively with patients in ways that overcome barriers to understanding, remembering, and implementing effective strategies for reducing exposures to risk factors and making health-enhancing behavior changes.there is also evidence from ohp that stress-reduction interventions at the workplace can be effective. for example, kompier and his colleagues have shown that a number of interventions aimed at reducing stress in bus drivers has had beneficial effects for employees and bus companies.health psychologists investigate how disease affects individuals psychological well-being. an individual who becomes seriously ill or injured faces many different practical stressors. these stressors include problems meeting medical and other bills, problems obtaining proper care when home from the hospital, obstacles to caring for dependents, the experience of having ones sense of self-reliance compromised, gaining a new, unwanted identity as that of a sick person, and so on. these stressors can lead to depression, reduced self-esteem, etc.health psychology also concerns itself with bettering the lives of individuals with terminal illness. when there is little hope of recovery, health psychologist therapists can improve the quality of life of the patient by helping the patient recover at least some of his or her psychological well-being. health psychologists are also concerned with providing therapeutic services for the bereaved.critical health psychologists explore how health policy can influence inequities, inequalities and social injustice. these avenues of research expand the scope of health psychology beyond the level of individual health to an examination of the social and economic determinants of health both within and between regions and nations. the individualism of mainstream health psychology has been critiqued and deconstructed by critical health psychologists using qualitative methods that zero in on the health experience.like psychologists in the other main psychology disciplines, health psychologists have advanced knowledge of research methods. health psychologists apply this knowledge to conduct research on a variety of questions. for example, health psychologists carry out research to answer questions such as: health psychologists can also be responsible for training other health professionals on how to deliver interventions to help promote healthy eating, stopping smoking, weight loss, etc. health psychologists also train other health professionals in communication skills such as how to break bad news or support behavior change for the purpose of improving adherence to treatment.health psychologists aid the process of communication between physicians and patients during medical consultations. there are many problems in this process, with patients showing a considerable lack of understanding of many medical terms, particularly anatomical terms  one area of research on this topic involves ""doctor-centered"" or ""patient-centered"" consultations. doctor-centered consultations are generally directive, with the patient answering questions and playing less of a role in decision-making. although this style is preferred by elderly people and others, many people dislike the sense of hierarchy or ignorance that it inspires. they prefer patient-centered consultations, which focus on the patients needs, involve the doctor listening to the patient completely before making a decision, and involving the patient in the process of choosing treatment and finding a diagnosis.health psychologists engage in research and practice aimed at getting people to follow medical advice and adhere to their treatment regimens. patients often forget to take their pills or consciously opt not to take their prescribed medications because of side effects. failing to take prescribed medication is costly and wastes millions of usable medicines that could otherwise help other people. estimated adherence rates are difficult to measure  additionally, traditional cognitive-behavioural therapies have been adapted for people suffering from chronic illnesses and comorbid psychological distress to include modules that encourage, support and reinforce adherence to medical advice as part of the larger treatment approach.health psychologists have identified a number of ways of measuring patients adherence to medical regimens:health psychology attempts to find treatments to reduce or eliminate pain, as well as understand pain anomalies such as episodic analgesia, causalgia, neuralgia, and phantom limb pain. although the task of measuring and describing pain has been problematic, the development of the mcgill pain questionnaire has helped make progress in this area. treatments for pain involve patient-administered analgesia, acupuncture , biofeedback, and cognitive behavior therapy.below are some examples of the types of positions held by health psychologists within applied settings such as the uks nhs and private practice.in the uk, health psychologists are registered by the health professions council   registered health psychologists who are chartered with the bps will have undertaken a minimum of six years of training and will have specialized in health psychology for a minimum of three years. health psychologists in training must have completed bps stage 1 training and be registered with the bps stage 2 training route or with a bps-accredited university doctoral health psychology program. once qualified, health psychologists can work in a range of settings, for example the nhs, universities, schools, private healthcare, and research and charitable organizations. a health psychologist in training might be working within applied settings while working towards registration and chartered status. a health psychologist will have demonstrated competencies in all of the following areas:all qualified health psychologists must also engage in and record their continuing professional development in australia, health psychologists are registered by the psychology board of australia.  the standard pathway to becoming an endorsed health psychologists involves a minimum of six years training and a two-year registrar program.  health psychologists must also undertake continuing professional development ",1,0
"police brutality or excessive use of force by law enforcement can be legally defined as a civil rights violation, where law enforcement officers exercise undue or excessive force against a subject. this may include, but is not limited to, physical or verbal harassment, physical or mental injury, property damage, and, in some cases, death. in some countries, ""the color of law"" protects officers from ambiguous situations.the term ""police brutality"" was first used in britain in the mid-19th century, with the puppet-show  and ""police brutality"" is fast becoming one of our most ""venerated institutions!""the first use of the term in the american press was in 1872, when the chicago tribune reported the beating of a civilian who was under arrest at the harrison street police station.the origin of modern policing hubert locke wrote:when used in print or as the battle cry in a black power rally, police brutality can by implication cover several practices, from calling a citizen by his or her first name to death by a policemans bullet. what the average citizen thinks of when he hears the term, however, is something midway between these two occurrences, something more akin to what the police profession knows as ""alley court""% from 2011 to 2012 compared to 2001 to 2002, with only 1 in 100 cases leading to a conviction. there were also 720 deaths in police custody due to police action from 2011 to 2012.in 2015, as a result of police officers being accused of crimes such as rape, torture, and murder, the cost of civil liabilities claims were so great that there was concern the costs would strain the south african police service national budget. the police commissioner at the time, riah phiyega, attributed the large number of claims ""on a highly litigious climate"".police brutality was a major contribution to the 2011 egyptian revolution and khaled saids death, though little has changed since. one of the ""demands"" around which people decided to take to the streets in egypt was ""purging the ministry of interior"" for its brutality and torture practices.many people have been viciously beaten by police in bangladesh.in may 2017, a man named shamim reja was killed by police in sonargaon police station. the victims father claimed that his son was tortured in the police station as the police wanted bangladeshi taka in shahbag, bangladesh on 26

and had a water cannon, tear gas, and baton charges used on them.on 23 january 2017, a pro-jallikattu silent protest in tamil nadu turned violent. the national human rights commission consolidated reports that the police used violent methods without prior warning, including beatings and damaging private property, to disperse protesters in chennai. there were widespread social media reports of police setting vehicles on fire. the lathi charge is very well known in india as an excessive use of force done by police during mass protests or riots.islamic extremists in indonesia have been targeted by police as terrorists in the country. in many cases they are either captured or killed. there are cases of police corruption involving hidden bank accounts and retaliation against journalists investigating these claims; one example occurred in june 2012 when indonesian magazine tempo had journalist activists beaten by police. separately, on 31 august 2013 police officers in central sulawesi province fired into a crowd of people protesting the death of a local man in police custody; five people were killed and 34 injured. the polices history of violence goes back to the military-backed suharto regime criminal investigations into human rights violations by the police are rare, punishments are light, and indonesia has no independent national body to deal effectively with public complaints. amnesty international has called on indonesia to review police tactics during arrests and public order policing to ensure that they meet international standards.during the bersih protests, malaysian police attacked protesters and killed one. malaysian police also cane prisoners for several offences, including theft, drug dealing and molestation.in singapore, people cannot protest. police have also caned people for vandalism and other offences.the gulf cooperation council  amnesty international reported that a uae worker was subjected to a wide array of torture methods during his time in jail, including beatings and sleep deprivation. uae prisoners are also treated poorly and tortured.authorities in saudi arabia have also been filmed lashing civilians for different reasons.in bahrain, police and military personnel manhandled and shot dead many arab spring protesters.pakistans law enforcement is divided into multiple tiers including forces under provincial and federal government control. the law strictly prohibits any physical abuse of suspected or convicted criminals; however, due to deficiencies during the training process, there have been reported instances of suspected police brutality. reported cases are often investigated by police authorities as well as civil courts leading to mixed outcomes.a recent case includes the purported extra judicial killing of a man named naqeebullah by an ex-officer named ""rao anwar"". taking notice of the matter, the supreme court issued arrest and detention warrants in the case to arrest the accused.in october of 2019, the people national alliance organised a rally to free kashmir from pakistani rule. as a result of the police trying to stop the rally, 100 people were injured.during the 2014 hong kong protests, there were numerous instances of police brutality. seven police officers were caught on video kicking and beating a prominent political activist who was already handcuffed. there had also been more than hundreds of incidents of police beating passers-by with batons. pictures on local tv and social media show demonstrators being dragged behind police lines, circled by police officers so that onlookers views were blocked, and in some cases re-emerging with visible injuries. an officer-involved, retired police officer frankly chu king-wai was sentenced to three months in prison for causing serious bodily harm.during the 20190 hong kong protests which gained extensive international coverage, complaints of police brutality increased substantially and broke previous records of complaints.cases which have caused outrage include the polices mauling and intentional head-shooting of protesters by rubber bullets and rapid tear-gassing of a completely surrounded crowd. numerous were critically wounded. many hong kong citizens accuse the police of attempting to murder protesters to deter the people from exercising their freedom of expression.the amnesty international released a report on 21 june 2019 denouncing the role of the hong kong police in the 12 june protest that ended up in bloodshed.several street conflicts continued in hong kong

the prince edward mtr station and attacked suspects in a train compartment on the tsuen wan line with batons and pepper spray. many suspects sustained head injuries. until november 2019, several alleged cases of sexual violence, ""disappearings"", and falling deaths were found to have been directly involved with hong kong police brutality, and massive attacks on campus and streets have been also occurring with the concurrent deterioration of the city.politically motivated riots and protests have occurred historically in china, notably with the tiananmen square protests of 1989. associations such as falun gong have objected against the chinese communist party and which are dispersed by riot police. chinese protesters have been able to systematize powerful group mobilizations with the use of social media and informal mass communication like twitter and its chinese counterparts weibo.in xintang, canton province  used a website to urge participants not to shout more anti-government slogans, but to go outside for a quiet walk in the places where they had been deciding to continue the protest. after a brutal police response, the authorities installed corrugated metal fences outside the restaurant and the home of dissident and nobel peace prize winner liu xiaobo. hundreds of uniformed and plainclothes security officers and volunteers with red armbands, pre-emptively positioned in wangfujing. this presence interrupted the orderly operation of the shops.turkey has a history of police brutality, including the use of torture particularly between 1977 and 2002. police brutality featured excessive use of tear gas  pepper spray, and water cannons. physical violence against protesters has been observed, for example, in the suppression of kurdish protests and may day demonstrations. the 2013 protests in turkey were in response to the brutal police suppression of an environmentalist sit-in protesting the removal of taksim gezi park.in 2012 several officials received prison sentences for their role in the death in custody of the political activist engin 019 are being investigated by the vienna police department for special investigations.there has been a notable lack of commitment to addressing the violation of civilians rights in austria, with amnesty international reporting that in 1998-1999 very few people who committed a violation of human rights were brought to justice. this was worsened by the fact that many people who made a complaint against police were brought up on counter-charges such as resisting arrest, defamation, and assault.from 2014 to 2015, 250 accusations of police misconduct were made against officers in vienna with none being charged, though 1,329 people were charged with ""civil disorder"" in a similar time period. the council of europes committee for the prevention of torture austria has legislation which criminalizes hate speech against anyones race, religion, nationality or ethnicity. laws like this discourage discrimination, help with altering public perceptions of different ethnic and cultural groups, and subsequently reduce the number of racially motivated incidents of police brutality. austria has several ngos that are trying to implement broad programs that encourage positive cross-cultural relations and more targeted programs such as racial sensitivity training for police. the austrian police are formulating their policies to prevent police brutality, and to make prosecuting police misconduct fairer. in january 2016, austrian police forces started a trial of wearing body cameras to document civilian001 durban declaration and programme of action.belgian law enforcement changed to two police forces operating on a federal and local level in 2001 after a three-tier police system. while the two services remain independent, they integrate common training programs and recruitment. the change was prompted by a national parliamentary report into a series of pedophile murders which proved police negligence and severely diminished public confidence. currently, approximately 33,000 local police and 900 civilians work across 196 regional police forces.the united nations  these principles dictate that use of force should be proportionate, appropriate, reported, and delivered in a timely manner; however, the un human rights committee reported complaints of ill-treatment against property and people by police escalated between 2005 and 2011, most commonly involving assault against persons no longer posing danger. belgian judicial authorities were found to also have failed to notify national police watchdog, committee p, of criminal convictions against police, which is both a direct breach of belgian judicial procedure and a failure to comply with article 40 of the international covenant on civil and political rights.an extreme instance in january 2010 led to the death of jonathan jacob in mortsel. he was apprehended by local mortsel police for behaving strangely under the influence of amphetamines. the footage depicted eight officers from antwerp polices special intervention unit restraining and beating jacob after he had been injected with a sedative sparked public outrage. jacob died from internal bleeding following the incident, but police claimed they did not make any mistakes and ""acted carefully, respecting the necessary precautions"".in 2013, the grand chamber of the european court of human rights  the belgian league of human rights  obspol was formed in 2013 and collects testimonies on its website, informs police brutality victims of their rights, and strongly advocating public policy being adapted in favor victim protection.the constitution of croatia prohibits torture, mistreatment, and cruel and degrading punishment under article 17, and accords arrested and convicted persons humane treatment under article 25 of the ohchr. croatia has a centralised police force under the command of the ministry of the interior with approximately 20,000 police officers.from 1991 to 1995, the croatian police, in addition to their regular police tasks, were a militarised force charged with the role of defending the country while seceding from yugoslavia. military training taught police officers to use firearms before exhausting other procedures, which has affected the philosophy and behaviour of police officers in using excessive force. developments were made to achieve democratic policing as a modern, professional force that is also accountable to the public. however, citizen complaints of violent police behaviour suggest that the militarization of the police force in the early 1990s continues to influence the level of force accepted as legitimate and reasonable by croatian police officers.the european court of human rights has found that croatian police authorities have failed to fulfill their obligations, on numerous occasions, under article 3 of the european convention on human rights and fundamental freedoms by failing to carry out effective investigations to protect its citizens and tourists from violent attacks. in 2009, the european court of human rights condemned croatian police authorities for ignoring requests to starting an investigation into perpetrators who violently attacked a croatian citizen.the croatian police have a history of discriminatory abuse and failing to recognise violence against the romani minority living in croatia. the european commission against racism and intolerance noted that croatian police abuse against minority groups including romani were continually reported; police authorities are reluctant to take violence against romani people seriously. police investigations into black market selling in croatia have been excessively violent towards romani vendors, with reports of physical violence and abusive racism being directed at them. the romani womens association, ""better future"", reported that police had beaten a pregnant romani woman who attempted to evade arrest for black market selling in 2002.the croatian police violence has been used to intimidate refugees travelling from serbia into croatia. this included segregating nationalities, with syrian, iraqi, and afghani nationals gaining entry to croatia as refugees more easily than other nationalities. an unaccompanied sixteen-year-old from morocco recounted his experience trying to gain asylum in croatia after lying about being a syrian national: ""we had to get into a police car  they told us this is slovenia, but then it was serbia  one of my friends tried to run away, but the croatian police caught  him and beat him.""the police of denmark has a force of approximately 11,000 officers and they serve in the 12 police districts and the two danish overseas territories. the danish independent police complaints authority  annual statistics released by the authority revealed a reduction in the number of complaints against police from 2012 to 2015. in 2012, the authority received 726 conduct complaints from across denmark; in 2015, the number of complaints fell to 509, representing approximately 0.05 complaints per officer. a majority of complaints stem from general misconduct, such as traffic violations and unprofessional behaviour however, the 2015 annual report identifies some instances where the police of denmark used excessive force. for example, the authority investigated a complaint made about alleged violence against an arrested person in christianshavn on 15 march 2016. another investigation looked into the alleged use of force against a 16-year-old boy on 28 june 2016, which resulted in charges being laid against the two offending police officers from the sydsj002, 21-year-old jens arne orskov mathiason died while in police custody on the way to prison. the incident raised concerns over the behaviour of the officers involved, the thoroughness of the subsequent investigation, and the willingness of the director of public prosecutions to hold the officers accountable for their alleged failings. as a result, amnesty international called for the establishment of new policies to investigate human rights violations and enforce compliance under the european convention on human rights.in january 2016, a man died in police custody after being arrested by seven copenhagen police officers.in august 2009, police in copenhagen were heavily criticised for their response to an attempt to remove iraqi refugees who were living in a city church. video allegedly showed the police using violence against the refugees and their supporters. between 12,000 and 20,000 people subsequently protested against these actions.in 2012, the danish court of appeal concluded that the danish police had violated article 3 in order to ensure that police are well-trained and to mitigate the risk of police brutality, police recruits undergo approximately three years of training; at the national police college, recruits learn about police theory, the road traffic act, criminal law, physical training, other legislation, first aid, radio communication, securing evidence, identifying drugs, preventing crime, management, human rights, and cultural sociology to name a few. after this training period, recruits are promoted to the position of a police constable. by comparison, us police academies provide an average of 19 weeks of classroom instruction. the prolonged training in denmark was observed to increase the ability of police to effectively de-escalate conflicts and enact their duties professionally and responsibly.in order to keep police officers accountable and to ensure that they perform their duties in compliance with danish, european and international laws, the independent police complaints authority has the power to handle criminal investigations against police officers and determine complaints of police misconduct. this body is independent from both the police and prosecutors. for example, police"" may use force only if necessary and justified and only by such means and to such extent as are reasonable relative to the interest which the police seek to protect. any assessment of the justification of such force must also take into account whether the use of force involves any risk of bodily harm to third parties.""therefore, police in denmark are held to high standards and will face consequences if they breach their obligations to encourage compliance. victims of police misconduct are encouraged to lodge a report with the authority.the estonian police force was temporarily dissolved in 1940 when estonia lost its independence to the soviet union after it was occupied, before the police act passed in 1990 dissolved the soviet militsiya and re-established it. in 2010, the public order police, police board, central criminal police, border guard, citizenship and migration board merged into the police and border guard board. it is the largest state agency in estonia with over 5000 people in employment. the main objectives for this organisation are to maintain security and public order, crime prevention, detection and investigation, securing the european union  they instruct that those who find themselves detained by the police should comply with their instructions and those who experience a language barrier are allowed to ""request the presence of an interpreter and should not sign any documents or reports until they are confident that the documents contents are consistent with the details of the incident or the victims statement"".incidents of police abuse are very rare. although uncommon, powers are sometimes abused which leads to police brutality, such as the 2007 bronze soldier riots.the bronze night occurred from 26 to 29 april 2007, when riots broke out over the bronze soldier of tallinn being relocated. the government wanted to relocate the statue and rebury the associated remains near the tallinn military cemetery; the response was heavily negative among the countrys russophone population, but for estonians historically the bronze soldier served as a symbol of soviet occupation and repression. for russian citizens, it represented soviet russias victory over germany in world war ii and their claim to equal rights in estonia.one russian rioter was killed and other protesters were arrested. due to the overcrowded detention centres many of the detainees were taken to cargo terminals in tallinns seaport. then-chairman of the constitution party andrei zarenkov stated ""people were forced to squat for hours or lie on the concrete floor with their hands tied behind their backs. the police used plastic handcuffs which caused great pain. the police selectively beat the detainees including women and teenagers. we have pictures of a toilet which is stained with the blood of the injured"".the police department denied all claims made against them. on 22 may 2007, the office of prosecutor general of estonia received more than fifty complaints on the police brutality that occurred during bronze night and opened seven criminal cases against them. in november 2007, the united nations committee against torture expressed concerns over the use of excessive force and brutality by law enforcement personnel in regards to bronze night. the council of europe published in its report that those detained were not granted all the fundamental safeguards, including the right to a doctor or a lawyer, and to inform a relative or a third party of their arrest. it was later discovered that the accused were only allowed outside contact and lawyer assistance when brought before a judge. several detainees were denied access to a doctor while in police custody despite displaying visible injuries.the policing structure of nineteenth century france has been linked to the outcomes of frances reorganisation during the french revolution. there have been multiple instances of violent enforcement stemming from issues around racial and geographic differences throughout frances history. additionally, the human rights watch and amnesty international reported human rights violations by france including physical and psychological abuse as a result of excessive force towards muslims when undertaking house raids.frances police ombudsman is currently dealing with 48 judicial inquiries into police brutality against its citizens, in which 1,000 individuals have been arrested within a three-month period. there have been several high-profile cases of alleged police brutality which have gained media attention, including the death of lamine dieng on 17 june 2007, who died after suffocating in a police van while he was constrained. the investigation of lamines death is ongoing.  grey areas around police accountability have come to light, including questions over how his body was covered in bruises and whether or not carotid restraint  the european court of human rights condemned france in 1998 for their apparent use of carotid constriction. this same method of restraint was seen to be used against hakim ajimi who died of positional asphyxia as a result of overwhelming pressure being placed on his chest and neck by police.recent protests over disputed labor laws have revealed the extreme nature of police brutality in france, as many videos have surfaced in the media depicting police using disproportionate force on protesters. french officials have forced these aggressive videos to be destroyed.a group known as the stolen lives collective formed in response to the increased number of cases of police brutality in french communities. it represents families of those who have been affected by police brutality. the group strongly demands the government to act against police brutality and to reduce racism present across the police force in france.on 14 december 2018, amnesty international reported police brutality during the yellow vests movement.historically, anti-communist police brutality was commonplace during the 1920s and 1930s following the finnish civil war. some local sections of the secret police  that police force was seen to be more law-abiding than firemen; however, a few dozen cases each year involved police officers being convicted of crimes committed while on duty, 5 to 10 percent of the hundreds of similar crimes prosecuted annually. the number of these crimes were shown to increase annually. police officers are most often suspected of traffic related crimes  the second highest category in 2006, a 51-year-old police constable lured a 16-year-old girl to his house by showing her his badge, where he got her drunk and raped her twice. the constable was fired and sentenced to a two-year suspended sentence. in 2007, an iranian-born immigrant, rasoul pourak, was beaten in a cell at pasila police station, helsinki, inflicting bruises all over pouraks body, an open wound over his eyebrow, and a fractured skull. facial bones were also broken and he was left permanently damaged. one guard participating in the assault was sentenced to an 80-day suspended prison sentence. in 2010, two police officers assaulted a man in a wheelchair in connection with an arrest. the police twisted the mans hands and pushed him backward and broke a femur in the process. in 2013, two policemen were sentenced to 35 day-fines for assault and breach of duty in connection with stomping on a romani mans head onto the asphalt three times. according to the police, he had resisted, contrary to eyewitness accounts. a third officer testified that the event was captured on surveillance video, which was stored but accidentally destroyed. the officer also stated that they had seen the footage and claimed that the video did not show any resistance on the part on the victim, but also that the assault happened out of the cameras view.germany is sensitive towards its history in implementing policing practices, though this has not stopped international bodies from identifying a clear pattern of police ill-treatment to foreigners and members of ethnic minorities. this does not however mean, that it is limited to foreigners and members of ethnic minorities, which due to a prevalent anti-non-foreigner sentiment in german mainstream media/government may be under-reported. every year, around 2,000 complaints of police brutality are reported, though it is highly suspected that the actual number of cases is under-reported. as high-profile cases like the 2014 cologne new years eve incident become more prevalent, racist and xenophobic attitudes have been reflected in instances of police brutality. high profile cases of police brutality have been reported to occur as far back as 1967:as law enforcement is vested solely with the states of germany, each states police force  even though germany is bound to obligate its many international treaties and conventions, amnesty international a study conducted in 2019 on police brutality in germany found that it led to complaints in only 9%, and to trials in only 13% of the cases. the study was conducted by the ruhr-university of bochum and was the biggest study at the time to be conducted on police brutality in germany. the study found that the low number of complaints was likely due to a low expectation of success. furthermore, most german states do not require their police force to carry identification, making it difficult for victims to lodge complaints against individuals.watchdog organizations have also criticized the lack of independent institutions for investigations into police violence.despite this objective lack of accountability for policing practice, public levels of trust in police remain among the highest in the eu only behind scandinavian countries and switzerland. this allows germany to maintain one of the lowest levels of public order and safety spending in the eu, at 1.5 percent of gross domestic profit, compared to the eu average of 1.8 percent. as a result, germany has a police force of only 300 officers per 100,000 of its population. lower numbers exist in scandinavian countries and the uk, suggesting that germany is attempting to build the impression of having a more laissez-faire approach to policing, despite instances of police brutality. german police officers rarely use their guns; as of august 2017, 109 deaths by service weapons since 1998 were reported and only 8 fatalities in the two years prior to the report, instead they prefer methods of psychological warfare.the greek police, known officially as the hellenic police, assumed their current structure in 1984 as a result of merging the gendarmerie  composed of central and regional departments, the hellenic police have a relatively long history of police brutality. one of the first documented incidents dates back to 1976, where 16-year-old activist sideris isidoropoulos was killed by police while he put up campaign posters on a public building. in 1980, 20-year-old protester stamatina kanelopoulou died at the hands of the greek police. he was beaten to death by police officers during a demonstration commemorating the athens polytechnic uprising. the protests still occur to this day for protesters to commemorate the 1973 uprising. the protests are still commonly affected police brutality around the time of the event.the level and severity of police brutality in greece over the last few years have been profound. due to the recent financial crisis, many austerity measures have been enforced, resulting in many individuals and families struggling to survive. greek citizens opposed these austerity measures from the beginning and showed their disapproval with strikes and demonstrations. in response, police brutality has significantly increased, with consistent reports on the use of tear gas, severe injuries inflicted by the police force, and unjustified detention of protesters.in 2013 greek police allegedly tortured four young men believed to be bank robbery suspects following their arrest. it was claimed that the men were hooked and severely beaten in detention. the media published photos of the men, all with severe bruising, though the polices press release showed digitally manipulated photos of the four without injuries. the greek minister of citizen protection012, 15 anti-fascist protesters were arrested in athens when they clashed with supporters of the fascist party ""golden dawn"". victims claimed they were tortured while being held at the attica general police directorate and stated that police officers slapped them, spat on them, burnt their arms with cigarette lighters, and kept them awake with flashlights and lasers. dendias countered by accusing the british newspaper that published the details of these crimes of libel. it was proven by forensic examination that the torture had in fact taken place. the two greek journalists who commented on the guardian report the next day were fired.police brutality in greece today predominantly manifests itself in the form of unjustified and extreme physical violence towards protesters and journalists. amnesty international highlights that the continued targeting of journalists is concerning as it infringes on the right to freedom of expression. according to a recent amnesty international report, there have been multiple instances in which police have used excessive brutal force, misused less-lethal weapons against protesters, attacked journalists, and subjected bystanders to ill treatment, particularly over the course of the anniversary of the athens polytechnic uprising, which took place on 17 november 2014. allegations against police have emerged specifically in relation to their use of unprovoked brutal force towards journalists documenting the demonstration and against many students who partook in a peaceful protest. police allegedly sprayed protesters with chemical irritants from close range 014, riot police began to strike students who attempted to run away from the grounds of athens polytechnic. media reports suggest that around 40 protesters had to seek subsequent medical attention to injuries sustained from brutal police beatings. amnesty international called for action to prosecute those who were behind the assaults, stating that within the greek police there is a culture of ""abuse and impunity"" which remains as authorities have taken very little action to address the root of the problem.a german exchange student said he was beaten randomly by riot police in the exarheia district, stating his only reason for being there was that he was eating with other students. the student gave a horrifying description of the violence he endured and cowered in a corner when he saw police because a few weeks before he had witnessed police beating a man they had arrested. he claimed that upon spotting him, about six police officers began assaulting him with their batons, and when they left they were replaced by another group of police. the student was unarmed and posed no threat but the police were ruthlessly brutal in their actions. it has been indicated that riot police left beaten and gravely injured individuals without any medical assistance. amnesty international urges greece to effectively and promptly investigate these crimes against civilians, which clearly violate human rights, and hold perpetrators accountable.there have been instances where protesters were used as human shields 008 during demonstrations in athens. unlike other cases, the police officer responsible was convicted of murder.in 2008 when hungarys two law enforcement bodies, the police the 1998 human rights watch world report revealed that the roma minority in hungary were continually discriminated against. it was evident in the police force, with reports of police mistreatment and brutality.the 2006 protests in response to prime minister ferenc gyurcs007, and were essentially a civil war between those who wanted northern ireland to remain in the united kingdom  instances of northern irish police brutality were confirmed by the 1978 report from the european court of human rights, which concluded that five interrogation techniques used by the police, which included wall standing, deprivation of food, drink or sleep, subjection to noise and forcing detainees to remain in the same position for hours, were instances of cruel and degrading treatment. such brutality was not recognized by domestic courts until 2010, where 113 people, some of them minors, came forward to have their complaints heard.at present northern ireland still faces policing issues, though not to the extent during the troubles. there are concerns about harassment by police against children aged 14002 and in 2005; and a fifteen-year-old boy who died after spending time in garda custody. given this state of events, the garda engaged independent human rights experts to conduct a review of the force who found numerous deficiencies. the government responded by implementing new procedures based on this report. these include a new complaints procedure available against the garda the use of violence by police officers has been a major concern in italy during the 2000s. beatings and violence were used during demonstrations, and several murders were carried out during the 2000s.the following incidents caused concern in the country:latvia became an independent republic in 1918 and attempted to develop an effective and accepted police force, moving away from the untrusted russian tsarist administration. despite positive post-independence aims to reform the police system and to maintain public order and security, the latvian police were underfunded and under-resourced. the national militia was created in response, consisting of a group of volunteers to protect public order. policing during this period was quite successful and was assimilated to what is today referred to as community policing.from 1940 to 1991, latvia was occupied by the soviet union, and all previous regulations and practices were overruled by the communist regime, which brought in the soviet militsiya. due to soviet ideals on policing that considered criminals to be the enemy, a high level of institutional secrecy existed and meant that there was no independent review of policing. more significantly, the approach of community policing was replaced with a militarised authority based on marxist ideologies. during this time, an imbalance existed between police actions and citizens rights. despite the lack of statistics, it is clear that police brutality was a major issue, as illustrated by the case where the former nominal head of the militsiya in 1991, the independence of the state of latvia was restored, which saw another change in the police system with the implementation of the law on police on 5 june. this restructured the police into state, security, and local government levels. the law on police reiterated ethical requirements, where police officers were prohibited from performing or supporting acts relating to ""torture or other cruel, inhuman or demeaning treatment or punishment"". however, despite these reforms, issues regarding police brutality arose among the russian population living in latvia; in 1998, police forces were accused of dispersing a rally of predominately russian pensioners through the use of excessive force and brutality. this hostility towards russians remained in the following years, and despite lack of official statistics, police brutality continued to be an issue after latvias independence.in 2005, the latvian center for human rights and ethnic studies  reports showed high levels of corruption within latvian law enforcement authorities, with 42 members convicted of corruption offences between 2003 and 2004. for the latvian community, this meant that should an incident of police brutality occur, they may not have an independent body to report to nor is it guaranteed to be handled impartially without corruption.reports from latvian prisons illustrate cases where police batons were used to inflict serious harm to inmates, including causing broken ribs, which often were not medically assessed for up to two days. to address levels of police brutality, lchres conducted a study where it set up an anonymous hotline. during this four-day study, lchres received almost 300 calls and written complaints regarding police brutality and misconduct. this identifies fundamental flaws in the latvian police authorities.since joining the european union in 2004, the european committee for the prevention of torture  their 2011 report outlined some cases of police brutality within the prison system, with allegations such as punching, kicking and a few cases of misuse of police batons and excessively tight handcuffing. this was alleged to occur mostly while being apprehended or at the police station  recognising that the authorities are conscious of police brutality, and given more time, it is likely that the figures will continue to decrease.the luxembourg police force has 1,603 officers and is known as the ""grand ducal police"". the grand ducal police is the primary law enforcement agency in luxembourg and has been operating since 1 january 2000, when the grand ducal gendarmerie  due to luxembourgs relatively small population of approximately 500,000 people the grand ducal police are in charge of several duties that are often separated by jurisdictions such as border control and internal military operations.police brutality is not perceived to be a serious threat to society in luxembourg. the european unions 2014 anti-corruption report placed luxembourg, along with denmark and finland, as having the lowest incidents of reported police brutality within the european union. due to many positive characteristics of their society, such as freedom of media, the encouragement of public participation in the legal system and transparency mechanisms, the public also have a deep trust in the grand ducal police force.laws in luxembourg specifically distinguish between coercion and force in the 1973 act on regulating the use of force. this act regulates the use of police weapons and specific technical means of physical force used by police. however, this act does not cover other forms of physical coercion by police officers such as the use of handcuffs as these are seen as basic police measures that do not require specific legislation. the officer must be legitimately executing his duty and his actions and must be compatible under the principles of proportionality, subsidiarity, reasonability, and measure in order to use force. to ensure the grand ducal police do not engage in police brutality, numerous safeguards and prevention methods are implemented. the police inspector  by way of comparison, the victoria police academy only provides 33 weeks of tactical and legal training. the 2015 human right report on government practices by the united states indicated no cases of police brutality in luxembourg, suggesting that the grand ducal police have effective mechanisms in place to investigate and punish potential abuse and corruption.although police brutality is almost nonexistent in luxembourg, there are effective procedures in place for the investigation and punishment of any potential misconduct by the grand ducal police.maltas police force under the police act of 1961, part v deals with the use of force, where""police officers may use such moderate and proportionate force as may be necessary ""  however, according to article 100, ""it shall be considered as an offence against discipline if a police officer uses force for considerations extraneous to those permitted by law and the circumstances of the case"". as such, malta recognizes the illegality of police brutality and can prosecute offending officials on these grounds.malta is expected to abide by the 2001 european code of ethics as a member of the european union, where ""the police may use force only when strictly necessary and only to the extent required to obtain a legitimate objective.""similarly, the council of europe in 2008, lawrence gonzi  findings"". following the results of the inquiry of mr. scicluna, made public by the maltese government, it was concluded that ""excessive force was used by detention service personnel"".scicluna made recommendations that ""appropriate  should be taken to reprimand the detention service officers involved in this operation and the relevant senior ncos for the acts of 25 excessive force used by some personnel in their charge"". simultaneously, home affairs minister carm mifsud bonnici said ""95 percent of the members of the police force were doing their duties, but the remainder needed to be addressed"", which led to the establishment of the internal affairs unit  where complaints or allegations on the use of force can be monitored and responded to.although malta has attempted to tackle the police brutality through the implementation of independent systems such as the internal affairs unit  in addition, the 2013 us department of state report found that although there were no government reports on the use of brutality in detention centers, on 2 december 2013 media reported the sentencing of two former prison guards to five years in prison and another two guards to three months in prison after finding them guilty of beating an escaped prisoner in 2008, illustrating the gradual development of the iau in limiting the use of police brutality.after the iau was implemented, the human rights committee has raised questions on the use of force by state officials with respect to the countering of detention center riots, where police were accused of punching and striking detainees. an inquiry was consequently conducted in 2011 and 2012 following riots, resulting in criminal proceedings against the law enforcement officials responsible. in addition, giacomo santini and tina acketoft the committee on the elimination of racial discrimination, in relation to the conditions of migrants in detention, recommended that the ""state party take appropriate measures to improve detention conditions and refrain from resorting to excessive use of force to counter riots by immigrants in detention centers, and also to avoid such riot"".the malta police force issued a statement detailing what had happened, in which it claimed that mr. calleja acted aggressively, refused to take a breathalyser test, ignored police orders, and used foul language.he was subsequently arrested and taken to a police squad car, but according to the police statement, he kicked the driver, tried to escape and banged his head repeatedly against the car window. the police added that he even spit blood at police officers and bit a constables arm, tearing off part of his skin.when asked to state his clients plea, dr. abela declared ""absolutely not guilty,"" before accusing the police of grossly distorting the truth.mr. callejas nose was bandaged, and dr. abela presented a medical certificate showing that it had been broken as evidence. the lawyer also presented his clients blood-stained clothes 5 regional forces and one central force. a regional police board, made up of local mayors and the chief public prosecutor, heads each regional force, with a chief officer placed in charge of police operations. police accountability procedures include mandatory reporting of any on-duty incident that requires the use of force. the rijksrecherche is the national agency responsible for the investigation of serious breaches of police conduct resulting in death or injury. in 2007 the rijksrecherche conducted 67 inquiries related to police officers, 21 of which were related to shootings.while dutch society has a history of support for liberal values, it has been subject to practicing racial profiling and increased levels of police violence towards racial minorities. van der leun writes that suspicion and mistrust of some racial groups is evident and perpetuated by police attitudes at all levels of command. this trend in police behaviour has drawn comment from amnesty international, where a 2015 report describes dutch law enforcement officers as having a tendency to correlate suspicious criminal behaviour with specific ethnic characteristics, most notably those typical of persons of moroccan heritage. current political discourse in the netherlands often supports the notion of inferiority of some cultures and is evidenced by the growth in support for far-right political ideologies in recent decades.a notable case in racial profiling and the use of police force occurred in june 2015 with the death of aruban man mitch henriquez. henriquez died of asphyxiation while in police custody after being suspected of carrying a firearm and being arrested at a music festival in the hague. the first anniversary of his death in june 2019 provided a catalyst for protests against police brutality in the hague, an area with a significant proportion of residents of non-european background. eleven protesters were arrested for failing to comply with instructions from the mayor to limit protest to certain areas of the city, which led some protesters to claim authorities were attempting to criminalize the right to peaceful protest. the five officers alleged to be involved in hendriquezs death have been suspended but have yet to be charged.the polish police  polish laws prohibit torture or degrading treatment and set out punishment for police officers including demotion and removal from the police force.a key factor influencing the levels of police brutality in poland has been the move from a communist state to a democracy. force was particularly used by the zomo squads, which were elite units of citizens militia  as a result, the opposition branded zomo with the nickname ""communist gestapo"". it is argued that polands transition has resulted in a more transparent system, reducing levels of police brutality. although police brutality exists within poland cases are much more likely to be handled by the criminal justice system with a greater chance for resolution through the courts.while there are still instances of police brutality, trust in the police has steadily increased in poland from 62% to 75% between 2002 and 2008, demonstrating the improvement in trust between the police and the general public.although there is a more open police force within poland, many organizations still have issues against police brutality. the 2013 united states department of state report on poland raised several concerns of police brutality; the report cited a case of police officers using violence to acquire a confession for armed robbery in 2012, though it also noted that these police officers were eventually indicted for police brutality.in recent years one of the main sources of controversy concerning polish police brutality has been the use of rubber bullets to disperse uncooperative crowds at sporting events.in 1998, major riots occurred when a young basketball fan was killed by the police. in 2004, a man was killed and a woman injured in a riot when polish police accidentally shot live ammunition instead of rubber bullets into the crowd after an association football game. another set of riots occurred in 2015 in response to a pitch invasion during a football match. although rubber bullets were used, one man was hit in the neck and later died at the hospital. a former police officer justified the use of weapons as a means to combat football hooliganism. protesters have characterized the detainment of sports fans protesting against the government as unfair and undemocratic.the polish police also have a history of police brutality within the roma community. there are multiple cases of police beatings and other discriminatory acts against the roma by the police. the european roma rights centre argues that investigations into police brutality cases are seldom carried out and that the police brutality against the roma minority is systematic.one particular case of police brutality against the romani people occurred in 1998 when the police took four roma men to a field and beat them. the men that were beaten were hospitalised for broken bones and other injuries; they were charged with vulgar words and behavior in public.portugal is ranked the fourth most heavily policed country in the world. the police force is divided into five main organisations, with the pol015, a viral video showed a benfica fan being heavily beaten in front of his two children outside a football stadium. the footage, filmed by a local television station, showed jose magalhaes leaving the football match early with his children and elderly father before being confronted by police officers. although the family appeared calm, magalhaes was tackled to the ground by police and repeatedly hit with a metal baton, while his father was punched in the face twice. more police rushed to the scene to shield the children aged nine and thirteen.a statement released by the psp acknowledged the controversial incident and announced that an investigation was launched against the officer responsible for initiating the attack. the officer was later suspended for 90 days by the ministry of internal affairs.the statement also defended policing the large crowds in the aftermath of the football match. riot police had clashed with supporters the following day in lisbon as fans celebrated benficas title victory. the harsh approach was described as sufficient, justified, and necessary to prevent social disorder from escalating.in a similar incident in 2016, another football club, sporting lisbon, complained about ""barbaric"" police assaults on their fans.there have been suggestions of institutionalised racism within the portuguese police force, with activists claiming that discrimination is the deep-rooted cause of police brutality in portugal. in its 2015/2016 annual report on portugal, amnesty international condemned the excessive force used by police against migrant and minority communities.despite a good record in migrant integration, historical parallels can be drawn between portugals colonial past and modern police racism. according to activists, police have killed 14 young black men since 2001; however, no police officer has been held responsible for the deaths.racially-influenced police actions are illustrated by the violence in cova de moura, a low socio-economic area housing a significant migrant population. notably, during an incident in february 2015, a young man named bruno lopes was aggressively searched and physically abused. when bystanders protested the excessive force, police responded by firing shotguns loaded with rubber bullets at the witnesses.on the same day, two human rights workers and five youth entered the alfragide police station requesting information on lopes situation. upon arrival, the group was allegedly attacked by police officers shouting racist slurs. the policemen dragged and kept the young men in the police station, where they detained, mistreated, and mocked them for two days.17 police officers from the alfragide police station were eventually sent to trial on a variety of charges, including physical aggression, torture, document forging, and aggravated kidnapping. {{outdated}} as of october 2018, the trial is ongoing, with victims being heard in court.the european commission against racism and intolerance  in its fifth country report of 2018, ecri mentions the alfragide case in connection to the failure of igai  igai is currently the body responsible for scrutinizing police activities in the country, but it is part of the ministry of the interior like the police forces. in its 2018 report, ecri recommended that such work should be carried out by the countrys ombudsman, an equality body, or by a new and portuguese people of roma descent have also been victims of police harassment and brutality in the country. there are several examples publicized by the media: one case from 2007 involved a roma man and his son. the two walked to the nelas police station in porto to get some information, but the police allegedly ended up abusing them. two officers were convicted in 2011 for physically assaulting the father.an example of police brutality occurred in 2012 is the night raid of a roma camp site by the gnr  a last remnant of overt institutional racism, in portugal, is article 81 of gnrs regulation law, which provides for an increased policing of nomadic people, who in general are known to be mostly roma; the regulations constitutionality was unsuccessfully challenged in the 1980s.russian protests have gained media attention with the reelection of vladimir putin in 2012. more attention has been given to the frequency of police brutality shown on posted videos online. then-president dmitry medvedev initiated reforms of the police force in an attempt to minimize the violence by firing the moscow police chief and centralising police powers. police divisions in russia are often based on loyalty systems that favor bureaucratic power among political elites. phone tapping and business raids are common practice in the country, and often fail to give due process to citizens. proper investigations into police officials are still considered insufficient by western standards.in 2012, russias top investigative agency investigated charges that four police officers had tortured detainees under custody. human rights activists claim that russian police use torture techniques to extract false confessions from detainees. police regulations require officers to meet quotas for solved crimes, which encourages false arrests to meet their numbers.police brutality in slovakia is systematic and widely documented, but is almost exclusively enacted on the romani minority. the nation-state itself has particularly racist attitudes toward the romani minority dating back to before the split of czechoslovakia. it is widely known that the government practiced forced sterilisation of romani women and the segregation of the romani into walled-off settlements; these forms of discrimination has filtered down to the police force. excessive use of force against the romani minority by police has been publicly criticised by the united nations. the police force has been repeatedly condemned by several organisations for lengthy pre-trial detention and its treatment of suspects in custody.in 2001, a 51-year-old romani man died as a result of abuse in police custody at the hands of the mayor of magnezitovce and his son who works as a police officer. the victim, karol sendrei, was allegedly chained to a radiator and fatally beaten after being forcefully removed from his home. while the mayors son was immediately removed from the police force and the mayor was suspended from his position, the latter was reinstated 4 months later. in response to this incident, the minister for internal affairs attempted to establish new measures to prevent police brutality by including mandatory psychological testing for law enforcement and better training around the effective use of coercion. however, police brutality toward the roma minority remains a serious issue.video footage shot by law enforcement officers in 2009 shows 6 romani boys aged between 6-16 being forced to strip naked, kiss, and slap each other. it is alleged that the boys were then set upon by police dogs, with at least two sustaining serious injuries. officers attempted to justify their behaviour on the grounds that the boys were suspected of theft against an elderly citizen; however, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment by police, regardless of whether a crime has been suspected or committed, is prohibited under international law. the 10 law enforcement officers involved have since been acquitted after the judge ruled the video inadmissible in court as it was obtained illegally. as the footage was the main piece of evidentiary support for the crime, without it a conviction could not be passed down.human rights watchdog organisations have raised concerns around police selectivity in making recordings of raids after a raid in the settlement of vrbica in 2015; the police claimed to have not thought the settlement would be problematic; this raid involved 15 men being seriously injured.it is often the experience of the roma in regards to pressing charges for police brutality, a counter charge is often threatened by law enforcement in an attempt to pressure the alleged victim into dropping the charges. it is generally an effective move as the hostile attitude toward the roma in slovakia is so entrenched that lawyers are often reluctant to represent romani victims.minority groups in slovenia, particularly the roma and any residents from the former yugoslav republic face discrimination and sometimes brutality by slovenian police. the roma are major targets because of their being stereotyped as an inherently criminal population. they often live in illegal settlements in very low socio-economic conditions, which contributes to their discrimination and their reputation as criminals. they are one of the ethnic minorities from former yugoslavic states known as ""the erased"" who, after slovenias declaration of independence in 1991, lost all legal status, social, civil and political rights. this made them particularly vulnerable to police brutality. their rights have not been fully restored yet. due to their lack of rights and legal status, it is difficult to hold police officers accountable for offences committed against the romani.the police have been known to occasionally use excessive force against detainees in prisons, as well as foreigners and other minority groups, though no police officer has ever been arrested or charged. it is argued that authorities turn a blind eye to any allegations that arise because the victims are often from ethnic minorities, and there is a culture of racism within parts of the police force. when investigations are made, they are often ineffective.the worst case of police brutality was the november 2012 protests; political dissatisfaction spurred a series of protests in maribor, slovenia. for the most part, the protests were peaceful; the crowds chanted and behaved non-violently for about two hours on 26 november 2012  however, the violence began when crowds moved towards an area with a heavy police presence. police used excessive force to disperse the crowds, including tear gas, dragging and beating protesters, police dogs, and mounted police who indiscriminately charged into the crowd. civilians, protesters, and journalists were all targeted. authorities attempted to justify the use of force by claiming protesters were violent and the use of force was necessary and not excessive. slovenian media sources reported that the protest only turned violent after the police started using physical force. this level of violence was unprecedented and entirely unexpected in slovenia.since 2003, slovenian authorities have attempted to rectify this discrimination by introducing a two-day training programme on policing in a multi-ethnic community. the programme involved teaching police about roma culture and their language which helped to break down some of the stereotypes that caused tension. the roma were made aware of their rights, and the police were educated about national and international standards regarding treatment of minorities. it also helped to build trust between the roma community and police. tensions still exist between the two groups, especially concerning police who have not participated in this programme; however, they have been greatly reduced.spanish police developed a global reputation for brutality after images of clashes between demonstrators and police were spread on social networks and international news in 2011 and 2012. two notable demonstrations were the ones that occurred in barcelona on 27 may 2011, and in madrid on 25 september 2012. video footage published online showed the use of force by police against peaceful demonstrators on both occasions. images show officers using handheld batons to repeatedly hit peaceful demonstrators in spite of public outrage, the spanish government did not make any attempt to reform policing and police mistreatment of the public; the opposite happened instead: in july 2016, new reforms to the law on public security and the criminal code were enforced which limited the right to freedom of assembly and gave police officers the broad discretion to fine people who show a ""lack of respect"" towards them. the law on public security also includes an offence of spreading images of police officers in certain cases. the un human rights commission has expressed concern at the impact this legislation could have on human rights and police accountability. fines for insulting a police officer can be up to 014 report of torture in the spanish state found at least 941 people were tortured by law enforcement in 2014- at demonstrations and other public situations and in police stations and prisons. jorge del cura, a spokesman for the committee for the prevention of torture which collected 6621 complaints between 2004 and 2014. claimedthe practice of torture is an everyday reality in spain  day after day we receive information from people who have suffered all kinds of abuse and torture from stress positions to push-ups, rape or physical assault.there were only 752 convictions of police for mistreatment during this 10-year period. pau perez, an advisor to the national mechanism for the prevention of torture notes that of the torture allegations made against police 50% were from people belonging to social movements and 40% were from immigrants cases of racial discrimination in a single year, emphasising that many of these did not lead to official complaints because victims feared police retaliation or believed their complaints would be ignored. this belief is not unfounded; in 2005, beauty solomon, an african american immigrant working as a prostitute, filed two criminal complaints against spanish policemen for repeated harassment and physical assault. in spite of eyewitness testimony and medical reports confirming her injuries the spanish courts dismissed her claims on the grounds of insufficient evidence. solomon then took her case to the european court of human rights, who unanimously ruled in her favour that spain had violated article 3 under spanish law the police have the right to check the identity of anyone in a public space when there is a security concern. however, african and latin american immigrants are most frequently targeted, often without a legitimate security concern. ""people who do not look spanish can be stopped by police as often as four times a day,"" said izza leghtas, an amnesty international researcher.since the reva in 2013 police shot a man in his own home in front of his wife in the town of husby. the police alleged the man had been wielding a machete and threatening them with it. the stockholm riots were set off after the husby shooting, where more than 100 cars were torched. when the police showed up they had stones thrown at them. people said the police called them ""monkeys"" and used batons against them in the clash.in another incident in 2013, an african-born swede was refused entry into a local club in malm9 romani people is kept by police. the police say the document is a register of criminals and their associates and is used to fight crime in sk016, a nine-year-old was accused of not paying for a railway ticket in malm015 the united kingdom employed approximately 126,818 police officers in the 43 police forces of england, wales and the british transport police, the lowest number since march 2002.the 1967 criminal law act, the 2008 common law and the criminal justice and immigration act, the 1984 police and criminal evidence act, and the european convention on human rights  the use of force should be ""reasonable"" in the circumstances. physical force is considered appropriate if:this requires a consideration of the degree of force used. any excessive use of force by a police officer is unlawful and an officer could be prosecuted under criminal law.since 2004/05, the independent police complaints commission  these figures more than doubled when the ipcc was first erected. the annual report for 2015/16 was published on 26 july 2016. a total of 37,105 complaints were recorded in 2014/15, marking a 6% increase to the previous year, and a 62% overall increase since 2004/05. allegations of ""neglect or failure in duty"" accounted for 34% of all allegations recorded while ""other assault"" and ""oppressive conduct"" or harassment made up only 8% and 6% respectively.despite an average reduction in deaths in custody since 2004, a 2014 public confidence survey revealed that public satisfaction following contact with the police was falling and that there was a greater willingness to file a complaint. the metropolitan police, who operate in some of the most ethnically diverse parts of the uk, received the greatest number of complaints in 2014/15 at 6,828 claims. however, young people and people from black or minority ethnic groups were much less likely to come forward with complaints.while instances of police brutality in the uk is comparatively less than its us counterpart, there are nonetheless high profile incidents that have received wide media coverage.in may 2013, 21-year-old julian cole was arrested outside a nightclub in bedford by six police officers. the altercation left mr cole in a vegetative state due to a severed spinal cord. expert evidence indicated that mr cole was struck with considerable force on his neck whilst his head was pulled back. despite calls by the ipcc to suspend the officers, bedfordshire chief constable colette paul refused to place the six police officers on restricted duties despite being under criminal investigation. the bedfordshire police denied allegations that the use of excessive force on cole was race-related.on 20 february 2014, bedfordshire police constables christopher thomas and christopher pitts, chased faruk ali before allegedly knocking him over and punching him in the face outside his family home. ali was described as an autistic man who had the mental age of a five-year-old. the police officers who were accused of laughing throughout the ordeal were cleared of misconduct in public office by the aylesbury crown court. following an investigation by the ipcc, the officers were fired following breaches of standards of professional conduct including standards of honesty, integrity, authority, equality, and diversity.on 13 july 2016, 18-year-old mzee mohammed died in police custody after being detained by merseyside police at a liverpool shopping centre. officers were called to the scene after mzee was allegedly behaving aggressively and erratically while armed with a knife. after successfully detaining mzee, the police called an ambulance after mzee suffered a ""medical episode"" and was pronounced dead. video evidence surfaced showing mohammed surrounded by officers and paramedics, seemingly fully unconscious while being placed face down with his hands handcuffed behind his back. questions remain about how appropriate medical condition could have been administered given how the handcuffs would restrict breathing. mohammed is the 21st black person to die in police custody in six years.there have been several high-profile cases of alleged police brutality, including the 2010 g-20 toronto summit protests, the 2012 quebec student protests, the robert dzieka014, 300 people were arrested in montreal at a protest against police brutality.in the united states, major political and social movements have involved excessive force by police, including the civil rights movement of the 1960s, anti-war demonstrations, the war on drugs, and the global war on terrorism. in 2014, the un committee against torture condemned police brutality and excessive use of force by law enforcement in the us, and highlighted the ""frequent and recurrent police shootings or fatal pursuits of unarmed black individuals"". the united nations working group of experts on people of african descents 2016 report noted that ""contemporary police killings and the trauma that they create are reminiscent of the past racial terror of lynching.""seven members of the united states maryland military police were convicted for the abu ghraib torture and prisoner abuse incidents in iraq. detainees were abused within the prison by being forced to jump on their naked feet, being videotaped in sexually exploitative positions, having chains around their neck for photos, and being kept naked for days.the united states has developed a notorious reputation for cases of police brutality, having reported far more incidents of killings by police officers than the rest of the western world. u.s. police killed 1,093 people in 2016 and 1,146 people in 2015. mass shootings have killed 339 people since 2015, whereas police shootings over the same time span claimed the lives of 4,355 people. an fbi homicide report from 2012 observed that while black people represent 13% of the us population, they amounted for 31% of those killed by police.breonna taylor was murdered at the age of 26, when police entered her apartment to serve a no-knock warrant. this type of warrant has since become banned in louisville, kentucky, where breonna lived. the officers were reportedly not looking for taylor or her partner, ""but for an unrelated suspect who did not live in the complex."" when her boyfriend heard the plainclothes police enter their home, he fired a warning shot. this warning shot wounded sgt. jonathan mattingly in the thigh. the police responded by firing 28 shots, 8 of which are said to have hit breonna. the shots were lethal for her. the police officers involved were not charged of any crime. brett hankison, an officer involved in her death, has been firedon 25 may 2020, george floyd, who was unarmed and in handcuffs, died after a minneapolis police officer, derek chauvin, knelt on his neck for over nine minutes the police in brazil have a history of violence against the lower classes. it dates back to the nineteenth century when it primarily served as an instrument to control slaves. in a mostly rural country, the police forces were heavily influenced by local large landowners known as ""colonels"".in the latter half of the twentieth century, the country was heavily urbanized, while over its last military dictatorship state governments became responsible for brazilian police forces experiencing which became heavily militarized.the militarist approach to dealing with social issues led the country to its highest violence levels and in 2015 brazil had more violent deaths than the syrian civil war, with most people fearing the police. more than 6,160 people were killed by the brazilian police in 2018. in 2019, the state of rio de janeiro alone registered 1,814 killings by members of the police force in 2019, setting a new record. a significant portion of the officers involved had already been charged for crimes previously.protests against police brutality started in bogot020. the unrest has since spread to many cities throughout colombia. as of 12020, 13 people have died and over 400 have been injured as part of the protests.in recent years, chiles police force carabineros de chile has been under investigation because of various cases of power abuse and police brutality, particularly towards students participating in riots for better education and the indigenous mapuche people; countless cases of violence were enacted on this group for allegedly committing crimes; it was later discovered that some carabineros officers were responsible for these crimes and blamed mapuches.one of the recent cases involving the mapuche was camilo catrillancas death. the first reports of his death came from the carabineros who claimed that camilo shot at a police officer and others while being investigated for allegedly stealing 3 cars. the carabineros special forces team comando jungla was in the araucan0190 chilean protests, carabineros de chile has caused hundreds of eye mutilations on protesters and random civilians with so-called ""rubber"" bullets and tear gas cannisters . the most notorious cases are of the victims with complete loss of vision gustavo gatica  and fabiola campillai a police officer fatally shot the 19-year-old man, kumanjayi walker, in the central australian town of yuendumu.police officers are legally permitted to use force, and their superiors and the public expect them to do so. jerome herbert skolnick writes in regards to dealing largely with disorderly elements of the society, some people working in law enforcement may gradually develop an attitude or sense of authority over society, particularly under traditional reaction-based policing models; in some cases the police believe that they are above the law.there are many reasons as to why police officers can sometimes be excessively aggressive. it is thought that psychopathy makes some officers more inclined to use excessive force than others. in one study, police psychologists surveyed officers who had used excessive force. the information obtained allowed the researchers to develop five unique types of officers, only one of which was similar to the bad apple stereotype. these include personality disorders; previous traumatic job-related experience; young, inexperienced, or authoritarian officers; officers who learn inappropriate patrol styles; and officers with personal problems. schrivers categorized these groups and separated the group that was the most likely to use excessive force. however, this ""bad apple paradigm"" is considered by some to be an ""easy way out"". a broad report commissioned by the royal canadian mounted police on the causes of misconduct in policing calls it ""a simplistic explanation that permits the organization and senior management to blame corruption on individuals and individual faults 015, the percentage of people who have confidence in the police hit its lowest since 1993 at 52 percent. of this 52 percent democrats saw the biggest drop in confidence. democrats confidence in police dropped to 42% from 2017018 compared with 2012013, a larger change than for any other subgroup. over the same period, independents  the number of black people that trust the police in 2017018 averaged 30 percent, well below the national average of 53% and much lower than for any other subgroup.individual state statutes and police department policies generally say that police officers are legally allowed to shoot in the instance that they feel the need to protect their lives or an innocent life or to prevent the suspect from escaping and posing a dangerous threat to bystanders in society. the supreme court decision of tennessee v. garner made it possible to shoot a fleeing suspect only if they may cause harm to innocent people to prevent officers from shooting every suspect that tries to escape.lorie fridell, associate professor of criminology at university of south florida states that ""racial profiling was the number one issue facing police "", which led her to two conclusions: ""bias in policing was not just a few officers in a few departments and, overwhelmingly, the police in this country are well-intentioned."" the country as a whole sets stereotypes as well as biases against black americans which inevitably leads to social misinterpretation of the safety of americans when a black person is present.an experiment done in 2014 conducted on white undergraduate female students suggests that there is a higher degree of fear of racial minorities which gives reason for authorities to believe racial minorities are dangerous, leading to many minority-related shootings. the experiment supports the theory of dehumanization and lack of empathetic concern for minorities displayed by citizens of the racial majority.incidents resulting in high profile deaths of innocent black men like eric garner in new york city, tamir rice in cleveland, and freddie gray in baltimore demonstrate to the black community that they can no longer trust the police force. as a result of this lack of trust in police officers, the black society created many social organizations, such as the black lives matter movement founded in 2013.while the justice department reported that cleveland police officers used ""excessive deadly force, including shootings and head strikes with impact weapons; unnecessary, excessive, and retaliatory force, including tasers, chemical sprays, and their fists"" on the victim, there was no real repercussions from their actions.in a report released concerning the shooting of michael brown in ferguson, missouri, the justice department admitted to the fergusons police departments pattern of racial bias. the department argued that it is typically an effort to ticket as many low-income black residents as possible in an attempt to raise local budget revenue through fines and court fees. the justice department explained police encounters could get downright abusive when the person being questioned by the police officers becomes disrespectful or challenges their authority.the department of justice also released a statement that confronted police officers susceptibility to implicit bias: one of the things they looked was ""threat perception failure"", where an officer may believe that the person was armed and it turned out not to be the case. these failures were observed to occur more frequently when the suspect was black.in the united states in the late 2010s there has been a increase in the number of police brutality cases. in 2013, the number of deaths caused by police officer misconduct increased from 397 to 426 deaths.in a study done by the research triangle institute in 2015, arrest-related deaths were ranked higher than supplementary homicide reports in us deaths by approximately 4%.a study conducted by the police violence tracking website fatalencounters.org showed the records of over 26,000 people killed by police across the us since 2000, at an average of over 1300 people per year until 2019. in 2016, police killed 574 white americans, 266 african americans, 183 hispanics, 24 native americans, and 21 asians. however, for every million in population, police killed 10.13 native americans, 6.66 african americans, 3.23 hispanics, 2.9 white americans, and 1.17 asians.in 2017, there were 1,147 deaths accounted for by police, of which in 13 cases police officers were charged with a crime. 640 of the deaths caused by police officers that year were responses to non-violent offenses and no crime was reported. 149 people killed by the police were unarmed.a study done by mappingpoliceviolence.org shows that in 2019 there was only 27 days where police in the united states didnt kill someone. it also showed black people are three times more likely to be killed than white people.studies have shown that ""black people are three times more likely to be killed by police in the united states than white people. more unarmed black people were killed by police than unarmed white people last year,"" despite the fact that only 14% of the population are black people.in england and wales, an independent organization known as the independent police complaints commission police brutality is measured based on the accounts of people who have experienced or seen it, as well as the juries who are present for trials involving police brutality cases, as there is no objective method to quantify the use of excessive force for any particular situation. in 1985, only one out of five people thought that police brutality was a serious problem. police brutality is relative to a situation: it depends on if the suspect is resisting. out of the people who were surveyed about their account with the police brutality in 2008, only about 12% felt as if they had been resisting. although police force itself cannot be quantified, the opinion of brutality among various races, genders, and ages can. african americans, women, and younger people are more likely to have negative opinions about the police than caucasians, men, and middle-aged to elderly individuals.various community groups have criticized police brutality. these groups often stress the need for oversight by independent civilian review boards and other methods of ensuring accountability for police action.umbrella organizations and justice committees usually support those affected. amnesty international is a non-governmental organization focused on human rights with over 3 million members and supporters around the world. the stated objective of the organization is ""to conduct research and generate action to prevent and end grave abuses of human rights, and to demand justice for those whose rights have been violated"".tools used by these groups include video recordings, which are sometimes broadcast using websites such as youtube.civilians have begun independent projects to monitor police activity in an effort to reduce violence and misconduct. these are often called ""cop watch"" programs.",1,0
"mindfulness is the practice of purposely bringing ones attention to experiences occurring in the present moment without judgment, a skill one develops through meditation or other training. mindfulness derives from sati, a significant element of buddhist traditions, and based on zen, vipassan32in this two-component model, self-regulated attention :233an ancient model of the mind, generally known as the five-aggregate model enables one to understand the moment-to-moment manifestation of subjective conscious experience, and therefore can be a potentially useful theoretical resource to guide mindfulness interventions.the five aggregates are described as follows:this model describes how sensory consciousness results in the generation of feelings, perception or volition, and how individuals300 years, with some criticisms arising.according to jon kabat-zinn the practice of mindfulness may be beneficial to many people in western society who might be unwilling to adopt buddhist traditions or vocabulary. western researchers and clinicians who have introduced mindfulness practice into mental health treatment programs usually teach these skills independently of the religious and cultural traditions of their origins. programs based on mbsr and similar models have been widely adopted in schools, prisons, hospitals, veterans centers, and other environments.mindfulness-based stress reduction  developed by jon kabat-zinn at the university of massachusetts medical center, which uses a combination of mindfulness meditation, body awareness, and yoga to help people become more mindful. while mbsr has its roots in spiritual teachings, the program itself is secular.mindfulness-based cognitive therapy  it uses traditional cognitive behavioral therapy  mindfulness and mindfulness meditation focus on becoming aware of all incoming thoughts and feelings and accepting them, but not attaching or reacting to them.like cbt, mbct functions on the theory that when individuals who have historically had depression become distressed, they return to automatic cognitive processes that can trigger a depressive episode. the goal of mbct is to interrupt these automatic processes and teach the participants to focus less on reacting to incoming stimuli, and instead accepting and observing them without judgment. this mindfulness practice allows the participant to notice when automatic processes are occurring and to alter their reaction to be more of a reflection. research supports the effects of mbct in people who have been depressed three or more times and demonstrates reduced relapse rates by 50%.mindfulness-based pain management  adapting the core concepts and practices of mindfulness-based stress reduction  it was developed by vidyamala burch and is delivered through the programs of breathworks. it has been subject to a range of clinical studies demonstrating its effectiveness.acceptance and commitment therapy or  used in psychotherapy. it is a psychological intervention that uses acceptance and mindfulness strategies mixed in different ways with commitment and behavior-change strategies, to increase psychological flexibility. the approach was originally called comprehensive distancing. it was developed in the late 1980s by steven c. hayes, kelly g. wilson, and kirk strosahl.mindfulness is a ""core"" exercise used in dialectical behavior therapy  in the sense of ""the reconciliation of opposites in a continual process of synthesis."" as a practitioner of buddhist meditation techniques, linehan says:this emphasis in dbt on a balance of acceptance and change owes much to my experiences in studying meditation and eastern spirituality. the dbt tenets of observing, mindfulness, and avoidance of judgment are all derived from the study and practice of zen meditations.mode deactivation therapy  mindfulness techniques such as simple breathing exercises are applied to assist the client in awareness and non-judgmental acceptance of unpleasant and distressing thoughts and feelings as they occur in the present moment. mode deactivation therapy was developed and is established as an effective treatment for adolescents with problem behaviors and complex trauma-related psychological problems, according to recent publications by jack a. apsche and joan swart.since 2006, research supports promising mindfulness-based therapies for a number of medical and psychiatric conditions, notably chronic pain the british doctor clive sherlock developed adaptation practice in 1977. adaptation practice is a structured program of self-discipline.hakomi therapy, under development by ron kurtz and others, is a somatic psychology based upon asian philosophical precepts of mindfulness and nonviolence.internal family systems model mindfulness relaxation uses breathing methods, guided imagery, and other practices to relax the body and mind and help reduce stress.in 2012 congressman tim ryan of ohio published a mindful nation, and received a $1000, the inner kids program, a mindfulness-based program developed for children, was introduced into public and private school curricula in the greater los angeles area.mindup, a classroom-based program spearheaded by goldie hawns hawn foundation, teaches students to self-regulate behavior and mindfully engage in focused concentration required for academic success. for the last decade, mindup has trained teachers in over 1,000 schools in cities from arizona to washington.the holistic life foundation, a non-profit organization that created an in-school mindfulness program called mindful moment, is currently serving almost 350 students daily at robert w. coleman elementary school and approximately 1300 students at patterson park high school in baltimore, maryland. at patterson high school, the mindful moment program engages the schools faculty along with the students during a 15-minute mindfulness practice at the beginning and end of each school day.mindful life project, a non-profit 501mindfulness practices are becoming more common within educational institutions including elementary and secondary schools. this has been referred to as part of a contemplative turn in education that has emerged since the turn of the millennium. the applications of mindfulness in schools are aimed at calming and relaxation of students as well as for students and educators to build compassion and empathy for others. an additional benefit to mindfulness in education is for the practice to reduce anxiety and stress in students. based on a broad meta-analytical review, scholars argued that the application of mindfulness practice enhances the goals of education in the 21st century, which include adapting to a rapidly changing world and being a caring and committed citizen. within educational systems, the application of mindfulness practices shows an improvement of students attention and focus, emotional regulation, creativity, and problem solving skills. as discussed by ergas and todd, the development of this field since the turn of the millennium has brought diverse possibilities as well as complexities, given the origins of mindfulness within buddhism and the processes of its secularization and measurement based on science.renshaw and cook state, 014, led by ruby wax.mindfulness has gained increasing empirical attention since 1970 and has been studied often as an intervention for stress reduction. meta analyses indicate its beneficial effects for healthy adults, for adolescents and children, as well as for different health-related outcomes including weight management, psychiatric conditions, heart disease, sleep disorders, cancer care, adult autism treatment, and other health-related conditions. an often-cited meta-analysis on meditation research published in jama in 2014, found insufficient evidence of any effect of meditation programs on positive mood, attention, substance use, eating habits, sleep, and weight, but found that there is moderate evidence that meditation reduces anxiety, depression, and pain. however, this study included a highly heterogeneous group of meditation styles  nonetheless, mindfulness meditation is a popular subject for research, and many present potential benefits for a wide array of conditions and outcomes. for example, the practice of mindfulness has also been used to improve athletic performance, as a beneficial intervention for children with special needs and their caregivers, as a viable treatment option for people with insomnia an effective intervention for healthy aging, as a strategy for managing dermatological conditions and as a useful intervention during pregnancy and the perinatal period. recent studies have also demonstrated that mindfulness meditation significantly attenuates physical pain through multiple, unique mechanisms. meditation also may allow one to modulate pain. when exposed to pain from heating, the brain scans of the mindfulness meditation participants further, mindfulness meditation also appears to lead to increased telomere length, which is an important finding considering that short telomeres can be a risk factor for the development of several chronic health conditions. research has also investigated mindful movements and mindful exercises for different patient populations. mindfulness-based approaches are a major subject of increasing research interest, 52 papers were published in 2003, rising to 477 by 2012. nearly 100 randomized controlled trials had been published by early 2014.research studies have also focused on the effects of mindfulness on the brain using neuroimaging techniques, physiological measures and behavioral tests. research on the neural perspective of how mindfulness meditation works suggests that it exerts its effects in components of attention regulation, body awareness and emotional regulation. when considering aspects such as sense of responsibility, authenticity, compassion, self-acceptance and character, studies have shown that mindfulness meditation contributes to a more coherent and healthy sense of self and identity. neuroimaging techniques suggest that mindfulness practices such as mindfulness meditation are associated with  adam valerio has introduced the idea that conflict between academic disciplines over how mindfulness is defined, understood, and popularly presented may be indicative of a personal, institutional, or paradigmatic battle for ownership over mindfulness, one where academics, researchers, and other writers are invested as individuals in much the same way as religious communities.the popularization of mindfulness as a ""commodity"" has been criticized, being termed ""mcmindfulness"" by some critics. according to safran, the popularity of mindfulness is the result of a marketing strategy:""mcmindfulness is the marketing of a constructed dream; an idealized lifestyle; an identity makeover."" the psychologist thomas joiner argues that modern mindfulness meditation has been ""corrupted"" for commercial gain by self-help celebrities, and suggests that it encourages unhealthy narcissistic and self-obsessed mindsets.according to purser and loy, mindfulness is not being used as a means to awaken to insight in the ""unwholesome roots of greed, ill will and delusion,"" but reshaped into a ""banal, therapeutic, self-help technique"" that has the opposite effect of reinforcing those passions. while mindfulness is marketed as a means to reduce stress, in a buddhist context it is part of an all-embracing ethical program to foster ""wise action, social harmony, and compassion."" the privatization of mindfulness neglects the societal and organizational causes of stress and discomfort, instead propagating adaptation to these circumstances. according to bhikkhu bodhi, ""bsent a sharp social critique, buddhist practices could easily be used to justify and stabilize the status quo, becoming a reinforcement of consumer capitalism."" the popularity of this new brand of mindfulness has resulted in the commercialization of meditation through self-help books, guided meditation classes, and mindfulness retreats. mindfulness is said to be a $4bn industry. more than 60,000 books for sale on amazon have a variant of \x80\x9d in their title, touting the benefits of mindful parenting, mindful eating, mindful teaching, mindful therapy, mindful leadership, mindful finance, a mindful nation, and mindful dog owners, to name just a few.buddhist commentators have criticized the movement as being presented as equivalent to buddhist practice, while in reality it is very possibly denatured with undesirable consequences, such as being ungrounded in the traditional reflective morality and therefore, astray from traditional buddhist ethics. criticisms suggest it to be either de-moralized or re-moralized into clinically based ethics. the conflict is often presented in concern to the teachers credentials and qualifications, rather than the students actual practice. reformed buddhist-influenced practices are being standardized and manualized in a clearly distinct separation from buddhism seen as a religion based in monastic temples, as expressed as mindfulness in a new psychology ethic practiced in modern meditation centers.in media reports, people have attributed unexpected effects of increasing fear and anxiety, panic or ""meltdowns"" after practicing, which they suggest could expose bipolar vulnerability or repressed ptsd symptoms. however, according to published peer-reviewed academic articles, these negative effects of meditation are rare for mindfulness meditation, and appear to happen due to a poor understanding of what actually constitutes mindfulness/meditation practices.",1,0
"coordinates: 51957.529.147504750the parliament of the united kingdom is the supreme legislative body of the united kingdom, the crown dependencies and the british overseas territories.  it alone possesses legislative supremacy and thereby ultimate power over all other political bodies in the uk and the overseas territories. parliament is bicameral but has three parts, consisting of the sovereign  the two houses meet in the palace of westminster in the city of westminster, one of the inner boroughs of the capital city, london.the house of lords includes two different types of members: the lords spiritual, consisting of the most senior bishops of the church of england; and the lords temporal, consisting mainly of life peers, appointed by the sovereign, and of 92 hereditary peers, sitting either by virtue of holding a royal office, or by being elected by their fellow hereditary peers. prior to the opening of the supreme court in october 2009, the house of lords also performed a judicial role through the law lords.the house of commons is an elected chamber with elections to 650 single member constituencies held at least every five years under the first-past-the-post system. the two houses meet in separate chambers in the palace of westminster. by constitutional convention, all government ministers, including the prime minister, are members of the house of commons or, less commonly, the house of lords and are thereby accountable to the respective branches of the legislature. most cabinet ministers are from the commons, whilst junior ministers can be from either house. with the global expansion of the british empire, the uk parliament has shaped the political systems of many countries as ex-colonies and so it has been called the ""mother of parliaments.""in theory, the uks supreme legislative power is officially vested in the crown-in-parliament. however, the crown normally acts on the advice of the prime minister, and the powers of the house of lords are limited to only delaying legislation; thus power is de facto vested in the house of commons.the parliament of great britain was formed in 1707 following the ratification of the treaty of union by acts of union passed by the parliament of england  five years after the secession of the irish free state.the united kingdom of great britain and ireland was created on 1 january 1801, by the merger of the kingdoms of great britain and ireland under the acts of union 1800. the principle of ministerial responsibility to the lower house did not develop until the 19th century0 created the parliaments of northern ireland and southern ireland and reduced the representation of both parts at westminster. the number of northern ireland seats was increased again after the introduction of direct rule in 1973. the irish free state became independent in 1922, and in 1927 parliament was renamed the parliament of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland.further reforms to the house of lords were made in the 20th century. the life peerages act 1958 authorised the regular creation of life peerage dignities. by the 1960s, the regular creation of hereditary peerage dignities had ceased; thereafter, almost all new peers were life peers only.the house of lords act 1999 removed the automatic right of hereditary peers to sit in the house of lords, although it made an exception for 92 of them to be elected to life-terms by the other hereditary peers, with by-elections upon their death. the house of lords is now a chamber that is subordinate to the house of commons. additionally, the constitutional reform act 2005 led to abolition of the judicial functions of the house of lords with the creation of the new supreme court of the united kingdom in october 2009.the legislative authority, the crown-in-parliament, has three separate elements: the monarch, the house of lords, and the house of commons. no individual may be a member of both houses, and members of the house of lords are legally barred from voting in elections for members of the house of commons. formerly, no-one could be a member of parliament while holding an office of profit under the crown, thus maintaining the separation of powers, but the principle has been gradually eroded. until 1919, members of parliament who were appointed to ministerial office lost their seats in the house of commons and had to seek re-election; the rule was abolished in 1926. holders of offices are ineligible to serve as a member of parliament under the house of commons disqualification act 1975.royal assent of the monarch is required for all bills to become law, and certain delegated legislation must be made by the monarch by order in council. the crown also has executive powers which do not depend on parliament, through prerogative powers, including the power to make treaties, declare war, award honours, and appoint officers and civil servants. in practice these are always exercised by the monarch on the advice of the prime minister and the other ministers of hm government. the prime minister and government are directly accountable to parliament, through its control of public finances, and to the public, through the election of members of parliament.the monarch also appoints the prime minister, who then forms a government from members of the houses of parliament. this must be someone who could command a majority in a confidence vote in the house of commons. in the past the monarch has occasionally had to make a judgement, as in the appointment of alec douglas-home in 1963 when it was thought that the incumbent prime minister, harold macmillan, had become ill with terminal cancer. however, today the monarch is advised by the outgoing prime minister as to whom he or she should offer the position to next.the house of lords is known formally as, ""the right honourable the lords spiritual and temporal in parliament assembled,"" the lords spiritual being bishops of the church of england and the lords temporal being peers of the realm. the lords spiritual and lords temporal are considered separate ""estates,"" but they sit, debate and vote together.since the parliament acts 1911 and 1949, the powers of the house of lords have been very much less than those of the house of commons. all bills except money bills are debated and voted upon in the house of lords; however, by voting against a bill, the house of lords can only delay it for a maximum of two parliamentary sessions over a year. after that time, the house of commons can force the bill through without the lords consent, under the parliament acts. the house of lords can also hold the government to account through questions to government ministers and the operation of a small number of select committees. the highest court in england & wales and in northern ireland used to be a committee of the house of lords, but it became an independent supreme court in 2009.the lords spiritual formerly included all of the senior clergymen of the church of england6 most senior are lords spiritual. these always include the incumbents of the ""five great sees,"" namely the archbishop of canterbury, the archbishop of york, the bishop of london, the bishop of durham and the bishop of winchester. the remaining 21 lords spiritual are the most senior diocesan bishops, ranked in order of consecration, although the lords spiritual  as of 2019, the house consists of 650 members, however one seat is left vacant by the speaker of the house, who must remain politically impartial, and so does not get a vote on the passing of bills. each member of parliament  or, in a general election year, when the new parliament first assembled. from 2012 onwards, the ceremony has taken place in may or june.upon the signal of the monarch, the lord great chamberlain raises their wand of office to signal to black rod, who is charged with summoning the house of commons and has been waiting in the commons lobby. black rod turns and, under the escort of the door-keeper of the house of lords and an inspector of police, approaches the doors to the chamber of the commons. in 1642, king charles i stormed into the house of commons in an unsuccessful attempt to arrest the five members, who included the celebrated english patriot and leading parliamentarian john hampden. this action sparked the english civil war. the wars established the constitutional rights of parliament, a concept legally established in the glorious revolution in 1688 and the subsequent bill of rights 1689. since then, no british monarch has entered the house of commons when it is in session. on black rods approach, the doors are slammed shut against them, symbolising the rights of parliament and its independence from the monarch. they then strike, with the end of their ceremonial staff the monarch reads a speech, known as the speech from the throne, which is prepared by the prime minister and the cabinet, outlining the governments agenda for the coming year. the speech reflects the legislative agenda for which the government intends to seek the agreement of both houses of parliament.after the monarch leaves, each chamber proceeds to the consideration of an ""address in reply to her majestys gracious speech."" but, first, each house considers a bill pro forma to symbolise their right to deliberate independently of the monarch. in the house of lords, the bill is called the select vestries bill, while the commons equivalent is the outlawries bill. the bills are considered for the sake of form only, and do not make any actual progress.both houses of the british parliament are presided over by a speaker, the speaker of the house for the commons and the lord speaker in the house of lords.for the commons, the approval of the sovereign is theoretically required before the election of the speaker becomes valid, but it is, by modern convention, always granted. the speakers place may be taken by the chairman of ways and means, the first deputy chairman, or the second deputy chairman. even before the passage of the parliament acts, the commons possessed pre-eminence in cases of financial matters. by ancient custom, the house of lords may not introduce a bill relating to taxation or supply, nor amend a bill so as to insert a provision relating to taxation or supply, nor amend a supply bill in any way. the house of commons is free to waive this privilege, and sometimes does so to allow the house of lords to pass amendments with financial implications. the house of lords remains free to reject bills relating to supply and taxation, but may be over-ruled easily if the bills are money bills.  most excellent majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords spiritual and temporal, and commons, in this present parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:-,"" or, where the house of lords authority has been over-ridden by use of the parliament acts, the words ""be it enacted by the queens  most excellent majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the commons in this present parliament assembled, in accordance with the provisions of the parliament acts 1911 and 1949, and by the authority of the same, as follows:-"" appear near the beginning of each act of parliament. these words are known as the enacting formula.prior to the creation of the supreme court of the united kingdom in 2009, parliament was the highest court in the realm for most purposes, but the privy council had jurisdiction in some cases  as wales is developing its own judicature, it is likely that the same principle will be applied.certain other judicial functions have historically been performed by the house of lords. until 1948, it was the body in which peers had to be tried for felonies or high treason; now, they are tried by normal juries. the last occasion of the trial of a peer in the house of lords was in 1935. when the house of commons impeaches an individual, the trial takes place in the house of lords. impeachments are now possibly defunct, as the last one occurred in 1806. in 2006, a number of mps attempted to revive the custom, having signed a motion for the impeachment of tony blair, but this was unsuccessful.the british government is answerable to the house of commons. however, neither the prime minister nor members of the government are elected by the house of commons. instead, the queen requests the person most likely to command the support of a majority in the house, normally the leader of the largest party in the house of commons, to form a government. so that they may be accountable to the lower house, the prime minister and most members of the cabinet are, by convention, members of the house of commons. the last prime minister to be a member of the house of lords was alec douglas-home, 14th earl of home, who became prime minister in 1963. to adhere to the convention under which he was responsible to the lower house, he disclaimed his peerage and procured election to the house of commons within days of becoming prime minister.governments have a tendency to dominate the legislative functions of parliament, by using their in-built majority in the house of commons, and sometimes using their patronage power to appoint supportive peers in the lords. in practice, governments can pass any legislation  confidence in her majestys government"" but several other varieties, many referring to specific policies supported or opposed by parliament, are used. for instance, a confidence motion of 1992 used the form, ""that this house expresses the support for the economic policy of her majestys government."" such a motion may theoretically be introduced in the house of lords, but, as the government need not enjoy the confidence of that house, would not be of the same effect as a similar motion in the house of commons; the only modern instance of such an occurrence involves the no confidence motion that was introduced in 1993 and subsequently defeated.many votes are considered votes of confidence, although not including the language mentioned above. important bills that form part of the governments agenda  since the first-past-the-post electoral system is employed in elections, the governing party tends to enjoy a large majority in the commons; there is often limited need to compromise with other parties. modern british political parties are so tightly organised that they leave relatively little room for free action by their mps. in many cases, mps may be expelled from their parties for voting against the instructions of party leaders. during the 20th century, the government has lost confidence issues only three times4, and once in 1979.in the united kingdom, question time in the house of commons lasts for an hour each day from monday to thursday  additionally, each member of parliament is entitled to table questions for written answer. written questions are addressed to the ministerial head of a government department, usually a secretary of state, but they are often answered by a minister of state or parliamentary under secretary of state. written questions are submitted to the clerks of the table office, either on paper or electronically, and answers are recorded in the official report in the house of lords, a half-hour is set aside each afternoon at the start of the days proceedings for lords oral questions. a peer submits a question in advance, which then appears on the order paper for the days proceedings. the peer shall say: ""my lords, i beg leave to ask the question standing in my name on the order paper."" the minister responsible then answers the question. the peer is then allowed to ask a supplementary question and other peers ask further questions on the theme of the original put down on the order paper. several different views have been taken of parliaments sovereignty. according to the jurist sir william blackstone, ""it has sovereign and uncontrollable authority in making, confirming, enlarging, restraining, abrogating, repealing, reviving, and expounding of laws, concerning matters of all possible denominations, ecclesiastical, or temporal, civil, military, maritime, or criminal ... it can, in short, do every thing that is not naturally impossible.""a different view has been taken by the scottish judge thomas cooper, 1st lord cooper of culross. when he decided the 1953 case of maccormick v. lord advocate as lord president of the court of session, he stated, ""the principle of unlimited sovereignty of parliament is a distinctively english principle and has no counterpart in scottish constitutional law."" he continued, ""considering that the union legislation extinguished the parliaments of scotland and england and replaced them by a new parliament, i have difficulty in seeing why the new parliament of great britain must inherit all the peculiar characteristics of the english parliament but none of the scottish."" nevertheless, he did not give a conclusive opinion on the subject.thus, the question of parliamentary sovereignty appears to remain unresolved. parliament has not passed any act defining its own sovereignty. the european union  a related possible limitation on parliament relates to the scottish legal system and presbyterian faith, preservation of which were scottish preconditions to the creation of the unified parliament. since the parliament of the united kingdom was set up in reliance on these promises, it may be that it has no power to make laws that break them.parliaments power has often been eroded by its own acts. acts passed in 1921 and 1925 granted the church of scotland complete independence in ecclesiastical matters. from 1973 to 2020, its power had been restricted by membership of the european union, which has the power to make laws enforceable in each member state. in the factortame case, the european court of justice ruled that british courts could have powers to overturn british legislation contravening european law.parliament has also created national devolved parliaments and assemblies with differing degrees of legislative authority in scotland, wales and northern ireland. parliament still has the power over areas for which responsibility lies with the devolved institutions, but would ordinarily gain the agreement of those institutions to act on their behalf. similarly, it has granted the power to make regulations to ministers of the crown, and the power to enact religious legislation to the general synod of the church of england.  members of both houses are no longer privileged from service on juries.both houses possess the power to punish breaches of their privilege. contempt of parliament015, members of the house of commons also had the privilege of a separate seating area in the palace of westminster canteen, protected by a false partition labelled ""mps only beyond this point,"" so that they did not have to sit with canteen staff taking a break. this provoked mockery from a newly elected 20-year-old mp who described it as ""ridiculous"" snobbery.the quasi-official emblem of the houses of parliament is a crowned portcullis. the portcullis was originally the badge of various english noble families from the 14th century. it went on to be adopted by the kings of the tudor dynasty in the 16th century, under whom the palace of westminster became the regular meeting place of parliament. the crown was added to make the badge a specifically royal symbol.the portcullis probably first came to be associated with the palace of westminster through its use as decoration in the rebuilding of the palace after the fire of 1512. however, at the time it was only one of many symbols. the widespread use of the portcullis throughout the palace dates from the 19th century, when charles barry and augustus pugin used it extensively as a decorative feature in their designs for the new palace built following the disastrous 1834 fire.the crowned portcullis came to be accepted during the 20th century as the emblem of both houses of parliament. this was simply a result of custom and usage rather than a specific decision. the emblem now appears on official stationery, publications and papers, and is stamped on various items in use in the palace of westminster, such as cutlery, silverware and china. various shades of red and green are used for visual identification of the house of lords and the house of commons.uk parliament debates can be viewed in the related youtube channel. they are also broadcast live by the independent euronews english channel. in the uk the bbc has its own dedicated parliament

"baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two opposing teams who take turns batting and fielding. the game proceeds when a player on the fielding team, called the pitcher, throws a ball which a player on the batting team tries to hit with a bat. the objective of the offensive team  a run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate  one team70-degree area outside them is foul territory. the part of the field enclosed by the bases and several yards beyond them is the infield; the area farther beyond the infield is the outfield. in the middle of the infield is a raised pitchers mound, with a rectangular rubber plate there are three basic tools of baseball: the ball, the bat, and the glove or mitt:protective helmets are also standard equipment for all batters.at the beginning of each half-inning, the nine players of the fielding team arrange themselves around the field. one of them, the pitcher, stands on the pitchers mound. the pitcher begins the pitching delivery with one foot on the rubber, pushing off it to gain velocity when throwing toward home plate. another fielding team player, the catcher, squats on the far side of home plate, facing the pitcher. the rest of the fielding team faces home plate, typically arranged as four infielders30. that year also saw the founding of the negro national league; the first significant negro league, it would operate until 1931. for part of the 1920s, it was joined by the eastern colored league.compared with the present, professional baseball in the early 20th century was lower-scoring, and pitchers were more dominant. the so-called dead-ball era ended in the early 1920s with several changes in rule and circumstance that were advantageous to hitters. strict new regulations governed the balls size, shape and composition, along with a new rule officially banning the spitball and other pitches that depended on the ball being treated or roughed-up with foreign substances, resulted in a ball that traveled farther when hit. the rise of the legendary player babe ruth, the first great power hitter of the new era, helped permanently alter the nature of the game. in the late 1920s and early 1930s, st. louis cardinals general manager branch rickey invested in several minor league clubs and developed the first modern farm system. a new negro national league was organized in 1933; four years later, it was joined by the negro american league. the first elections to the national baseball hall of fame took place in 1936. in 1939, little league baseball was founded in pennsylvania.a large number of minor league teams disbanded when world war ii led to a player shortage. chicago cubs owner philip k. wrigley led the formation of the all-american girls professional baseball league to help keep the game in the public eye. the first crack in the unwritten agreement barring blacks from white-controlled professional ball occurred in 1945: jackie robinson was signed by the national leagues brooklyn dodgers and began playing for their minor league team in montreal. in 1947, robinson broke the major leagues color barrier when he debuted with the dodgers. latin american players, largely overlooked before, also started entering the majors in greater numbers. in 1951, two chicago white sox, venezuelan-born chico carrasquel and black cuban-born minnie mi000, the national and american leagues were dissolved as legal entities. while their identities were maintained for scheduling purposes in 2001, barry bonds established the current record of 73 home runs in a single season. there had long been suspicions that the dramatic increase in power hitting was fueled in large part by the abuse of illegal steroids  in 2007, bonds became mlbs all-time home run leader, surpassing hank aaron, as total major league and minor league attendance both reached all-time highs.widely known as americas pastime, baseball is well established in several other countries as well. as early as 1877, a professional league, the international association, featured teams from both canada and the us. while baseball is widely played in canada and many minor league teams have been based in the country, the american major leagues did not include a canadian club until 1969, when the montreal expos joined the national league as an expansion team. in 1977, the expansion toronto blue jays joined the american league.in 1847, american soldiers played what may have been the first baseball game in mexico at parque los berros in xalapa, veracruz. the first formal baseball league outside of the united states and canada was founded in 1878 in cuba, which maintains a rich baseball tradition. the dominican republic held its first islandwide championship tournament in 1912. professional baseball tournaments and leagues began to form in other countries between the world wars, including the netherlands  the japanese major leagues have long been considered the highest quality professional circuits outside of the united states.after world war ii, professional leagues were founded in many latin american countries, most prominently venezuela  since the early 1970s, the annual caribbean series has matched the championship clubs from the four leading latin american winter leagues: the dominican professional baseball league, mexican pacific league, puerto rican professional baseball league, and venezuelan professional baseball league. in asia, south korea many european countries have professional leagues as well; the most successful, other than the dutch league, is the italian league, founded in 1948. in 2004, australia won a surprise silver medal at the olympic games. the conf games, baseball was dropped from the 2012 summer olympic games at the 2005 international olympic committee meeting. it remained part of the 2008 games. while the sports lack of a following in much of the world was a factor, more important was mlbs reluctance to allow its players to participate during the major league season. mlb initiated the world baseball classic, scheduled to precede its season, partly as a replacement, high-profile international tournament. the inaugural classic, held in march 2006, was the first tournament involving national teams to feature a significant number of mlb participants. the baseball world cup was discontinued after its 2011 edition in favor of an expanded world baseball classic.baseball has certain attributes that set it apart from the other popular team sports in the countries where it has a following. all of these sports use a clock, play is less individual, and the variation between playing fields is not as substantial or important. the comparison between cricket and baseball demonstrates that many of baseballs distinctive elements are shared in various ways with its cousin sports.in clock-limited sports, games often end with a team that holds the lead killing the clock rather than competing aggressively against the opposing team. in contrast, baseball has no clock, thus a team cannot win without getting the last batter out and rallies are not constrained by time. at almost any turn in any baseball game, the most advantageous strategy is some form of aggressive strategy. whereas, in the case of multi-day test and first-class cricket, the possibility of a draw  often encourages a team that is batting last and well behind, to bat defensively and run out the clock, giving up any faint chance at a win, to avoid an overall loss.while nine innings has been the standard since the beginning of professional baseball, the duration of the average major league game has increased steadily through the years. at the turn of the 20th century, games typically took an hour and a half to play. in the 1920s, they averaged just less than two hours, which eventually ballooned to 2:38 in 1960. by 1997, the average american league game lasted 2:57  in 2004, major league baseball declared that its goal was an average game of 2:45. by 2014, though, the average mlb game took over three hours to complete. the lengthening of games is attributed to longer breaks between half-innings for television commercials, increased offense, more pitching changes, and a slower pace of play with pitchers taking more time between each delivery, and batters stepping out of the box more frequently. other leagues have experienced similar issues. in 2008, nippon professional baseball took steps aimed at shortening games by 12 minutes from the preceding decades average of 3:18.in 2016, the average nine-inning playoff game in major league baseball was 3 hours and 35 minutes. this was up 10 minutes from 2015 and 21 minutes from 2014.although baseball is a team sport, individual players are often placed under scrutiny and pressure. in 1915, a baseball instructional manual pointed out that every single pitch, of which there are often more than two hundred in a game, involves an individual, one-on-one contest: ""the pitcher and the batter in a battle of wits"". pitcher, batter, and fielder all act essentially independent of each other. while coaching staffs can signal pitcher or batter to pursue certain tactics, the execution of the play itself is a series of solitary acts. if the batter hits a line drive, the outfielder is solely responsible for deciding to try to catch it or play it on the bounce and for succeeding or failing. the statistical precision of baseball is both facilitated by this isolation and reinforces it.cricket is more similar to baseball than many other team sports in this regard: while the individual focus in cricket is mitigated by the importance of the batting partnership and the practicalities of tandem running, it is enhanced by the fact that a batsman may occupy the wicket for an hour or much more. there is no statistical equivalent in cricket for the fielding error and thus less emphasis on personal responsibility in this area of play.unlike those of most sports, baseball playing fields can vary significantly in size and shape. while the dimensions of the infield are specifically regulated, the only constraint on outfield size and shape for professional teams, following the rules of mlb and minor league baseball, is that fields built or remodeled since june 1, 1958, must have a minimum distance of 325 feet  major league teams often skirt even this rule. for example, at minute maid park, which became the home of the houston astros in 2000, the crawford boxes in left field are only 315 feet  there are no rules at all that address the height of fences or other structures at the edge of the outfield. the most famously idiosyncratic outfield boundary is the left-field wall at bostons fenway park, in use since 1912: the green monster is 310 feet similarly, there are no regulations at all concerning the dimensions of foul territory. thus a foul fly ball may be entirely out of play in a park with little space between the foul lines and the stands, but a foulout in a park with more expansive foul ground. a fence in foul territory that is close to the outfield line will tend to direct balls that strike it back toward the fielders, while one that is farther away may actually prompt more collisions, as outfielders run full speed to field balls deep in the corner. these variations can make the difference between a double and a triple or inside-the-park home run. the surface of the field is also unregulated. while the adjacent image shows a traditional field surfacing arrangement  some fields82 feet  wrigley field, home of the chicago cubs, is known for its fickle disposition: a hitters park when the strong winds off lake michigan are blowing out, it becomes more of a pitchers park when they are blowing in. the absence of a standardized field affects not only how particular games play out, but the nature of team rosters and players statistical records. for example, hitting a fly ball 330 feet organized baseball lends itself to statistics to a greater degree than many other sports. each play is discrete and has a relatively small number of possible outcomes. in the late 19th century, a former cricket player, english-born henry chadwick of brooklyn, was responsible for the ""development of the box score, tabular standings, the annual baseball guide, the batting average, and most of the common statistics and tables used to describe baseball."" the statistical record is so central to the games ""historical essence"" that chadwick came to be known as father baseball. in the 1920s, american newspapers began devoting more and more attention to baseball statistics, initiating what journalist and historian alan schwarz describes as a ""tectonic shift in sports, as intrigue that once focused mostly on teams began to go to individual players and their statistics lines.""the official baseball rules administered by mlb require the official scorer to categorize each baseball play unambiguously. the rules provide detailed criteria to promote consistency. the score report is the official basis for both the box score of the game and the relevant statistical records. general managers, managers, and baseball scouts use statistics to evaluate players and make strategic decisions.certain traditional statistics are familiar to most baseball fans. the basic batting statistics include:the basic baserunning statistics include:the basic pitching statistics include:the basic fielding statistics include:among the many other statistics that are kept are those collectively known as situational statistics. for example, statistics can indicate which specific pitchers a certain batter performs best against. if a given situation statistically favors a certain batter, the manager of the fielding team may be more likely to change pitchers or have the pitcher intentionally walk the batter in order to face one who is less likely to succeed.sabermetrics refers to the field of baseball statistical study and the development of new statistics and analytical tools. the term is also used to refer directly to new statistics themselves. the term was coined around 1980 by one of the fields leading proponents, bill james, and derives from the society for american baseball research the growing popularity of sabermetrics since the early 1980s has brought more attention to two batting statistics that sabermetricians argue are much better gauges of a batters skill than batting average:some of the new statistics devised by sabermetricians have gained wide use:writing in 1919, philosopher morris raphael cohen described baseball as americas national religion. in the words of sports columnist jayson stark, baseball has long been ""a unique paragon of american culture""017, 83 of the 868 players on mlb opening day rosters  hall-of-famer roberto clemente remains one of the greatest national heroes in puerto ricos history. while baseball has long been the islands primary athletic pastime, its once well-attended professional winter league has declined in popularity since 1990, when young puerto rican players began to be included in the major leagues annual first-year player draft. in asia, baseball is among the most popular sports in japan and south korea.the major league game in the united states was originally targeted toward a middle-class, white-collar audience: relative to other spectator pastimes, the national leagues set ticket price of 50 cents in 1876 was high, while the location of playing fields outside the inner city and the workweek daytime scheduling of games were also obstacles to a blue-collar audience. a century later, the situation was very different. with the rise in popularity of other team sports with much higher average ticket prices006 poll found that nearly half of americans are fans. in the late 1900s and early 2000s, baseballs position compared to football in the united states moved in contradictory directions. in 2008, mlb set a revenue record of $6.5017. on the other hand, the percentage of american sports fans polled who named baseball as their favorite sport was 9%, compared to pro football at 37%. in 1985, the respective figures were pro football 24%, baseball 23%. because there are so many more major league games played, there is no comparison in overall attendance. in 2008, total attendance at major league games was the second-highest in history: 78.6008, with 43.3018, little league baseball oversees leagues with close to 2.4015, nearly half a million high schoolers and over 34,000 collegians

items by tobacco and confectionery companies. the 1930s saw the popularization of the modern style of baseball card, with a player photograph accompanied on the rear by statistics and biographical

"denim is a sturdy cotton warp-faced textile in which the weft passes under two or more warp threads. this twill weaving produces a diagonal ribbing that distinguishes it from cotton duck. while a denim predecessor known as dungaree has been produced in india for hundreds of years, denim itself was first produced in the french city of n0th century denim was used for cheap durable uniforms like those issued to staff of the french national railways. in the postwar years, royal air force overalls for dirty work were named ""denims"". these were a one-piece garment, with long legs and sleeves, buttoned from throat to crotch, in an olive drab denim fabric.all denim is created through generally the same process:most denim yarn is composed entirely of cotton. some denim yarn may use an elastic component such as spandex for up to 3% of the content to allow the final woven product to stretch. even such a small amount of spandex enables a stretching capacity of about 15%.denim was originally dyed with indigo dye extracted from plants, often from the genus indigofera. in south asia, indigo dye was extracted from the dried and fermented leaves of indigofera tinctoria; this is the plant that is now known as ""true indigo"" or ""natural indigo"". in europe, use of isatis tinctoria, or woad, can be traced back to the 8th century bc, although it was eventually replaced by indigofera tinctoria as the superior dye product. however, most denim today is dyed with synthetic indigo dye. in all cases, the yarn undergoes a repeated sequence of dipping and oxidation  oz, with 11 to 14 oz being typical.particularly with denim jeans, a significant amount of the aesthetic treatment of denim occurs after the denim has been cut and sewn into the final garment.skinny jeans made from red denima miniskirt made from purple denimjeans made from light grey denimmany denim articles are washed to make them softer and to reduce or minimize shrinkage even beyond what sanforization prevents. significantly washed denim can resemble dry denim which has faded naturally over extended use. such distressing may be supplemented by chemical treatments or physical techniques such as stone washing.over time dry denim will fade, considered fashionable in some circumstances. during the process of wear, fading will usually occur on those parts of the article that receive the most stress. on a pair of jeans, this includes the upper thighs, the ankles, and the areas behind the knees.to facilitate the natural distressing process, some wearers of dry denim will abstain from washing their jeans for more than six months.most dry denim is made with 100% cotton and comes from several different countries. patterns of fading in jeans caused by prolonged periods of wearing them without washing are a way of ""personalizing"" the garment. such patterns include:as jeans grew in popularity in the early 1970s, ""one of the most creative carmakers of the era, amc, took note."" starting with the 1973 model year, american motors  american motors had an objective of offering fashion interiors for its cars and the levis trim was ""designed to appeal to young men and women who enjoy the casual look in clothes and cars. over the years it was available on the gremlin, hornet, and pacer.although the cars jean material looks just like the real thing, amc used spun nylon that was made to imitate denim. this was because real denim fabric is not tough enough for automobile use and cannot pass fire resistance safety standards. the copper rivets were the actual versions and the seat design included traditional contrasting stitching with the levis tab on both the front seat backs. the option also included unique door panels with levis trim and removable map pockets, as well as ""levis"" decal identification on the front fenders. the levis trim package option was $134.95, but only $49.95 extra if ordered together with the ""gremlin x"" appearance option. the levis interior upholstery was available through the 1978 model year amc gremlin. it has become one of the best-known options on the gremlins.a levis trim package was also available by amc on most jeeps, including the cj series, the full-size cherokee  this consisted of denim-colored-and-textured vinyl upholstery and a matching canvas top. this option was available on all cj models in blue or tan, and was the standard trim on the top-level renegade versions. the levis association was removed in later years with the upholstery trim named ""denim vinyl"" through 1980.between 1973 and 1975 volkswagen produced the jeans beetle, which had denim interior trim and special exterior graphics for sale in europe. this concept was repeated in some later models.british artist ian berry has been making art with only denim for well over a decade. and is famed around the world for his photorealistic pieces all hand cut out of only denim of portraits and scenes. he has made pieces of ayrton senna, giorgio armani, lapo elkann, debbie harry, jenifer saunders, eunice olumbide obe among others. in 2013, he was named as one of the top 30 artists under 30 in the world by art business news.many everyday people from around the world have taken to creating art on their denim, often using fabric paint or acrylic to add a personal touch and express themselves further in their clothing.in 2007, the worldwide denim market equalled us$51.6 billion, with demand growing by 5% and supply growing by 8% annually. over 50% of denim is produced in asia, most of it in china, india, turkey, pakistan, and bangladesh.globally, the denim industry is expected to grow at a cagr of over 6.5% during 2015 to 2020, with the market value expected to increase from $113 billion to $153 billion.the following table shows where the worlds denim mills are located.",1,0

"sangrita (meaning ""little blood"", whose origin dates back to the 1920s, is a customary partner to a shot of straight tequila blanco; a non-alcoholic accompaniment that highlights tequilas crisp acidity and cleanses the palate between each peppery sip. the basic conception of sangrita is to complement the flavor of 100% agave tequila, which is also peppery and citrusy in taste. before increased worldwide popularity and corporate interest in tequila in the late 1990s and early 21st century, few outside of the mexican pacific region bordering the state of jalisco, where tequila was mainly produced and consumed, knew of the existence of sangrita, and much less its recipe. as popularity grew, so did commercial efforts to recreate the mysterious red, spicy drink that was served with tequila. in fact the drink was not that mysterious. while most outsiders would reference its red make up as tomato juice and spices, locals and traditionalists agree that the one ingredient that most likely doesnt belong is tomato.a popular recipe in guadalajara (jaliscos largest city was said to have originated from the leftover juices (mainly orange of an equally popular regional fruit salad covered with fine chilli powder, usually piquin. as the fruit salad, known to jalisquillos (guadalajaras natives as pico de gallo, was consumed from a large bowl during breakfast, the remaining juice was saved and poured on a small and narrow clay cup, which itself would be the precursor of the tequila shot glass. in essence, the recipe of the original sangrita is thought to be that and the same recipe of the fruit salad from which it was strained. in almost all cases the drink took its bright red color from a mix of the fine pepper powder, spices, and pomegranate, while the base was mainly orange or sweetened lime juice. the key to a balanced sangrita recipe can be found in the fruit salads recipes, which would have included any or all of the following: tangerine, cucumber, papaya, mango and jicama.traditionally, sangrita is served with tequila blanco, but it can also accompany tequila reposado. the tequila and sangrita are each poured into a separate shot glass (or caballito and the two are alternately sipped, not chased. sangrita is used in a drink known as ""the mexican flag"", where three separate double shot glasses are filled with lime juice, tequila and sangrita.authentic sangrita from the lake chapala region of jalisco is made with seville orange, lime and pomegranate juices, with chili powder or hot sauce added for heat. however, most modern sangrita recipes (particularly outside of jalisco have mistakenly attributed the red appearance of the drink to tomato juice instead of the chile powder. while some would argue that there is no set rule on what sangrita should contain, as the main ingredient, it is commonly considered by older residents of jalisco that tomato and particularly branded recipes such as the ""clamato"" mix stem from uninformed efforts to recreate the drink due to its growing popularity. it can feature a blend of orange, lime, tomato and/or pomegranate juices, or pomegranate-based grenadine with the addition of something spicy (hot sauce or fresh/dried chili pepper, and sometimes white onion and salt.a variation on a basic traditional recipe:a basic tomato based recipe (non-traditionalmexico city style sangrita:",1,0
"in mathematics, topology homeomorphism can be considered the most basic topological equivalence. another is homotopy equivalence. this is harder to describe without getting technical, but the essential notion is that two objects are homotopy equivalent if they both result from ""squishing"" some larger object.an introductory exercise is to classify the uppercase letters of the english alphabet according to homeomorphism and homotopy equivalence. the result depends on the font used, and on whether the strokes making up the letters have some thickness or are ideal curves with no thickness.  the figures here use the sans-serif myriad font and are assumed to consist of ideal curves without thickness. homotopy equivalence is a coarser relationship than homeomorphism; a homotopy equivalence class can contain several homeomorphism classes. the simple case of homotopy equivalence described above can be used here to show two letters are homotopy equivalent. for example, o fits inside p and the tail of the p can be squished to the ""hole"" part.homeomorphism classes are:homotopy classes are larger, because the tails can be squished down to a point. they are:to classify the letters correctly, we must show that two letters in the same class are equivalent and two letters in different classes are not equivalent. in the case of homeomorphism, this can be done by selecting points and showing their removal disconnects the letters differently. for example, x and y are not homeomorphic because removing the center point of the x leaves four pieces; whatever point in y corresponds to this point, its removal can leave at most three pieces. the case of homotopy equivalence is harder and requires a more elaborate argument showing an algebraic invariant, such as the fundamental group, is different on the supposedly differing classes.letter topology has practical relevance in stencil typography. for instance, braggadocio font stencils are made of one connected piece of material.topology, as a well-defined mathematical discipline, originates in the early part of the twentieth century, but some isolated results can be traced back several centuries. among these are certain questions in geometry investigated by leonhard euler. his 1736 paper on the seven bridges of k e + f = 2 further contributions were made by augustin-louis cauchy, ludwig schl2 by kazimierz kuratowski.modern topology depends strongly on the ideas of set theory, developed by georg cantor in the later part of the 19th century. in addition to establishing the basic ideas of set theory, cantor considered point sets in euclidean space as part of his study of fourier series. for further developments, see point-set topology and algebraic topology.the term topology also refers to a specific mathematical idea central to the area of mathematics called topology. informally, a topology tells how elements of a set relate spatially to each other. the same set can have different topologies. for instance, the real line, the complex plane, and the cantor set can be thought of as the same set with different topologies.formally, let x be a set and let  dimensions \x80\x93 and the geometrization conjecture  while grothendieck topologies are structures defined on arbitrary categories that allow the definition of sheaves on those categories, and with that the definition of general cohomology theories.knot theory, a branch of topology, is used in biology to study the effects of certain enzymes on dna. these enzymes cut, twist, and reconnect the dna, causing knotting with observable effects such as slower electrophoresis. topology is also used in evolutionary biology to represent the relationship between phenotype and genotype. phenotypic forms that appear quite different can be separated by only a few mutations depending on how genetic changes map to phenotypic changes during development. in neuroscience, topological quantities like the euler characteristic and betti number have been used to measure the complexity of patterns of activity in neural networks.topological data analysis uses techniques from algebraic topology to determine the large scale structure of a set topology is relevant to physics in areas such as condensed matter physics, quantum field theory and physical cosmology.the topological dependence of mechanical properties in solids is of interest in disciplines of mechanical engineering and materials science. electrical and mechanical properties depend on the arrangement and network structures of molecules and elementary units in materials. the compressive strength of crumpled topologies is studied in attempts to understand the high strength to weight of such structures that are mostly empty space. topology is of further significance in contact mechanics where the dependence of stiffness and friction on the dimensionality of surface structures is the subject of interest with applications in multi-body physics.a topological quantum field theory in cosmology, topology can be used to describe the overall shape of the universe. this area of research is commonly known as spacetime topology.the possible positions of a robot can be described by a manifold called configuration space. in the area of motion planning, one finds paths between two points in configuration space. these paths represent a motion of the robots joints and other parts into the desired pose.tanglement puzzles are based on topological aspects of the puzzles shapes and components.in order to create a continuous join of pieces in a modular construction, it is necessary to create an unbroken path in an order which surrounds each piece and traverses each edge only once. this process is an application of the eulerian path.",1,0

bills intended to restrict abortions, including one that prohibited abortions if the reason for the procedure was the fetuss race, gender, or disability. after pence signed the religious freedom restoration act, he encountered fierce resistance from moderate members of his party, the business community, and lgbt advocates. the backlash against the rfra led pence to amend the bill to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender identity, and other criteria.pence withdrew his gubernatorial reelection campaign in july 2016 to become the running mate of republican presidential nominee donald trump, who went on to win the 2016 presidential election. he was inaugurated as vice president of the united states on january 20, 2017. as vice president, pence has chaired the national space council since it was reestablished in june 2017.  in february 2020, pence was appointed chairman of the white house coronavirus task force, which was established in response to the covid-19 pandemic in the united states.pence and trump lost their bid for re-election in the 2020 united states presidential election to joe biden and kamala harris, although the trump campaign has refused to concede and has filed unsubstantiated lawsuits in multiple states, alleging voter fraud, and has refused to cooperate with the transition.michael richard pence was born june 7, 1959, in columbus, indiana, one of six children of ann jane ""nancy""  who ran a group of gas stations. his father served in the u.s. army during the korean war and received the bronze star in 1953, which

university , pence began hosting a daily talk show on wrcr, the mike pence show, in addition to a saturday show on wnde in indianapolis. pence called himself ""rush limbaugh on decaf"" since he considered himself politically conservative while not as bombastic as limbaugh. beginning on april 11, 1994, network indiana syndicated the mike pence show statewide. with a 9:00000 campaign for congress, which he eventually won. from 1995 to 1999, pence hosted a weekend public affairs tv show also titled the mike pence show on indianapolis tv station wndy.pence rejuvenated his political career by running for the u.s. house of representatives again in 2000, this time winning the seat in indianas 2nd congressional district after six-year incumbent david m. mcintosh opted to run for governor of indiana. the district  while in congress, pence belonged to the tea party caucus.in his first year in office, pence opposed president george w. bushs no child left behind act in 2001, as well as president bushs medicare prescription drug expansion the following year. pence was re-elected four more times by comfortable margins. in the 2006, 2008, and 2010 house elections, he defeated democrat barry welsh.pence began to climb the party leadership structure and from 2005 to 2007 was chairman of the republican study committee, a group of conservative house republicans. in november 2006, pence announced his candidacy for leader of the republican party  pences release announcing his run for minority leader focused on a ""return to the values"" of the newt gingrich-headed 1994 republican revolution. however, he lost the bid to representative john boehner of ohio by a vote of 168 for boehner, 27 for pence, and one for representative joe barton of texas. in january 2009, pence was elected as the republican conference chairman, the third-highest-ranking republican leadership position at the time behind minority leader john boehner and republican whip eric cantor. he ran unopposed and was elected unanimously. he was the first representative from indiana to hold a house leadership position since 1981. during pences twelve years in the house, he introduced 90 bills and resolutions; none became law. his committee assignments in the house were the following:in 2008, esquire magazine listed pence as one of the ten best members of congress, writing that pences ""unalloyed traditional conservatism has repeatedly pitted him against his party elders"". pence was mentioned as a possible republican candidate for president in 2008 and 2012. in september 2010, he was the top choice for president in a straw poll conducted by the values voter summit. that same year he was encouraged to run against incumbent democratic senator evan bayh, but opted not to enter the race, even after bayh unexpectedly announced that he would retire.in may 2011, pence announced that he would be seeking the republican nomination for governor of indiana in 2012. incumbent republican governor mitch daniels was term-limited. pence ran on a platform that touted the successes of his predecessor and promised to continue educational reform and business deregulation of daniels. the democratic nominee was former indiana speaker of the house john r. gregg. despite strong name recognition and a popular outgoing governor of the same party, pence found himself in a heated race, eventually pulling out a close win with just under 50 percent of the vote, and less than 3% ahead of gregg, with libertarian nominee rupert boneham receiving most of the remaining votes.pence was sworn in as the 50th governor of indiana on january 14, 2013.pence ""inherited a $2014 with a reserve of $247014, indianas economy was among the slowest-growing in the united states, with 0.4 percent gdp growth, compared to the national average of 2.2 percent; this was attributed in part to a sluggish manufacturing sector. carrier corp. and united technologies electronic controls  and pence expressed ""deep disappointment"". pence was unsuccessful in his efforts to persuade the companies to stay in the state, although the companies agreed to reimburse local and state governments for certain tax incentives they had received. the indiana economic development corporation led by pence had approved $24016.in 2013, pence signed a law blocking local governments in indiana from requiring businesses to offer higher wages or benefits beyond those required by federal law. in 2015, pence also repealed an indiana law that required construction companies working on publicly funded projects to pay a prevailing wage. indiana enacted right-to-work legislation under pences predecessor, republican governor mitch daniels. under pence, the state successfully defended this legislation against a labor challenge. in 2013, pence also announced the formation of the indiana biosciences research institute, a life sciences research facility supported with $25013. while he did not get the ten percent cut he advocated, pence did accomplish his goal of cutting state taxes. legislators cut the income tax by five percent and also killed the inheritance tax. speaker of the house brian bosma said the legislative package was the ""largest tax cut in our states history, about $1.1021, which would be the second-lowest corporate income tax in the nation. the law also permitted indiana counties to eliminate the business personal property tax on new equipment and let them exempt small businesses with less than $20,000 worth of equipment from paying personal property taxes.on june 12, 2013, the indiana legislature overrode pences veto of a bill to retroactively authorize a local tax. lawmakers overrode pences veto in a 683 vote in the house and a 34 one in the senate. republican legislators overwhelmingly voted against pence, while most democrats supported his veto. the jackson015. the legislation passed the state senate. indiana has had aaa credit ratings with the three major credit-rating agencies since 2010, before pence took office; these ratings were maintained throughout pences tenure.in 2014, pence supported the indiana gateway project, a $71.4009  in october 2015, pence ""announced plans to pay off a $250016, pence signed legislation to fund a $230014, a little over one year after taking office, pence helped establish a $10-million state preschool pilot program in indiana and testified personally before the state senate education committee in favor of the program to convince fellow republicans  although the plan was initially defeated, pence successfully managed to revive it, ""getting indiana off the list of just 10 states that spent no direct funds to help poor children attend preschool"". demand for enrollment in the program ""far outstripped"" capacity, and pence at first refused to apply for up to $80015, pence secured significant increases in charter-school funding from the legislation, although he did not get everything he had proposed. legislation signed into law by pence in 2013 greatly increased the number of students in indiana who qualify for school vouchers, making it one of the largest voucher programs in the united states. the annual cost of the program is estimated to be $53015014 state of the state address. the indiana general assembly then passed a bill to repeal the standards, becoming the first state to do so. in a televised interview appearance with chris matthews, pence advocated eroding the teaching of science in public schools by putting religious dogma on a par with established science, accepting ""creationist beliefs"" as factual, and thus ""teaching the controversy"" over evolution and natural selection, and regarding the age of the earth, and letting children decide for themselves what to believe.despite successful advocacy for more funding for pre-schools, voucher programs, and charter schools, pence has frequently clashed with teachers unions and supporters of public schooling. in one of his first acts as governor, pence removed control of the educational employment relations board, which was in charge of handling conflicts between unions and school boards, from glenda ritz, a democrat who was the indiana superintendent of public instruction  pence created a new ""center for education and career innovation""  in may 2015, pence signed a bill stripping ritz of much of her authority over standardized testing and other education issues, and reconstituting the state board of education dominated by pence appointees. the bill also allowed the board to appoint a chairman other than the superintendent of public instruction starting in 2017, and added the state board of education  pence and ritz also clashed over non-binding federal guidelines that advised indiana public schools must treat transgender students in a way that corresponds to their gender identity, even if their education files indicate a different gender.during pences term in office, the republican-controlled indiana general assembly ""repeatedly tried to roll back renewable energy standards and successfully ended indianas energy efficiency efforts."" pence has been an outspoken supporter of the coal industry, declaring in his 2015 state of the state address that ""indiana is a pro-coal state,"" expressing support for an ""all-of-the-above energy strategy"", and stating: ""we must continue to oppose the overreaching schemes of the epa until we bring their war on coal to an end."" in 2015, pence sent a letter to president obama denouncing the epas clean power plan  indiana joined other states in a lawsuit seeking to invalidate the plan. in 2016, pence said that even if legal challenges failed, indiana would continue to defy the rule and would not come up with its own plan to reduce emissions.in 2014, over the opposition of indiana school organizations, pence signed a bill which allows firearms to be kept in vehicles on school property. in 2015, following a shooting in chattanooga, pence recruited the national rifle association to train the indiana national guard on concealed carry. some national guard officials from other states questioned why a civilian organization would be involved in a military issue. in may 2015, pence signed into law senate bill 98, which limited lawsuits against gun and ammunition manufacturers and sellers and retroactively terminated the city of garys still-pending 1999 lawsuit against gun manufacturers and retailers that allegedly made illegal sales of handguns. the bill was supported by republicans such as state senator jim tomes, who hoped the measure would attract more gun-related businesses to indiana, but opposed by gary mayor and former indiana attorney general karen freeman-wilson, who viewed the measure as ""an unprecedented violation of the separation of powers between the legislative and judicial branches of state government."" in 2016, pence signed senate bill 109 into law, legalizing the captive hunting of farm-raised deer in indiana.in 2009, parts of east chicago were discovered to have toxic lead and arsenic contamination, and were designated a superfund site. governor pence declined to declare the superfund site a state emergency; his successor governor eric holcomb has issued executive order 17014, there was an hiv outbreak in southern indiana. in 2011, planned parenthood  the republican-controlled legislature and pence defunded planned parenthood. scott county has been without an hiv testing center since 2013. pence had long been a vocal opponent of needle exchange programs, which allow drug users to trade in used syringes for sterile ones in order to stop the spread of diseases, despite solid scientific evidence that such programs prevent the spread of aids, hepatitis b  in march 2015, well after the outbreak began, pence finally allowed at least five counties to open needle exchanges, but did not move to lift the state ban on funding for needle exchanges. critics say pences compromise had been ineffective because counties had no way to pay for needle exchanges themselves. anesthesiologist jerome adams, then the pence-appointed indiana state health commissioner and now the trump-appointed surgeon general of the united states, defended pence, arguing that publicly funded needle exchange programs are controversial in many conservative communities. during his time as indiana state health commissioner, adams020 to head the countrys response to coronavirus, he touted his ostensible experience with quelling an epidemic of hiv in indiana, in which pence deliberately delayed his state governments response to the disease despite the recommendations of the centers for disease control that needle exchange was an efficacious approach to reining in the spread of diseases. pence had told lawmakers he would veto any bill they might pass that provided for such exchanges.in 2015, pence and the obama administration agreed to expand medicaid in indiana, in accordance with the affordable care act. as part of the expansion, called the healthy indiana plan 2.0, pence negotiated modifications to the program for indiana that included co-payments by participants. the co-payments are linked to healthy behaviors on the part of the participants so that, for example, a participant who quit smoking would receive a lower co-payment. participants can lose benefits for failing to make the payments. the required contribution would be about 2% of income. critics say those who already struggle to buy food and housing will have even more difficulty paying their 2%. one critic expressed concern that lower-income people may stay out of the program or avoid pursuing health care. a service provider said the program ""wins the award for bureaucratic complexity and red tape"". in early 2017, indiana submitted its application to the centers for medicare and medicaid services to renew healthy indiana, to show that the program was meeting its targets, as required for renewal. national public radio/side effects public media said the application used ""misleading and inaccurate information"".on march 26, 2015, pence signed indiana senate bill 101, also known as the indiana ""religious objections"" bill  the move was praised by religious conservatives, but criticized by people and groups who felt the law was carefully worded in a way that would permit discrimination against lgbt persons. such organizations as the national collegiate athletic association  angies list announced that they would cancel a $40015, wall street journal op-ed, ""if i saw a restaurant owner refuse to serve a gay couple, i wouldnt eat there anymore. as governor of indiana, if i were presented a bill that legalized discrimination against any person or group, i would veto it."" in the wake of the backlash against the rfra, on april 2, 2015, pence signed legislation revising the law to protect against potential discrimination. pence received heavy criticism from liberals at the time of signing the religious freedom law, who labeled him as anti-gay. in 2018, emails released to the associated press showed that conservatives had also opposed his changing the law.in march 2016, pence, as indiana governor, signed into law h.b. 1337, a bill that both banned certain abortion procedures and placed new restrictions on abortion providers. the bill banned abortion if the reason for the procedure given by the woman was the fetus race or gender or a fetal abnormality. in addition, the bill required that all fetal remains from abortions or miscarriages at any stage of pregnancy be buried or cremated, which according to the guttmacher institute was not required in any other state. the law was described as ""exceptional for its breadth""; if implemented, it would have made indiana ""the first state to have a blanket ban on abortions based solely on race, sex or suspected disabilities, including evidence of down syndrome"". days after the u.s. supreme court issued its decision in whole womans health v. hellerstedt, a federal court issued a preliminary injunction blocking the bill from taking effect, with u.s. district judge tanya walton pratt determining that the bill was likely to be unconstitutional and that the state of indiana would be unlikely to prevail at trial. the abortion bill was subsequently ruled unconstitutional in april 2018 by the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit.in june 2013, pence was criticized for deleting comments of others posted on his official government facebook page; he apologized.on january 26, 2015, it was widely reported that pence had planned to launch a state-run, taxpayer-funded news service for indiana. the service, called ""justin"", was to be overseen by a former reporter for the indianapolis star, and would feature breaking news, stories written by press secretaries, and light features. at the time, it was reported that the two employees who would run the news service would be paid a combined $100,000 yearly salary. the target audience was small newspapers which had limited staff, but the site would also serve to communicate directly with the public. the publisher of the commercial review of portland, indiana, said, ""i think its a ludicrous idea016, a federal judge ruled that pences order to cut off federal funds for a local non-profit refugee resettlement agency was unconstitutional; pence has appealed.in december 2015, pence said that ""calls to ban muslims from entering the u.s. are offensive and unconstitutional.""pence ""repeatedly stonewalled public records requests as governor, often withholding documents or delaying their release if not denying them outright"". as governor, pence routinely used a personal aol email account to conduct official business, according to public records. in 2016, hackers compromised the account and used it to send fraudulent emails in an attempt to obtain money from pences contacts. while pences use of a private email account for state business is not prohibited by indiana law, some of the emails discussed sensitive matters and homeland security issues. in march 2017, after pence had become vice president, the state of indiana released 29 emails to media outlets that had made public records requests, but withheld an undisclosed number of other emails, saying they were deliberative or advisory and thus exempt from public disclosure. cybersecurity experts and government transparency advocates were surprised by pences use of a personal email account to conduct public business, given pences past attacks on hillary clintons use of a private email server while u.s. secretary of state. in 2017, indiana hired a private law firm for $100,000 to handle a backlog of public-records requests for pences personal aol account email correspondence.pence ran for a second term as governor. he was unopposed in the may 3, 2016, republican primary for governor. he was to face democrat john r. gregg in a rematch of the 2012 race. however, pence filed paperwork ending his campaign on july 15, 2016, as trump announced his selection of pence as his vice presidential running mate. lieutenant governor eric holcomb was nominated in pences place, and selected suzanne crouch as his running mate. holcomb went on to defeat gregg in the general election.pence endorsed senator ted cruz of texas in the 2016 republican presidential primaries.donald trump considered naming pence as his vice presidential running mate along with other finalists including new jersey governor chris christie and former house speaker newt gingrich. pence had stronger connections at the time to the politically influential big donors, the kochs, than trump did. it was widely reported on july 14 that pence planned to end his re-election campaign and accept the republican vice presidential nomination instead. the following day, trump officially announced on twitter that pence would be his running mate.immediately after the announcement, pence said he was ""very supportive of donald trumps call to temporarily suspend immigration from countries where terrorist influence and impact represents a threat to the united states"". pence said he was ""absolutely"" in sync with trumps mexican wall proposal, saying mexico was ""absolutely"" going to pay for it.according to a fivethirtyeight rating of candidates ideology, pence was the most conservative vice-presidential candidate in the last 40 years.pence said his role model as vice president would be dick cheney.during pences preparations for the vice presidential debate in october 2016, wisconsin governor scott walker played the role of democratic vice presidential nominee tim kaine. in kaines own debate prep, lawyer robert barnett was selected to play pence. following the debate, experts concluded pence won against kaine, with a cnn poll showing 48% of viewers thought pence won and 42% believing kaine won. pences ""cooler"" temperament was seen as an advantage compared to kaine, who was perceived as more hotheaded.on october 7, 2016, lewd comments made by donald trump in 2005 surfaced and gained heavy media attention. that day, pence said to reporters, ""i do not condone his remarks and cannot defend them,"" but made clear that he was standing by trump. in response to the revelation, paul ryan, the then-speaker of the u. s. house of representatives, ""uninvited"" trump from what would have been a joint campaign event. the trump campaign attempted to substitute pence for trump at the event, but according to the new york times, pence called trump on october018 book fear: trump in the white house, in the midst of the scandal, then-republican national committee chairman reince priebus told trump he should drop out of the race for the good of the party, and that pence had agreed to replace trump on the top of the ticket as the republican presidential nominee, with former secretary of state condoleezza rice agreeing to be pences running mate.on october 10, 2016, pence appeared on cnn and said, in response to rumors that he was leaving the ticket, that it was ""absolutely false to suggest that at any point in time we considered dropping off this ticket"" and that it is the ""greatest honor of my life"" to be nominated as trumps running mate.on october 27, 2016, a chartered boeing 737 carrying pence skidded off a runway at laguardia airport in new york city and was slowed by an engineered materials arrestor system; no injuries were reported.on november 8, 2016, pence was elected vice president of the united states as trumps running mate.soon after the election, he was appointed chairman of president-elect trumps transition team. during the transition phase of the trump administration, pence was reported as holding a large degree of influence in the administration due to his roles as a mediator between trump and congressional republicans, for reassuring conservatives about trumps conservative credentials, and his influence in determining donald trumps cabinet.pence is the sixth vice president from indiana, following schuyler colfax on the first day in office  he also administered the oath of office to the white house senior staff on january 22, 2017.pence also sat in on calls made by president trump to foreign heads of government and state such as russian president vladimir putin and australian prime minister malcolm turnbull.in january, pence appointed josh pitcock as his chief of staff, who he had known from his gubernatorial and congressional days. the following month, jarrod agen was tapped as deputy assistant to the president and director of communications to the vice president; his previous job being chief of staff for governor of michigan rick snyder through the time of the flint water crisis. in july, pitcock stepped down as chief of staff, and was succeeded in the position by nick ayers, another longtime pence advisor.on february 5, 2017, pence warned iran ""not to test the resolve"" of the new trump administration following their ballistic missile tests.on february 7, 2017, pence, in his dual constitutional role as president of the united states senate made the first ever tie-breaking vote to confirm a cabinet member. he cast the deciding vote to break a fifty-fifty tie to confirm betsy devos as the secretary of education. pence cast his second tie-breaking vote on march 30, voting to advance a bill to defund planned parenthood. in 2018, pence broke a tie to confirm jonathan a. kobes for the u.s. court of appeals for the eighth circuit. this was the first ever tie-breaking vote to confirm a judicial nominee in u.s. history. as of 2019, pence has cast 13 tie-breaking votes, seventh-most in history and more than his previous four predecessors  in japan, pence met prime minister shinz1, 2017, pence delivered the commencement address at the university of notre dame. traditionally, the president delivers the address at notre dame in his inaugural year, but in 2017 pence was invited instead when trump decided to speak at liberty university.on october 8, 2017, pence walked out of a game between the nfls indianapolis colts and san francisco 49ers at trumps request after members of the 49ers knelt during the national anthem. shortly afterwards, pence commented via twitter, ""president trump and i will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our flag, or our national anthem,"" further adding, ""while everyone is entitled to their own opinion, i dont think its too much to ask nfl players to respect the flag and our national anthem."" pence was widely criticized by various people for what was considered a publicity stunt. democratic representative adam schiff  and cnn later estimated that the total cost of his eight hours of travel on air force two to attend the game was about $242,500, not including ground transportation and security. 49ers safety eric reid  reid also expressed doubt over the regularity pence is in terms of attending colts matches, and referenced a photograph of the vice president and his wife in colts uniform that had been tweeted before the match, although the official photograph  sportswriter peter king wrote that the furor surrounding pence had overshadowed peyton manning, who was being honored by the colts, saying, ""pence trumped a day that belonged to the greatest football hero the state of indiana has ever seen, and he did it for political purposes018, it was announced that pence would lead the presidential delegation to the 2018 winter olympics, alongside his wife. much of pences time at pyeongchang was affected by the ongoing north korean crisis. prior to the opening ceremony, on february 9, pence skipped on a dinner held by south korean president moon jae-in, as he would have shared a table with north koreas ceremonial head of state kim yong-nam. instead, he met with four north korean defectors in pyeongtaek, alongside his special guest, fred warmbier  at the ceremony, the pences were seated in front of the north korean delegates, and when north and south korean athletes entered during the parade of athletes, they chose to stay seated, which prompted critics to accuse pence of hypocrisy in regards to the nfl protests. pence was supposed to meet with the north koreans on february 10, but they pulled out at the last day.over the next few months, the north koreans started communicating more with their neighbors, as supreme leader kim jong-un secretly met with chinese paramount leader xi jinping in march and then moon jae-in in an historic inter-korean summit in april, and around the same time, a meeting between trump and kim was also proposed. on may 10, pence accompanied trump to andrews air force base as three american citizens were released by north korea, and in an early morning

doonbeg, 180 miles in may 2017, pence filed fec paperwork to form great america committee, a political action committee  pence is the only vice president to have started his own pac while still in office. pence denied a new york times articles allegations that he would run for president in 2020, calling them ""laughable and absurd"", and said the article was ""disgraceful and offensive"".pence was a key player in the trump-ukraine scandal and the trump impeachment inquiry. pence had at least two phone conversations and an in-person meeting with volodymyr zelensky, president of ukraine. pence met with zelensky in poland on september 1, 2019, during an unexpected delay in u.s. military aid to ukraine. pence later told the press that he did not mention 2020 presidential candidate and former vice president joe biden to zelensky, but raised issues regarding ukrainian corruption.after the inquiry was opened, pence publicly stated his support of trumps call for foreign investigation into joe biden and his son hunter, saying, ""i think the american people have a right to know if the vice president of the united states or his family profited from his position."" on october 3, pence stated, ""my predecessor had a son who was paid $50,000 a month to be on a ukrainian board at the time that vice president biden was leading the obama administrations efforts in ukraine, i think  is worth looking into.""pence defended trumps decision in january 2020 to assassinate the iranian major general in the islamic revolutionary guard corps  pences spokeswoman katie waldman said that the dozen terrorists pence referred to were those who had traveled through afghanistan, ten of whom ""were assisted by soleimani"".on february 26, 2020, president trump named pence as the leader of the white house coronavirus task force to combat the spread of the coronavirus. various public health officials and members of congress had suggested the selection of a ""coronavirus czar"", though trump has said pence will not hold such a title because he is a member of the administration. as the leader of the task force, pence will coordinate efforts with the centers for disease control and prevention, department of health and human services, national institutes of health, department of homeland security, and white house office.after it was announced a staff member of his tested positive for the coronavirus on march 20, 2020, pence confirmed he and his wife would be undergoing tests in a statement to the press, though he stressed he had no direct contact with the staff member in question. by the next day the results of the tests came back negative, with pence also announcing that more than 195,000 americans had been tested at that point, with only 19,343 returning positive. another white house employee, a u.s. military member who served as trumps valet, tested positive for the coronavirus in early may. after becoming aware of this, pence and trump were almost immediately tested once again, both proving negative.in april 2020, pence exempted himself from the mayo clinics policy of wearing a face mask in the hospital during a visit. pence defended his action, saying he needed to look staff ""in the eye"". the next day, the vice presidents opponents criticized him for promoting ""completely irresponsible public health messaging"". later, pence acknowledged he should have worn a mask during the hospital visit, and did so two days later when visiting a ventilator production facility.in late june 2020, as coronavirus cases were spiking, pence gave an optimistic press briefing where he made several misleading and false claims about the state of the coronavirus pandemic. he misleadingly argued that surges in cases were the result of increased testing, telling reporters that increases in new cases were a ""a reflection of a great success in expanding testing across the country"". however, health experts noted that case growth outpaced the number of tests, and that the share of positive tests was increasing. pence also falsely claimed that coronavirus fatalities were declining all across the country, that the curve had been flattened, and that all 50 states were opening up. in private meetings with republican senators, pence urged them to focus on ""encouraging signs"". pence told the senators that cases were increasing in only 3% of counties and 12 states; however, data at the time showed that cases were increasing in at least 5% of counties and in at least 20 states. on december 18, the pences received the pfizer/biontech covid-19 vaccine for sars-cov-2, in front of a live audience at a televised event to show americans that the vaccine is safe and effective.ahead of his presidential campaign on february 28, 2019, joe biden referred to pence as a ""decent guy"" in a speech in omaha, nebraska, when making an anecdote about an audience falling silent after pence mentioned trumps name. biden later faced criticism for his complimentary remarks due to pences alleged anti-lgbt positions, which biden would later apologize for and clarify by saying, ""i was making a point in a foreign policy context, that under normal circumstances a vice president wouldnt be given a silent reaction on the world stage."" biden had previously referred to pence as a ""decent guy"" in 2018, and pence and biden would exchange conversations via phone during pences initial transition into the vice presidency.in june 2019, the democratic former new york city council president andrew stein opined that trump could improve his re-election chances by replacing pence as his running mate with former south carolina governor and former united states ambassador to the united nations nikki haley. despite that, trump has said pence will be his running mate, but declined to endorse pence in 2019 should his running mate seek to succeed him, but said he would give it ""very strong consideration"".in remarks about law enforcement during the 2020 republican convention, pence said a federal security officer, dave underwood, ""was shot and killed during the riots in oakland"", suggesting he was killed by someone involved in nearby george floyd protests. a man linked to the far-right boogaloo movement had been charged with underwoods murder.on october 7, 2020, pence participated in a debate with kamala harris that was held by usa today in salt lake city, utah, and moderated by susan page, the washington bureau chief of the newspaper. the debate was held with adaptations designed to avoid contagion of the covid-19 virus given that the vice president had been in close contact with people who had been infected at a recent event at the white house. plexiglas partitions separated the candidates and masks were required for all attending except the candidates and moderator. by some estimates, pence interrupted harris twice as much as she interrupted him. media outlets noted that near the end of the debate, a fly landed on pences head for almost two minutes. a cnn poll found that 59% of registered voters felt that harris had won the debate, while 38% felt that pence had.on november 7, 2020, after several days of counting, biden and harris were declared by most major news networks to be the winners of the election. trump has yet to concede the election, and the trump campaign has mounted legal challenges in several states, alleging electoral fraud brought on by the large number of mail-in ballots. pence did not speak to kamala harris, the incoming vice president. for the 20201 united states senate election in georgia, pence encouraged voting by mail.in 2016, pence was described as being staunchly conservative on fiscal and social issues, with his political views strongly shaped by his christian faith and by the conservative political theorist russell kirk. as vice president, pence defended debt- and deficit-spending as a measure to stimulate economic growth. during his acceptance speech for the nomination of republican vice presidential candidate at the 2016 republican national convention he said: ""im a christian, a conservative, and a republican, in that order."" as one commentator put it, ""pence doesnt simply wear his faith on his sleeve007 and in three congressional sessions, he introduced legislation to block organizations that provide abortion services from receiving any title x funding, even for services not related to reproductive health or family planning. marjorie dannenfelser, president of the susan b. anthony list, has praised pence as a ""pro-life trailblazer"".pence has criticized comprehensive sex education. in 2002, he criticized a speech by then-secretary of state colin powell, who had said it was ""important for young people7, 2017, pence spoke at the march for life in washington, d.c., becoming the first vice president, and at the time, the highest-ranking united states official to ever speak at the annual event, until president trump spoke at the event in 2020.pence has said he supports an overturn of roe v. wade, though denied that supreme court justice brett kavanaugh was nominated for that purpose. during the 2020 vice presidential debate, when asked by moderator susan page what he would want states to do if roe were overturned, pence refused to endorse criminalizing abortion, instead simply referring to himself as ""pro-life"".pence has been a vocal opponent of efforts to expand lgbt civil rights, during both his governorship and his tenure as a u.s. representative. in 2000, his congressional campaign website said, ""congress should oppose any effort to recognize homosexuals as a discrete and insular minority entitled to the protection of anti-discrimination laws similar to those extended to women and ethnic minorities."" also included on his website was a call for ""an audit to ensure that federal dollars were no longer being given to organizations that celebrate and encourage the types of behaviors that facilitate the spreading of the hiv virus"" and instead advocated that ""resources should be directed toward those institutions which provide assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior."" some lgbt rights advocates have cited this as evidence of pence endorsing conversion therapy, a charge he denies.in 2007, pence voted against the employment non-discrimination act, which would have banned workplace discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. pence opposed the 2009 matthew shepard hate crimes act, saying that barack obama wanted to ""advance a radical social agenda"" and said that pastors ""could be charged or be subject to intimidation for simply expressing a biblical worldview on the issue of homosexual behavior"".pence has said that homosexuals should not serve in the military, saying, ""homosexuality is incompatible with military service because the presence of homosexuals in the ranks weakens unit cohesion."" pence opposed the repeal of ""dont ask, dont tell"", saying in 2010 that allowing gays and lesbians to openly serve in the military would ""have an impact on unit cohesion"".pence opposes both same-sex marriage and civil unions. while in the house, he said that ""societal collapse was always brought about following an advent of the deterioration of marriage and family."" he has advocated a constitutional same-sex marriage ban but did not champion such a proposed ban for his first year as governor.in march 2019, former vice president joe biden referred to pence as ""a decent guy"" during a speech at the university of nebraska omaha in omaha, nebraska, a month before biden announced his 2020 presidential campaign. lgbt groups, progressive leaders and celebrities strongly criticized him, with actress and new york gubernatorial candidate cynthia nixon chastising biden on twitter, to which biden responded by apologizing and criticizing pences stance on lgbt rights. nixon later penned an op-ed in the washington post calling pence ""insidious and dangerous"" for his actions on lgbt rights, claiming about bidens comments that ""its easy to say nice things about pence when youre not personally threatened by his agenda. if biden were being directly attacked in the same way that our community is, i think he would see pence from a very different vantage point.""pence was a co-sponsor of h.j.res.73, a 2011 spending limit amendment to the u.s. constitution. this amendment would limit federal spending to ""the average annual revenue collected in the three prior years, adjusted in proportion to changes in population and inflation"". in regards to adopting the gold standard, pence said in 2011, ""the time has come to have a debate over gold and the proper role it should play in our nations monetary affairs."" pence proposed legislation to end the dual mandate of the federal reserve  he has been a proponent of a flat federal tax rate. pence opposed the troubled asset relief program  pence also opposed the auto industry rescue package of 2008007, pence voted against raising the federal minimum wage to $7.25  while in the house, pence voted against the employee free choice act  he voted against the american recovery and reinvestment act of 2009. he had publicly opposed the bill denouncing it as a failure, and called for a federal spending freeze. nevertheless, several months after voting against the bill, pence privately sought $6010, hosted a job fair for stimulus-backed employers. a pence spokesperson said that ""once it became law, he had a responsibility to support local efforts to secure funding for projects that could benefit people in his district."" pence voted against the dodd006, and in favor of a series of amendments proposed that same month by jeff flake which would strip other members earmarks from the federal budget. on occasion, however, pence secured earmarks for projects in his district.pence voted against the act that created medicare part012, after the u.s. supreme court upheld the affordable care act in nfib v. sebelius, pence likened the ruling to the september 11 attacks in a closed-door meeting of the house republican conference. he immediately apologized for making the statement.pence wrote an article that appeared on his 2000 congressional campaign website arguing against the tobacco settlement and tobacco regulation, saying they would create ""new government bureaucracies"" and encroach on private lives. he wrote, ""despite the hysteria from the political class and the media, smoking doesnt kill."" pence asserted, ""two out of every three smokers does  not die from a smoking related illness and nine out of ten smokers do not contract lung cancer,"" while acknowledging that ""smoking isnt good for you"" and people who smoke should quit. in fact, smoking-related deaths comprise two out of three among those who smoke, twice as high as pence claimed. in 2009, pence voted against the family smoking prevention and tobacco control act, which allows the food and drug administration to regulate tobacco products. according to the centers for disease control and prevention, pences state of indiana has one of the worst smoking problems in america.pence was slow to support a needle exchange program in indiana to combat a major hiv outbreak related to needle-sharing among opioid drug users. while giving credit for the programs ultimate start, an aids research foundation director of public policy later deemed the outbreak ""entirely preventable"". jerome adams, pences state health commissioner, defended pences pace at responding to the situation. republican state house representative edward clere, concerned about the rapid spread of hiv in scott county, indiana, urged then-governor pence to sign an executive order to allow needle exchange programs to operate. after resisting the intervention for over two months, pence spoke to the county sheriff, prayed for guidance, then finally capitulated in may 2015, signing an executive order that allowed such a program to address the epidemic. the rate of infection spread then slowed dramatically.in february 2020, after conflicting statements by administration officials via television, it was announced that pence would control all messaging from government health officials regarding the covid-19 pandemic.in june 2006, pence unveiled an immigration plan  the plan received support from conservatives such as dick armey, but attracted criticism from other conservatives such as richard viguerie and paleoconservatives phyllis schlafly and pat buchanan, who, as described by the new york times, collectively viewed pence as lending ""his conservative prestige to a form of liberal amnesty"".pence opposes birthright citizenship. pence asserted in 2018 that the citizenship clause of the fourteenth amendment to the united states constitution  as a congressman, pence co-sponsored a bill that would have limited citizenship to children born to at least one parent who is a citizen, immigrants living permanently in the u.s. or non-citizens performing active service in the armed forces.in 2010, pence voted against the dream act, which would grant the undocumented children of illegal immigrants conditional non-immigrant status if they met certain requirements. in 2010, pence said arizona s.b. 1070, which at the time of passage in 2010 was the nations broadest and strictest anti-illegal immigration legislation, was ""a good faith to try and restore order to their communities"".pence supported president george w. bushs unsuccessful 2005 proposal to partially privatize social security by allowing workers to invest part of their social security payroll taxes in private investment accounts and reduce the increase in benefits for high-income participants. pence had previously proposed a similar but more aggressive reform plan than bushs.when asked in 2010 if he would be willing to make cuts to social security, pence answered, ""i think everything has to be on the table."" when asked if he would raise the retirement age, he said, ""im an all-of-the-above guy. we need look at everything on the menu.""pence supported the patriot act on its passage in 2001, and in 2005 called the act ""essential to our continued success in the war on terror here at home"". pence was a sponsor of legislation in 2009 to extend three expiring provisions of the patriot act pence ""has been a longtime, aggressive advocate of trade deals"" between the u.s. and foreign countries. pence has been a supporter of the north american free trade agreement  and during his tenure in the house, he voted for every free-trade agreement that came before him. pence voted in favor of the central american free trade agreement  pence also supported bilateral free-trade agreements with colombia, south korea, panama, peru, oman, chile, and singapore. pences strong stance in favor of free trade sharply differs from the stance of his running mate trump, who has condemned globalization and the liberalization of trade.pence voted against the trade and globalization act of 2007, which would have expanded trade adjustment assistance to american workers adversely affected by globalization. however, in 2014 pence called for the ""swift adoption"" of the trans-pacific partnership pence supported the iraq war resolution, which authorized military action against iraq. during the iraq war, pence opposed setting a public withdrawal date from iraq. during an april 2007 visit to baghdad, pence and john mccain visited shorja market, the site of a deadly attack in february 2007 which had claimed 61 lives. pence and mccain described the visit as evidence that the security situation in iraqi markets had improved. the visit to the market took place under tight security, including helicopters overhead, and the new york times reported that the visit gave a false indication of how secure the area was because of the extremely heavy security forces protecting mccain. pence chaired the house foreign affairs subcommittee on the middle east and was a prominent supporter of george w. bushs iraq war troop surge of 2007. at the time, pence said ""the surge is working"" and defended the initial decision to invade in 2003.pence has opposed closing the guantanamo bay detention camp and trying the suspected

as ""americas most cherished ally"". he visited israel in 2014 to express his support, and in 2016 signed into law a bill which would ban indiana from having any commercial dealings with a company that boycotts israel. he opposes a palestinian state.pence criticized russian president vladimir putin and barack obamas alleged weak leadership, saying: ""when donald trump and i observe that, as ive said in syria, in iran, in ukraine, that the small and bullying leader of russia has been stronger on the world stage than this administration, thats stating painful facts. thats not an endorsement of vladimir putin. thats an indictment of the weak and feckless leadership.""two weeks prior to the nato intervention in libya, pence thanked the obama administration and secretary of state hillary clinton for their efforts to isolate the gaddafi regime. pence expressed support for ""a no-fly zone"" and said ""gaddafi must go.""pence condemned the ""terrible savagery"" against rohingya muslims in myanmar, saying ""the images of the violence and its victims have shocked the american people, and decent people all over the world.""pence called on turkish president recep tayyip erdo018, the u.s. department of treasury imposed sanctions on two senior turkish government ministers who were involved in the detention of brunson. erdo6, 2018, pence raised the xinjiang re-education camps issue at ministerial to advance religious freedom. he said that ""sadly, as we speak as well, beijing is holding hundreds of thousands, and possibly millions, of uyghur muslims in so-called re-education camps, where theyre forced to endure around-the-clock political indoctrination and to denounce their religious beliefs and their cultural identity as the goal.""pence ""does not accept the scientific consensus that human activity is the primary driver of climate change"". in 2001, pence wrote in an op-ed that ""global warming is a myth,"" saying that ""the earth is actually cooler today than it was about 50 years ago."" in 2006 and 2009, pence expressed the view that it was unclear whether global warming was driven by human activity, and in 2009 he told political commentator chris matthews that there was a ""growing skepticism in the scientific community about global warming"". in 2009, pence led the republican effort to defeat the american clean energy and security act  on september 27, 2016, however, pence said ""theres no question"" that human activity affects both the climate and the environment. pence holds a lifetime rating of four percent from the league of conservation voters. while in the house, pence ""voted to eliminate funding for climate education programs and to prohibit the environmental protection agency from regulating greenhouse gas emissions"". pence also ""repeatedly voted against energy efficiency and renewable energy funding and rules"" and voted ""for several bills that supported fossil fuel development, including legislation promoting offshore drilling"".pence has questioned proposals to decrease penalties for low-level marijuana offenses in indiana, saying the state should focus on ""reducing crime, not reducing penalties"". in 2013, pence expressed concern that a then-pending bill to revise the states criminal code was not tough enough on drug crimes, and successfully lobbied to limit the reduction in sentencing of marijuana offenses.in 2016, he signed into law a measure that would reinstate a ten-year mandatory minimum prison sentence for certain drug offenders.during 2014, pence sent a letter to united states attorney general eric holder, saying indiana would not comply with federal prison rape elimination standards because they were ""too expensive"". according to the indiana department of corrections, it would

united v. federal election commission when it was announced. pence said:freedom won today in the supreme court. todays ruling in the citizens united case takes us one step closer to the founding fathers vision of free speech, a vision that is cherished by all americans and one congress has a responsibility to protect. if the freedom of speech means anything, it means protecting the right of private citizens to voice opposition or support for their elected representatives. the fact that the court overturned a 20-year precedent speaks volumes about the importance of this issue.pence described the bipartisan campaign reform act, known as mccain020020, commenting how ""e also dont need to choose between supporting our police and supporting african american families here in philadelphia or anywhere in america. we can do both. we have done both.""in the late 1990s, pence supported the impeachment of president bill clinton. arguing for the moral requirements of the office of the presidency, pence wrote that an american president with ""bad moral habits"" can ""incinerate the planet"", thus nothing less than a president who represents ""all of our highest hopes and ideals and values"" could be accepted. pence also brought up ""staggering rates of illegitimacy and divorce"", mandating that ""america needs to be able to look to her first family as role models.""mike and karen pence have been married since 1985. the two met while he was in law school at indiana university. they have three children: michael, charlotte, and audrey. during pences

"raw foodism, also known as rawism or following a raw food diet, is the dietary practice of eating only or mostly food that is uncooked and unprocessed. depending on the philosophy, or type of lifestyle and results desired, raw food diets may include a selection of fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, eggs, fish, meat, and dairy products. the diet may also include simply processed foods, such as various types of sprouted seeds, cheese, and fermented foods such as yogurts, kefir, kombucha, or sauerkraut, but generally not foods that have been pasteurized, homogenized, or produced with the use of synthetic pesticides, fertilizers, solvents, and food additives.the british dietetic association has described raw foodism as a fad diet. raw food diets, specifically raw veganism, may diminish intake of essential minerals and nutrients, such as vitamin b12. claims held by raw food proponents are pseudoscientific.:44raw food diets are diets composed entirely or mostly of food that is uncooked or that is cooked at low temperatures.included in raw animal food diets are any food that can be eaten raw, such as uncooked, unprocessed raw muscle-meats/organ-meats/eggs, raw dairy, and aged, raw animal foods such as century eggs, fermented meat/fish/shellfish/kefir, as well as vegetables, fruits, nuts, and sprouts, but in general not raw grains, raw beans, and raw soy. raw foods included on such diets have not been heated above 401st century. a raw vegan diet consists of unprocessed, raw plant foods that have not been heated above 40018"", raising a concern that it could compromise long-term health.early documentation of raw food dieting has been associated with hermits and monks practicing asceticism. for example, john of egypt a hermit from the nitrian desert lived on a diet of dried fruit and vegetables for fifty years, he never ate anything cooked. documented evidence of a commitment to raw food was by the ethiopian monk qozmos, who in the late 1300s ce committed to the ascetic discipline of eating only uncooked food. this posed a problem for his ethiopian orthodox tewahedo church monastery because he refused to eat the bread of the eucharist, which is cooked. as a result, he fled the church and went to live with the jewish community of the beta israel.contemporary raw food diets were first developed in switzerland by maximilian bircher-benner :41, vitamin d, and calories for a growing child on a totally raw vegan diet.food poisoning is a health risk for all people eating raw foods, and increased demand for raw foods is associated with greater incidence of foodborne illness, especially for raw meat, fish, and shellfish. outbreaks of gastroenteritis among consumers of raw and undercooked animal products  are well-documented, and include raw meat, raw organ meat, raw fish  shellfish, raw milk and products made from raw milk, and raw eggs.one review stated that ""many raw foods are toxic and only become safe after they have been cooked. some raw foods contain substances that destroy vitamins, interfere with digestive enzymes or damage the walls of the intestine. raw meat can be contaminated with bacteria which would be destroyed by cooking; raw fish can contain substances that interfere with vitamin b1 \xa0food portal",1,0
"2nd-century0th century, french historian fernand braudel revolutionized the study of history, by using such outside disciplines as economics, anthropology, and geography in the study of global history.traditionally, historians have recorded events of the past, either in writing or by passing on an oral tradition, and have attempted to answer historical questions through the study of written documents and oral accounts. from the beginning, historians have also used such sources as monuments, inscriptions, and pictures. in general, the sources of historical knowledge can be separated into three categories: what is written, what is said, and what is physically preserved, and historians often consult all three. but writing is the marker that separates history from what comes before.archaeology is especially helpful in unearthing buried sites and objects, which contribute to the study of history. archaeological finds rarely stand alone, with narrative sources complementing its discoveries. archaeologys methodologies and approaches are independent from the field of history. ""historical archaeology"" is a specific branch of archaeology which often contrasts its conclusions against those of contemporary textual sources. for example, mark leone, the excavator and interpreter of historical annapolis, maryland, usa, has sought to understand the contradiction between textual documents idealizing ""liberty"" and the material record, demonstrating the possession of slaves and the inequalities of wealth made apparent by the study of the total historical environment.there are varieties of ways in which history can be organized, including chronologically, culturally, territorially, and thematically. these divisions are not mutually exclusive, and significant intersections are often present. it is possible for historians to concern themselves with both the very specific and the very general, although the modern trend has been toward specialization. the area called big history resists this specialization, and searches for universal patterns or trends. history has often been studied with some practical or theoretical aim, but also may be studied out of simple intellectual curiosity.the history of the world is the memory of the past experience of homo sapiens sapiens around the world, as that experience has been preserved, largely in written records. by ""prehistory"", historians mean the recovery of knowledge of the past in an area where no written records exist, or where the writing of a culture is not understood. by studying painting, drawings, carvings, and other artifacts, some information can be recovered even in the absence of a written record. since the 20th century, the study of prehistory is considered essential to avoid historys implicit exclusion of certain civilizations, such as those of sub-saharan africa and pre-columbian america. historians in the west have been criticized for focusing disproportionately on the western world. in 1961, british historian e. h. carr wrote:the line of demarcation between prehistoric and historical times is crossed when people cease to live only in the present, and become consciously interested both in their past and in their future. history begins with the handing down of tradition; and tradition means the carrying of the habits and lessons of the past into the future. records of the past begin to be kept for the benefit of future generations.this definition includes within the scope of history the strong interests of peoples, such as indigenous australians and new zealand m0th century, academic historians focused less on epic nationalistic narratives, which often tended to glorify the nation or great men, to more objective and complex analyses of social and intellectual forces. a major trend of historical methodology in the 20th century was a tendency to treat history more as a social science rather than as an art, which traditionally had been the case. some of the leading advocates of history as a social science were a diverse collection of scholars which included fernand braudel, e. h. carr, fritz fischer, emmanuel le roy ladurie, hans-ulrich wehler, bruce trigger, marc bloch, karl dietrich bracher, peter gay, robert fogel, lucien febvre and lawrence stone. many of the advocates of history as a social science were or are noted for their multi-disciplinary approach. braudel combined history with geography, bracher history with political science, fogel history with economics, gay history with psychology, trigger history with archaeology while wehler, bloch, fischer, stone, febvre and le roy ladurie have in varying and differing ways amalgamated history with sociology, geography, anthropology, and economics. nevertheless, these multidisciplinary approaches failed to produce a theory of history. so far only one theory of history came from the pen of a professional historian. whatever other theories of history we have, they were written by experts from other fields  digital information companies, such as google, have sparked controversy over the role of internet censorship in information access.the marxist theory of historical materialism theorises that society is fundamentally determined by the material conditions at any given time007, of the 5723 faculty members, 1644 the ""old"" social history before the 1960s was a hodgepodge of topics without a central theme, and it often included political movements, like populism, that were ""social"" in the sense of being outside the elite system. social history was contrasted with political history, intellectual history and the history of great men. english historian g. m. trevelyan saw it as the bridging point between economic and political history, reflecting that, ""without social history, economic history is barren and political history unintelligible."" while the field has often been viewed negatively as history with the politics left out, it has also been defended as ""history with the people put back in.""the chief subfields of social history include:cultural history replaced social history as the dominant form in the 1980s and 1990s. it typically combines the approaches of anthropology and history to look at language, popular cultural traditions and cultural interpretations of historical experience. it examines the records and narrative descriptions of past knowledge, customs, and arts of a group of people. how peoples constructed their memory of the past is a major topic.cultural history includes the study of art in society as well is the study of images and human visual production diplomatic history  focuses on the relationships between nations, primarily regarding diplomacy and the causes of wars. more recently it looks at the causes of peace and human rights. it typically presents the viewpoints of the foreign office, and long-term strategic values, as the driving force of continuity and change in history. this type of political history is the study of the conduct of international relations between states or across state boundaries over time. historian muriel chamberlain notes that after the first world war, ""diplomatic history replaced constitutional history as the flagship of historical investigation, at once the most important, most exact and most sophisticated of historical studies."" she adds that after 1945, the trend reversed, allowing social history to replace it.although economic history has been well established since the late 19th century, in recent years academic studies have shifted more and more toward economics departments and away from traditional history departments. business history  deals with the history of individual business organizations, business methods, government regulation, labour relations, and impact on society. it also includes biographies of individual companies, executives, and entrepreneurs. it is related to economic history; business history is most often taught in business schools.environmental history is a new field that emerged in the 1980s to look at the history of the environment, especially in the long run, and the impact of human activities upon it. it is an offshoot of the environmental movement, which was kickstarted by rachel carsons silent spring in the 1960s.world history is the study of major civilizations over the last 3000 years or so. world history is primarily a teaching field, rather than a research field. it gained popularity in the united states, japan and other countries after the 1980s with the realization that students need a broader exposure to the world as globalization proceeds.it has led to highly controversial interpretations by oswald spengler and arnold j. toynbee, among others.the world history association publishes the journal of world history every quarter since 1990. the h-world discussion list serves as a network of communication among practitioners of world history, with discussions among scholars, announcements, syllabi, bibliographies and book reviews.a peoples history is a type of historical work which attempts to account for historical events from the perspective of common people. a peoples history is the history of the world that is the story of mass movements and of the outsiders. individuals or groups not included in the past in other type of writing about history are the primary focus, which includes the disenfranchised, the oppressed, the poor, the nonconformists, and the otherwise forgotten people. the authors are typically on the left and have a socialist model in mind, as in the approach of the history workshop movement in britain in the 1960s.intellectual history and the history of ideas emerged in the mid-20th century, with the focus on the intellectuals and their books on the one hand, and on the other the study of ideas as disembodied objects with a career of their own.gender history is a subfield of history and gender studies, which looks at the past from the perspective of gender. the outgrowth of gender history from womens history stemmed from many non-feminist historians dismissing the importance of women in history. according to joan w. scott, 1st century was for the latter schools to increasingly demand scholarly productivity of their younger tenure-track faculty. furthermore, universities have increasingly relied on inexpensive part-time adjuncts to do most of the classroom teaching.from the origins of national school systems in the 19th century, the teaching of history to promote national sentiment has been a high priority. in the united states after world war i, a strong movement emerged at the university level to teach courses in western civilization, so as to give students a common heritage with europe. in the u.s. after 1980, attention increasingly moved toward teaching world history or requiring students to take courses in non-western cultures, to prepare students for life in a globalized economy.at the university level, historians debate the question of whether history belongs more to social science or to the humanities. many view the field from both perspectives.the teaching of history in french schools was influenced by the nouvelle histoire as disseminated after the 1960s by cahiers p1st-century germany, the history curriculum is controlled by the 16 states, and is characterized not by superpatriotism but rather by an ""almost pacifistic and deliberately unpatriotic undertone"" and reflects ""principles formulated by international organizations such as unesco or the council of europe, thus oriented towards human rights, democracy and peace.""  the result is that ""german textbooks usually downplay national pride and ambitions and aim to develop an understanding of citizenship centered on democracy, progress, human rights, peace, tolerance and europeanness.""",1,0
"a military, also known collectively as armed forces, is a heavily armed, highly organized force primarily intended for warfare. it is typically officially authorized and maintained by a sovereign state, with its members identifiable by their distinct military uniform. it may consist of one or more military branches such as an army, navy, air force, space force, marines, or coast guard. the main task of the military is usually defined as defence of the state and its interests against external armed threats.in broad usage, the terms ""armed forces"" and ""military"" are often treated as synonymous, although in technical usage a distinction is sometimes made in which a countrys armed forces may include both its military and other paramilitary forces. there are various forms of irregular military forces, not belonging to a recognized state; though they share many attributes with regular military forces, they are less often referred to as simply ""military"".a nations military may function as a discrete social subculture, with dedicated infrastructure such as military housing, schools, utilities, logistics, hospitals, legal services, food production, finance, and banking services. beyond warfare, the military may be employed in additional sanctioned and non-sanctioned functions within the state, including internal security threats, population control, the promotion of a political agenda, emergency services and reconstruction, protecting corporate economic interests, social ceremonies and national honour guards.the profession of soldiering as part of a military is older than recorded history itself. some of the most enduring images of  classical antiquity portray the power and feats of its military leaders. the battle of kadesh in 1274 bc was one of the defining points of pharaoh ramses iis reign, and his monuments commemorate it in bas-relief. a thousand years later, the first emperor of unified china, qin shi huang, was so determined to impress the gods with his military might that he had himself buried with an army of  terracotta soldiers.the  romans paid considerable attention to military matters, leaving to posterity many treatises and writings on the subject, as well as many lavishly carved triumphal arches and victory columns.the first recorded use of the word military in english, spelled militarie, was in 1582. it comes from the latin militaris as a noun, the military usually refers generally to a countrys armed forces, or sometimes, more specifically, to the senior officers who command them. in general, it refers to the physicality of armed forces, their personnel, equipment, and the physical area which they occupy.as an adjective, military originally referred only to soldiers and soldiering, but it soon broadened to apply to land forces in general, and anything to do with their profession. the names of both the royal military academy military history is often considered to be the history of all conflicts, not just the history of the state militaries. it differs somewhat from the history of war, with military history focusing on the people and institutions of war-making, while the history of war focuses on the evolution of war itself in the face of changing technology, governments, and geography.military history has a number of facets. one main facet is to learn from past accomplishments and mistakes, so as to more effectively wage war in the future. another is to create a sense of military tradition, which is used to create cohesive military forces. still, another may be to learn to prevent wars more effectively. human knowledge about the military is largely based on both recorded and oral history of military conflicts despite the growing importance of military technology, military activity depends above all on people. for example, in 2000 the british army declared: ""man is still the first weapon of war.""the military organization is characterized by a strict command hierarchy divided by military rank, with ranks normally grouped  10% in the uk, 13% in sweden, 16% in the us, and 27% in south africa. while two-thirds of states now recruit or conscript only adults, as of 2017 50 states still relied partly on children under the age of 18 whereas recruits who join as officers tend to be upwardly-mobile, most enlisted personnel have a childhood background of relative socio-economic deprivation.020 on the socio-economic backgrounds of u.s. armed forces personnel suggests that they are at parity or slightly higher than the civilian population with respect to socio-economic indicators such as parental income, parental wealth and cognitive abilities. the study found that technological, tactical, operational and doctrinal changes have led to a change in the demand for personnel. furthermore, the study suggests that the most disadvantaged socio-economic groups are less likely to meet the requirements of the modern u.s. military.the obligations of military employment are many. full-time military employment normally requires a minimum period of service of several years; between two and six years is typical of armed forces in australia, the uk and the us, for example, depending on role, branch, and rank. some armed forces allow a short discharge window, normally during training, when recruits may leave the armed force as of right. alternatively, part-time military employment, known as reserve service, allows a recruit to maintain a civilian job while training under military discipline at weekends; he or she may be called out to deploy on operations to supplement the full-time personnel complement. after leaving the armed forces, recruits may remain liable for compulsory return to full-time military employment in order to train or deploy on operations.military law introduces offences not recognised by civilian courts, such as absence without leave  penalties range from a summary reprimand to imprisonment for several years following a court martial. certain fundamental rights are also restricted or suspended, including the freedom of association  military personnel in some countries have a right of conscientious objection if they believe an order is immoral or unlawful, or cannot in good conscience carry it out.personnel may be posted to bases in their home country or overseas, according to operational need, and may be deployed from those bases on exercises or operations anywhere in the world. during peacetime, when military personnel are generally stationed in garrisons or other permanent military facilities, they mostly conduct administrative tasks, training and education activities, technology maintenance, and recruitment.initial training conditions recruits for the demands of military life, including preparedness to injure and kill other people, and to face mortal danger without fleeing. it is a physically and psychologically intensive process which resocializes recruits for the unique nature of military demands. for example:the next requirement comes as a fairly basic need for the military to identify possible threats it may be called upon to face. for this purpose, some of the commanding forces and other military, as well as often civilian personnel participate in identification of these threats. this is at once an organization, a system and a process collectively called military intelligence although some groups engaged in combat, such as militants or resistance movements, refer to themselves using military terminology, notably army or front, none have had the structure of a national military to justify the reference, and usually have had to rely on support of outside national militaries. they also use these terms to conceal from the mi their true capabilities, and to impress potential ideological recruits.having military intelligence representatives participate in the execution of the national defence policy is important, because it becomes the first respondent and commentator on the policy expected strategic goal, compared to the realities of identified threats. when the intelligence reporting is compared to the policy, it becomes possible for the national leadership to consider allocating resources over and above the officers and their subordinates military pay, and the expense of maintaining military facilities and military support services for them.defense economics is the financial and monetary efforts made to resource and sustain militaries, and to finance military operations, including war.the process of allocating resources is conducted by determining a military budget, which is administered by a military finance organization within the military. military procurement is then authorized to purchase or contract provision of goods and services to the military, whether in peacetime at a permanent base, or in a combat zone from local population.capability development, which is often referred to as the military strength, is arguably one of the most complex activities known to humanity; because it requires determining: strategic, operational, and tactical capability requirements to counter the identified threats; strategic, operational, and tactical doctrines by which the acquired capabilities will be used; identifying concepts, methods, and systems involved in executing the doctrines; creating design specifications for the manufacturers who would produce these in adequate quantity and quality for their use in combat; purchase the concepts, methods, and systems; create a forces structure that would use the concepts, methods, and systems most effectively and efficiently; integrate these concepts, methods, and systems into the force structure by providing military education, training, and practice that preferably resembles combat environment of intended use; create military logistics systems to allow continued and uninterrupted performance of military organizations under combat conditions, including provision of health services to the personnel, and maintenance for the equipment; the services to assist recovery of wounded personnel, and repair of damaged equipment; and finally, post-conflict demobilization, and disposal of war stocks surplus to peacetime requirements.development of military doctrine is perhaps the more important of all capability development activities, because it determines how military forces were, and are used in conflicts, the concepts and methods used by the command to employ appropriately military skilled, armed and equipped personnel in achievement of the tangible goals and objectives of the war, campaign, battle, engagement, action or a duel. the line between strategy and tactics is not easily blurred, although deciding which is being discussed had sometimes been a matter of personal judgement by some commentators, and military historians. the use of forces at the level of organization between strategic and tactical is called operational mobility.there have been attempts to produce a military strength index: this is an example taken from a credit suisse report in september 2015. the factors under consideration for that military strength indicator and their total weights were: number of active personnel in the armed forces these were the results:because most of the concepts and methods used by the military, and many of its systems are not found in commercial branches, much of the material is researched, designed, developed, and offered for inclusion in arsenals by military science organizations within the overall structure of the military. military scientists are therefore found to interact with all arms and services of the armed forces, and at all levels of the military hierarchy of command.although concerned with research into military psychology, particularly combat stress and how it affect troop morale, often the bulk of military science activities is directed at military intelligence technology, military communications, and improving military capability through research. the design, development, and prototyping of weapons, military support equipment, and military technology in general, is also an area in which much effort is invested 0th centuries. this was mainly employed in world war i in the gallipoli campaign, and the western front. trench warfare often turned to a stalemate, only broken by a large loss of life, because, in order to attack an enemy entrenchment, soldiers had to run through an exposed no mans land under heavy fire from their opposing entrenched enemy.as with any occupation, since the ancient times, the military has been distinguished from other members of the society by their tools, the military weapons, and military equipment used in combat. when stone age humans first took a sliver of flint to tip the spear, it was the first example of applying technology to improve the weapon.since then, the advances made by human societies, and that of weapons, has been irretrievably linked. stone weapons gave way to bronze age weapons, and later, the iron age weapons. with each technological change, was realized some tangible increase in military capability, such as through greater effectiveness of a sharper edge in defeating leather armour, or improved density of materials used in manufacture of weapons.on land, the first really significant technological advance in warfare was the development of the ranged weapons, and notably, the sling. the next significant advance came with the domestication of the horses and mastering of equestrianism.arguably, the greatest invention that affected not just the military, but all society, after adoption of fire, was the wheel, and its use in the construction of the chariot. there were no advances in military technology, until, from the mechanical arm action of a slinger, the greeks, egyptians, romans, persians, chinese, etc., developed the siege engines. the bow was manufactured in increasingly larger and more powerful versions, to increase both the weapon range, and armour penetration performance. these developed into the powerful composite and recurve bows, and crossbows of ancient china. these proved particularly useful during the rise of cavalry, as horsemen encased in ever-more sophisticated armour came to dominate the battlefield.somewhat earlier, in medieval china, gunpowder had been invented, and was increasingly used by the military in combat. the use of gunpowder in the early vase-like mortars in europe, and advanced versions of the long bow and cross bow, which all had armour-piercing arrowheads, that put an end to the dominance of the armoured knight. after the long bow, which required great skill and strength to use, the next most significant technological advance was the musket, which could be used effectively, with little training. in time, the successors to muskets and cannon, in the form of rifles and artillery, would become core battlefield technology.as the speed of technological advances accelerated in civilian applications, so too warfare became more industrialized. the newly invented machine gun and repeating rifle redefined firepower on the battlefield, and, in part, explains the high casualty rates of the american civil war. the next breakthrough was the conversion of artillery parks from the muzzle loading guns, to the quicker loading breech loading guns with recoiling barrel that allowed quicker aimed fire and use of a shield. the widespread introduction of low smoke  blame on the military-industrial complex.the most significant technological developments that influenced combat have been the guided missiles, which can be used by all branches of the armed services. more recently, information technology, and its use in surveillance, including space-based reconnaissance systems, have played an increasing role in military operations.the impact of information warfare that focuses on attacking command communication systems, and military databases, has been coupled with the new development in military technology, has been the use of robotic systems in intelligence combat, both in hardware and software applications.recently, there has also been a particular focus towards the use of renewable fuels for running military vehicles on. unlike fossil fuels, renewable fuels can be produced in any country, creating a strategic advantage. the us military has committed itself to have 50% of its energy consumption come from alternative sources.for much of military history, the armed forces were considered to be for use by the heads of their societies, until recently, the crowned heads of states. in a democracy or other political system run in the public interest, it is a public force.the relationship between the military and the society it serves is a complicated and ever-evolving one. much depends on the nature of the society itself, and whether it sees the military as important, as for example in time of threat or war, or a burdensome expense typified by defence cuts in time of peace.one difficult matter in the relation between military and society is control and transparency. in some countries, limited information on military operations and budgeting is accessible for the public. however transparency in the military sector is crucial to fight corruption. this showed the government defence anti-corruption index transparency international uk published in 2013.militaries often function as societies within societies, by having their own military communities, economies, education, medicine, and other aspects of a functioning civilian society. although a military is not limited to nations in of itself as many private military companies (or pmcs can be used or hired by organizations and figures as security, escort, or other means of protection; where police, agencies, or militaries are absent or not trusted.militarist ideology is the societys social attitude of being best served, or being a beneficiary of a government, or guided by concepts embodied in the military culture, doctrine, system, or leaders.either because of the cultural memory, national history, or the potentiality of a military threat, the militarist argument asserts that a civilian population is dependent upon, and thereby subservient to the needs and goals of its military for continued independence. militarism is sometimes contrasted with the concepts of comprehensive national power, soft power and hard power.most nations have separate military laws which regulate conduct in war and during peacetime. an early exponent was hugo grotius, whose on the law of war and peace (1625 had a major impact of the humanitarian approach to warfare development. his theme was echoed by gustavus adolphus.ethics of warfare have developed since 1945, to create constraints on the military treatment of prisoners and civilians, primarily by the geneva conventions; but rarely apply to use of the military forces as internal security troops during times of political conflict that results in popular protests and incitement to popular uprising.international protocols restrict the use, or have even created international bans on some types of weapons, notably weapons of mass destruction (wmd. international conventions define what constitutes a war crime, and provides for war crimes prosecution. individual countries also have elaborate codes of military justice, an example being the united states uniform code of military justice that can lead to court martial for military personnel found guilty of war crimes.military actions are sometimes argued to be justified by furthering a humanitarian cause, such as disaster relief operations, or in defence of refugees. the term military humanism is used to refer to such actions.",1,0

"reportedly haunted locations:fortune telling is the practice of predicting information about a persons life. the scope of fortune telling is in principle identical with the practice of divination. the difference is that divination is the term used for predictions considered part of a religious ritual, invoking deities or spirits, while the term fortune telling implies a less serious or formal setting, even one of popular culture, where belief in occult workings behind the prediction is less prominent than the concept of suggestion, spiritual or practical advisory or affirmation.historically, fortune telling grows out of folkloristic reception of renaissance magic, specifically associated with romani people. during the 19th and 20th century, methods of divination from non-western cultures, such as the i ching, were also adopted as methods of fortune telling in western popular culture.an example of divination or fortune telling as purely an item of pop culture, with little or no vestiges of belief in the occult, would be the magic 8-ball sold as a toy by mattel, or paul ii, an octopus at the sea life aquarium at oberhausen used to predict the outcome of matches played by the germany national football team.there is opposition to fortune telling in christianity, islam, and judaism based on scriptural prohibitions against divination.terms for one who claims to see into the future include fortune teller, crystal-gazer, spaewife, seer, soothsayer, sibyl, clairvoyant, and prophet; related terms which might include this among other abilities are oracle, augur, and visionary.fortune telling is dismissed by the scientific community and scientific skeptics as being based on magical thinking and superstition.common methods used for fortune telling in europe and the americas include astromancy, horary astrology, pendulum reading, spirit board reading, tasseography  some women have maintained long relationships with their personal readers. telephone consultations with psychics popular media outlets like the new york times have explained to their american readers that although 5000 years ago, soothsayers were prized advisers to the assyrians, they lost respect and reverence during the rise of reason in the 17th and 18th centuries.with the rise of commercialism, ""the sale of occult practices  in the larger society,"" according to sociologists danny l. and lin jorgensen. ken feingold, writer of ""interactive art as divination as a vending machine,"" stated that with the invention of money, fortune telling became ""a private service, a commodity within the marketplace"".as j. peder zane wrote in the new york times in 1994, referring to the psychic friends network, ""whether it,000 and $9,000 per month to have her available 24 hours a day to consult.in 1982, danny jorgensen, a professor of religious studies at the university of south florida offered a spiritual explanation for the popularity of fortune telling. he said that people visit psychics or fortune tellers to gain self-understanding, and knowledge which will lead to personal power or success in some aspect of life.in 1995, ken feingold offered a different explanation for why people seek out fortune tellers: ""we desire to know other people, danny l., and lin jorgensen found that ""while there is considerable variation among  occupations,  are over-represented in human service fields: counseling, social work, teaching, health care."" the same authors, making a limited survey of north american diviners, found that the majority of fortune tellers are married with children, and a few claim graduate degrees. ""they attend movies, watch television, work at regular jobs, shop at k-mart, sometimes eat at mcdonalds, and go to the hospital when they are seriously ill.""in 1982, the sociologists danny l., and lin jorgensen found that, ""when it is reasonable,  comply with local laws and purchase a business license."" however, in the united states, a variety of local and state laws restrict fortune telling, require the licensing or bonding of fortune tellers, or make necessary the use of terminology that avoids the term ""fortune teller"" in favor of terms such as ""spiritual advisor"" or ""psychic consultant."" there are also laws that outright forbid the practice in certain districts.for instance, fortune telling is a class b misdemeanor in the state of new york. under new york state law, s 165.35:a person is guilty of fortune telling when, for a fee or compensation which he directly or indirectly solicits or receives, he claims or pretends to tell fortunes, or holds himself out as being able, by claimed or pretended use of occult powers, to answer questions or give advice on personal matters or to exercise, influence or affect evil spirits or curses; except that this section does not apply to a person who engages in the aforedescribed conduct as part of a show or exhibition solely for the purpose of entertainment or amusement.lawmakers who wrote this statute acknowledged that fortune tellers do not restrict themselves to ""a show or exhibition solely for the purpose of entertainment or amusement"" and that people will continue to seek out fortune tellers even though fortune tellers operate in violation of the law.similarly, in new zealand, section 16 of the summary offences act 1981 provides a one thousand dollar penalty for anyone who sets out to ""deceive or pretend"" for financial recompense that they possess telepathy or clairvoyance or acts as a medium for money through use of ""fraudulent devices."" as with the new york legislation cited above, however, it is not a criminal offence if it is solely intended for purposes of entertainment.saudi arabia also bans the practice outright, considering fortune telling to be sorcery and thus contrary to islamic teaching and jurisprudence. it has been punishable by death.fortune telling is dismissed by the scientific community and skeptics as being based on magical thinking and superstition.skeptic bergen evans suggested that fortune telling is the result of a ""na\xc3\xafve selection of something that have  happened from a mass of things that havent, the clever interpretation of ambiguities, or a brazen announcement of the inevitable."" other skeptics claim that fortune telling is nothing more than cold reading.a large amount of fraud has occurred in the practice of fortune telling.there are some fortune-telling websites that provide people with online fortune-telling. people sign up at these webpages, chose the type of fortune-telling they wish, and ask the advisors to foresee their future. the readers available at there websites generally offer services such as the reading of tea leaves, coffee-grounds, tarot cards, playing cards, bones, geomantic charts, crystal balls, and horoscopes for a fee.",1,0
"music therapy is an evidence-based clinical use of musical interventions to improve clients quality of life. music therapists use music and its many facets013 cochrane review, listening to music may improve heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure in those with coronary heart disease music is useful in the recovery of motor skills. in a study on stroke patients in the recovery phase, music therapy was used in addition to other types of therapy in one group of patients and was not used in the other group. while both groups showed an increase in their standard of living, the group that used the music therapy showed more of an increase than the group that didnt. the group that used music therapy also showed less anxiousness and depression after the therapy. while both groups showed an increase in the strength of their non-dominant hands, the group with music therapy showed a much larger increase. also, patients that underwent music therapy were able to regulate their emotions better and showed increased communication as a whole.music therapy has been proven to be of beneficial use to older adults all over the world. dr. hanne mette ridder, a musical therapy expert from denmark, studied the importance of the roles of musical therapists and caregivers on the mental well-being of patients suffering from dementia. the use of musical interaction has been proven as a key factor in many countries for the improvement of older adults overall health. according to karen stuart, south africa has poor quality services provided by hospital care facilities to elders dealing with dementia, therefore she discovered singing to be an effective method for improving patients well-being. the playing of classical music or therapeutic singing resulted in: enjoyment, awareness, and engagement. providing a source of music in hospitals or care centers are valuable methods for contributing to the care of the patients, while also relieving stress placed on the caregiver and forming a bond between the patient and the caretaker. also passive listening to personalized playlists is being promoted in dementia care.like many of the other disorders mentioned, some of the most common significant effects of the disorder can be seen in social behaviors, leading to improvements in interaction, conversation, and other such skills. a meta-study of over 330 subjects showed that music therapy produces highly significant improvements in social behaviors, overt behaviors like wandering and restlessness, reductions in agitated behaviors, and improvements to cognitive defects, measured with reality orientation and face recognition tests. the effectiveness of the treatment seems to be strongly dependent on the patient and the quality and length of treatment.a group of adults suffering with dementia participated in group music therapy. in the group, these adults engaged in singing, drumming, improvisation, and movement. each of these activities engaged the adults in different ways. the singing aided with memory, as these adults improved memorization skills in by taking out specific words in the chorus of a song and by repeating phrases back to the music therapist when the therapist sang a phrase of a song to them. drumming led to increased socialization of the group, as it allowed the patients collaborate in order to create particular rhythms. improvisation allowed the patients to get out of their comfort zone and taught them how to better deal with anxiety. lastly, movement with either one arm or two increased social interaction between the patients.another meta-study examined the proposed neurological mechanisms behind music therapys effects on these patients. many authors suspect that music has a soothing effect on the patient by affecting how noise is perceived: music renders noise familiar, or buffers the patient from overwhelming or extraneous noise in their environment. others suggest that music serves as a sort of mediator for social interactions, providing a vessel through which to interact with others without requiring much cognitive load.brocas aphasia, or non-fluent aphasia, is a language disorder caused by

aboriginal people of australia. the modern name of their healing tool is the didgeridoo, but it was originally called the yidaki. the yidaki produced sounds that are similar to the sound healing techniques used in modern day. for at least 40,000 years, the healing tool was believed to assist in healing ""broken bones, muscle tears and illnesses of every kind"".however, here are no reliable sources stating the didgeridoos exact age. archaeological studies of rock art in northern australia suggest that the people of the kakadu region of the northern territory have been using the didgeridoo for less than 1,000 years, based on the dating of paintings on cave walls and shelters from this period. a clear rock painting in ginga wardelirrhmeng, on the northern edge of the arnhem

zuckerberg attended harvard university, where he launched the facebook social networking service from his dormitory room on february 4, 2004, with college roommates eduardo saverin, andrew mccollum, dustin moskovitz, and chris hughes. originally launched to select college campuses, the site expanded rapidly and eventually beyond colleges, reaching one billion users by 2012. zuckerberg took the company public in may 2012 with majority shares. in 2007, at age 23, he became the worlds youngest self-made billionaire. as of november 2020, zuckerbergs net worth is $101.2 billion, making him the

in the world as a part of its person of the year award. in december 2016, zuckerberg was ranked 10th on forbes list of the worlds most powerful people.zuckerberg was born on may 14, 1984, in white plains, new york. his parents are karen  he and his three sisters, randi, donna, and arielle, were brought up in dobbs ferry, new york, a small westchester county village about 21 miles  zuckerberg

tutor him privately. zuckerberg took a graduate course in the subject at mercy college near his home while still in high school. in one program, since his fathers dental practice was operated from their home, he built a software program he called ""zucknet"" that allowed all the computers between the house and dental office to communicate with each other. it is considered a ""primitive"" version of aols instant messenger, which came out the following year.a new yorker profile said of zuckerberg: ""some kids played computer games. mark created them."" zuckerberg himself recalls this period: ""i had a bunch of friends who were artists. theyd come over, draw stuff, and id build a game out of it."" the new yorker piece noted that zuckerberg was not, however, a typical ""geek-klutz"", as he later became captain of his prep school fencing team and earned a classics diploma. napster co-founder sean parker, a close friend, notes that zuckerberg was ""really into greek odysseys and all that stuff"", recalling how he once quoted lines from the roman epic poem aeneid, by virgil, during a facebook product conference.during zuckerbergs high-school years, he worked under the company name intelligent media group to build a music player called the synapse media player. the device used machine learning to learn the users listening habits, which was posted to slashdot and

he studied psychology and computer science and belonged to alpha epsilon pi and kirkland house. in his sophomore year, he wrote a program that he called coursematch, which allowed users to make class selection decisions based on the choices of other students and also to help them form study groups. a short time later, he created a different program he initially called facemash that let students select the best-looking person from a choice of photos. according to arie hasit, zuckerbergs roommate at the time, ""he built the site for fun."" hasit explains:we had books called face books, which included the names and pictures of everyone who lived in the student dorms. at first, he built a site and placed two pictures or pictures of two males and two females. visitors to the site had to choose who was ""hotter"" and according to the votes there would be a ranking.the site went up over a weekend, but by monday morning, the college shut it down, because its popularity had overwhelmed one of harvards network switches and prevented students from accessing the internet. in addition, many students complained that their photos were being used without permission. zuckerberg apologized publicly, and the student paper ran articles stating that his site was ""completely improper.""the following semester, in january 2004, zuckerberg began writing code for a new website. on february 4, 2004, zuckerberg launched ""thefacebook,"" originally located at thefacebook.com.six days after the site launched, three harvard seniors, cameron winklevoss, tyler winklevoss, and divya narendra, accused zuckerberg of intentionally misleading them into believing he would help them build a social network called harvardconnection.com, while he was instead using their ideas to build a competing product. the three complained to the harvard crimson, and the newspaper began an investigation in response.following the official launch of the facebook social media platform, the three filed a lawsuit against zuckerberg that resulted in a settlement. the agreed settlement was for 1.2 million facebook shares.zuckerberg dropped out of harvard in his sophomore year in order to complete his

commencement speech, received an honorary degree from harvard.on february 4, 2004, zuckerberg launched facebook from his harvard dormitory room. an earlier inspiration for facebook may have come from phillips exeter academy, the prep school from which zuckerberg graduated in 2002. it published its own student directory, ""the photo address book"", which students referred to as ""the facebook"". such photo directories were an important part of the student social experience at many private schools. with them, students were able to list attributes such as their class years, their friends, and their telephone numbers.once at college, zuckerbergs facebook started off as just a ""harvard thing"" until zuckerberg decided to spread it to other schools, enlisting the help of roommate dustin moskovitz. they began with columbia university, new york university, stanford, dartmouth, cornell, university of pennsylvania, brown, and yale. samyr laine, a triple jumper representing haiti at the

distributed social networking service. he called it a ""cool idea"".zuckerberg founded the start-up: education foundation. on september 22, 2010, it was reported that zuckerberg had donated $100 million to newark public schools, the public school system of newark, new jersey. critics noted the timing of the donation as being close to the release of the social network, which painted a somewhat negative portrait of zuckerberg. zuckerberg responded to the criticism, saying, ""the thing that i was most sensitive about with the movie timing was, i didnt want the press about the social network movie to get conflated with the newark project. i was thinking about doing this anonymously just so that the two things could be kept separate."" newark mayor cory booker stated that he and new jersey governor chris christie had to convince zuckerbergs team not to make the donation anonymously. the money was largely wasted, according to journalist dale russakoff.on december 9, 2010, zuckerberg, bill gates, and investor warren buffett signed ""the giving pledge"", in which they promised to donate to charity at least half of their wealth over the course of time, and invited others among the wealthy to donate 50 percent or more of their wealth to charity.in december 2012, zuckerberg and his wife priscilla chan announced that over the course of their lives they would give the majority of their wealth to ""advancing human potential and promoting equality"" in the spirit of the giving pledge.on december 19, 2013, zuckerberg announced a donation of 18 million facebook shares to the silicon valley community foundation, to be executed by the end of the month013, the donation was recognized as the largest charitable gift on public record for 2013. the chronicle of philanthropy placed zuckerberg and his wife at the top of the magazines annual list of 50 most generous americans for 2013, having donated roughly $1 billion to charity.in october 2014, zuckerberg and his wife priscilla chan donated us$25 million to combat the ebola virus disease, specifically the west african ebola virus epidemic.on december 1, 2015, zuckerberg and chan pledged to transfer 99% of their facebook shares, then valued at us$45 billion, to the chan zuckerberg initiative, their new organization that will focus on health and education. the funds will not be transferred immediately, but over the course of their lives. instead of forming a charitable corporation to donate the value of the stock to, as bill gates, warren buffett, larry page, sergey brin and other billionaires have done, zuckerberg and chan chose to use the structure of a limited liability company in 2016, the chan zuckerberg initiative gave $600 million to create the tax-exempt charity chan zuckerberg biohub, a collaborative research space in san franciscos mission bay district near the university of california, san francisco, with the intent to foster interaction and collaboration between scientists at ucsf, university of california, berkeley, and stanford university. intellectual property generated would be jointly owned by biohub and the discoverers home institution. unlike foundations like the bill and melinda gates foundation which open up all research funded to unrestricted access and reuse by the public, biohub retains the right to commercialize any research it funds. inventors will have the option of making their discoveries open-source, with permission from biohub.amidst the covid-19 pandemic, zuckerberg donated $25 million to a bill and melinda gates foundation-backed accelerator that is searching for treatments for the disease. he also announced $25 million in grants to support local journalism that was impacted by the pandemic and $75 million in advertisement purchases in local newspapers by facebook, inc., where facebook will market itself.in 2002, zuckerberg registered to vote in westchester county, new york, where he grew up, but did not cast a ballot until november 2008. santa clara county registrar of voters spokeswoman, elma rosas, told bloomberg that zuckerberg is listed as ""no preference"" on voter rolls, and he voted in at least two of the past three general elections, in 2008 and 2012.zuckerberg has never revealed his own political affiliation or voting history: some news outlets consider him to be a conservative, while others consider him liberal.on february 13, 2013, zuckerberg hosted his first ever fundraising event for new jersey governor chris christie. zuckerbergs particular interest on this occasion was education reform, and christies education reform work focused on teachers unions and the expansion of charter schools. later that year, zuckerberg hosted a campaign fundraiser for newark mayor cory booker, who was running in the 2013 new jersey special senate election. in september 2010, with the support of governor chris christie, booker obtained a us$100 million pledge from zuckerberg to newark public schools. in december 2012, zuckerberg donated 18 million shares to the silicon valley community foundation, a community organization that includes education in its list of grant-making areas.on april 11, 2013, zuckerberg led the launch of a 501 the goals of the group include immigration reform, improving the state of education in the united states, and enabling more technological breakthroughs that benefit the public, yet it has also been criticized for financing ads advocating a variety of oil and gas development initiatives, including drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge and the keystone xl pipeline. in 2013, numerous liberal and progressive groups, such as the league of conservation voters, moveon.org, the sierra club, democracy for america, credo, daily kos, 350.org, and presente and progressives united agreed to either pull their facebook ad buys or not buy facebook ads for at least two weeks, in protest of zuckerberg ads funded by fwd.us that were in support of oil drilling and the keystone xl pipeline, and in opposition to obamacare among republican united states senators who back immigration reform.a media report on june 20, 2013 revealed that zuckerberg actively engaged with facebook users on his own profile page after the online publication of a fwd.us video. in response to a claim that the fwd.us organization is ""just about tech wanting to hire more people"", the internet entrepreneur replied: ""the bigger problem were trying to address is ensuring the 11 million undocumented folks living in this country now and similar folks in the future are treated fairly.""in june 2013, zuckerberg joined facebook employees in a company float as part of the annual san francisco lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender pride celebration. the company first participated in the event in 2011, with 70 employees, and this number increased to 700 for the 2013 march. the 2013 pride celebration was especially significant, as it followed a u.s. supreme court ruling that deemed the defense of marriage act when questioned about the mid-2013 prism scandal at the techcrunch disrupt conference in september 2013, zuckerberg stated that the u.s. government ""blew it."" he further explained that the government performed poorly in regard to the protection of the freedoms of its citizens, the economy, and companies.zuckerberg placed a statement on his facebook wall on december 9, 2015 which said that he wants ""to add my voice in support of muslims in our community and around the world"" in response to the aftermath of the november 2015 paris attacks and the 2015 san bernardino attack. the statement also said that muslims are ""always welcome"" on facebook, and that his position was a result of the fact that ""as a jew, my parents taught me that we must stand up against attacks on all communities.""on february 24, 2016, zuckerberg sent out a company-wide internal memo to employees formally rebuking employees who had crossed out handwritten ""black lives matter"" phrases on the company walls and had written ""all lives matter"" in their place. facebook allows employees to free-write thoughts and phrases on company walls. the memo was then leaked by several employees. as zuckerberg had previously condemned this practice at previous company meetings, and other similar requests had been issued by other leaders at facebook, zuckerberg wrote in the memo that he would now consider this overwriting practice not only disrespectful, but ""malicious as well."" according to zuckerbergs memo, ""black lives matter doesnt mean other lives dont 017, zuckerberg criticized donald trumps executive order to severely limit immigrants and refugees from some countries.zuckerberg has funded a state-level ballot initiative for the 2020 general election that would raise taxes by altering californias proposition 13 to require the tax assessment of commercial and industrial properties in the state at market rate.raised jewish, zuckerberg once identified as an atheist but has since revised his views. in 2016, he said: ""i was raised jewish and then i went through a period where i questioned things, but now i believe religion is very important.""he met his then-future wife, fellow harvard student priscilla chan, at a fraternity party during his sophomore year there. they began dating in 2003.in september 2010, zuckerberg invited chan, by then a medical student at the university of california, san francisco, to move into his rented palo alto house. he studied mandarin in preparation for the couples visit to china in december 2010. on may 19, 2012, they married in his backyard in an event that also celebrated her graduation from medical school. on july 31, 2015, zuckerberg announced that they were expecting a baby girl and revealed that chan had experienced three miscarriages previously. on december 1, zuckerberg announced the birth of their daughter, maxima chan zuckerberg  the couple announced in their

"psychiatry is the medical specialty devoted to the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of mental disorders. these include various maladaptations related to mood, behaviour, cognition, and perceptions. see glossary of psychiatry.initial psychiatric assessment of a person typically begins with a case history and mental status examination. physical examinations and psychological tests may be conducted. on occasion, neuroimaging or other neurophysiological techniques are used. mental disorders are often diagnosed in accordance with clinical concepts listed in diagnostic manuals such as the international classification of diseases the combined treatment of psychiatric medication and psychotherapy has become the most common mode of psychiatric treatment in current practice, but contemporary practice also includes a wide variety of other modalities, e.g., assertive community treatment, community reinforcement, and supported employment. treatment may be delivered on an inpatient or outpatient basis, depending on the severity of functional impairment or on other aspects of the disorder in question. an inpatient may be treated in a psychiatric hospital. research and treatment within psychiatry as a whole are conducted on an interdisciplinary basis with other professionals, such as epidemiologists, nurses, or psychologists.the term psychiatry was first coined by the german physician johann christian reil in 1808 and literally means the medical treatment of the soul  it has been described as an intermediary between the world from a social context and the world from the perspective of those who are mentally ill.people who specialize in psychiatry often differ from most other mental health professionals and physicians in that they must be familiar with both the social and biological sciences. the discipline studies the operations of different organs and body systems as classified by the patients subjective experiences and the objective physiology of the patient.  psychiatry treats mental disorders, which are conventionally divided into three very general categories: mental illnesses, severe learning disabilities, and personality disorders. while the focus of psychiatry has changed little over time, the diagnostic and treatment processes have evolved dramatically and continue to do so. since the late 20th century, the field of psychiatry has continued to become more biological and less conceptually isolated from other medical fields.though the medical specialty of psychiatry uses research in the field of neuroscience, psychology, medicine, biology, biochemistry, and pharmacology, it has generally been considered a middle ground between neurology and psychology. because psychiatry and neurology are deeply intertwined medical specialties, all certification for both specialties and for their subspecialties is offered by a single board, the american board of psychiatry and neurology, one of the member boards of the american board of medical specialties. unlike other physicians and neurologists, psychiatrists specialize in the doctor012.psychiatric treatments have changed over the past several decades. in the past, psychiatric patients were often hospitalized for six months or more, with some cases involving hospitalization for many years.average inpatient psychiatric treatment stay has decreased significantly since the 1960s, a trend known as deinstitutionalization. today in most countries, people receiving psychiatric treatment are more likely to be seen as outpatients. if hospitalization is required, the average hospital stay is around one to two weeks, with only a small number receiving long-term hospitalization.. however, in japan psychiatric hospitals continue to keep patients for long periods, sometimes even keeping them in physical restraints, strapped to their beds for periods of weeks or months.psychiatric inpatients are people admitted to a hospital or clinic to receive psychiatric care. some are admitted involuntarily, perhaps committed to a secure hospital, or in some jurisdictions to a facility within the prison system. in many countries including the united states and canada, the criteria for involuntary admission vary with local jurisdiction. they may be as broad as having a mental health condition, or as narrow as being an immediate danger to themselves or others. bed availability is often the real determinant of admission decisions to hard pressed public facilities. european human rights legislation restricts detention to medically certified cases of mental disorder, and adds a right to timely judicial review of detention.people may be admitted voluntarily if the treating doctor considers that safety isnt compromised by this less restrictive option. inpatient psychiatric wards may be secure in many developed countries there has been a massive reduction in psychiatric beds since the mid 20th century, with the growth of community care. standards of inpatient care remain a challenge in some public and private facilities, due to levels of funding, and facilities in developing countries are typically grossly inadequate for the same reason. even in developed countries, programs in public hospitals vary widely. some may offer structured activities and therapies offered from many perspectives while others may only have the funding for medicating and monitoring patients. this may be problematic in that the maximum amount of therapeutic work might not actually take place in the hospital setting. this is why hospitals are increasingly used in limited situations and moments of crisis where patients are a direct threat to themselves or others. alternatives to psychiatric hospitals that may actively offer more therapeutic approaches include rehabilitation centers or ""rehab"" as popularly termed.outpatient treatment involves periodic visits to a psychiatrist for consultation in his or her office, or at a community-based outpatient clinic. initial appointments, at which the psychiatrist conducts a psychiatric assessment or evaluation of the patient, are typically 45 to 75 minutes in length. follow-up appointments are generally shorter in duration, i.e., 15 to 30 minutes, with a focus on making medication adjustments, reviewing potential medication interactions, considering the impact of other medical disorders on the patients mental and emotional functioning, and counseling patients regarding changes they might make to facilitate healing and remission of symptoms  a major reason for this change was the advent of managed care insurance plans, which began to limit reimbursement for psychotherapy sessions provided by psychiatrists. the underlying assumption was that psychopharmacology was at least as effective as psychotherapy, and it could be delivered more efficiently because less time is required for the appointment. for example, most psychiatrists schedule three or four follow-up appointments per hour, as opposed to seeing one patient per hour in the traditional psychotherapy model. because of this shift in practice patterns, psychiatrists often refer patients whom they think would benefit from psychotherapy to other mental health professionals, e.g., clinical social workers and psychologists.the earliest known texts on mental disorders are from ancient india and include the ayurvedic text, charaka samhita. the first hospitals for curing mental illness were established in india during the 3rd century bce.the greeks also created early manuscripts about mental disorders. in the 4th century bce, hippocrates theorized that physiological abnormalities may be the root of mental disorders. in 4th to 5th century b.c. greece, hippocrates wrote that he visited democritus and found him in his garden cutting open animals. democritus explained that he was attempting to discover the cause of madness and melancholy. hippocrates praised his work. democritus had with him a book on madness and melancholy. during the 5th century bce, mental disorders, especially those with psychotic traits, were considered supernatural in origin, a view which existed throughout ancient greece and rome, as well as egyptian regions. religious leaders often turned to versions of exorcism to treat mental disorders often utilizing methods that many consider to be cruel or barbaric methods. trepanning was one of these methods used throughout history.the islamic golden age fostered early studies in islamic psychology and psychiatry, with many scholars writing about mental disorders. the persian physician muhammad ibn zakariya al-razi, also known as ""rhazes"", wrote texts about psychiatric conditions in the 9th century. as chief physician of a hospital in baghdad, he was also the director of one of the first psychiatric wards in the world. two of his works in particular, el-mansuri and al-hawi, provide descriptions and treatments for mental illnesses.abu zayd al-balkhi, was a persian polymath during the 9th and 10th centuries and one of the first to classify neurotic disorders. he pioneered cognitive therapy in order to treat each of these classified neurotic disorders. he classified neurosis into four emotional disorders: fear and anxiety, anger and aggression, sadness and depression, and obsession. al-balkhi further classified three types of depression: normal depression or sadness the first bimaristan was founded in baghdad in the 9th century, and several others of increasing complexity were created throughout the arab world in the following centuries. some of the bimaristans contained wards dedicated to the care of mentally ill patients, most of whom suffered from debilitating illnesses or exhibited violence. specialist hospitals such as bethlem royal hospital in london were built in medieval europe from the 13th century to treat mental disorders, but were used only as custodial institutions and did not provide any type of treatment.the beginning of psychiatry as a medical specialty is dated to the middle of the nineteenth century, although its germination can be traced to the late eighteenth century. in the late 17th century, privately run asylums for the insane began to proliferate and expand in size. in 1713 the bethel hospital norwich was opened, the first purpose-built asylum in england. in 1656, louis xiv of france created a public system of hospitals for those suffering from mental disorders, but as in england, no real treatment was applied.during the enlightenment attitudes towards the mentally ill began to change. it came to be viewed as a disorder that required compassionate treatment. in 1758 english physician william battie wrote his treatise on madness on the management of mental disorder. it was a critique aimed particularly at the bethlem hospital, where a conservative regime continued to use barbaric custodial treatment. battie argued for a tailored management of patients entailing cleanliness, good food, fresh air, and distraction from friends and family. he argued that mental disorder originated from dysfunction of the material brain and body rather than the internal workings of the mind.the introduction of moral treatment was initiated independently by the french doctor philippe pinel and the english quaker william tuke. in 1792 pinel became the chief physician at the bic. the utica state hospital was opened around 1850. many state hospitals in the united states were built in the 1850s and 1860s on the kirkbride plan, an architectural style meant to have curative effect.at the turn of the century, england and france combined had only a few hundred individuals in asylums. by the late 1890s and early 1900s, this number had risen to the hundreds of thousands. however, the idea that mental illness could be ameliorated through institutionalization ran into difficulties. psychiatrists were pressured by an ever-increasing patient population, and asylums again became almost indistinguishable from custodial institutions.in the early 1800s, psychiatry made advances in the diagnosis of mental illness by broadening the category of mental disease to include mood disorders, in addition to disease level delusion or irrationality. the 20th century introduced a new psychiatry into the world, with different perspectives of looking at mental disorders. for emil kraepelin, the initial ideas behind biological psychiatry, stating that the different mental disorders are all biological in nature, evolved into a new concept of ""nerves"", and psychiatry became a rough approximation of neurology and neuropsychiatry. following sigmund freuds pioneering work, ideas stemming from psychoanalytic theory also began to take root in psychiatry. the psychoanalytic theory became popular among psychiatrists because it allowed the patients to be treated in private practices instead of warehoused in asylums.by the 1970s, however, the psychoanalytic school of thought became marginalized within the field. biological psychiatry reemerged during this time. psychopharmacology became an integral part of psychiatry starting with otto loewis discovery of the neuromodulatory properties of acetylcholine; thus identifying it as the first-known neurotransmitter. neuroimaging was first utilized as a tool for psychiatry in the 1980s. the discovery of chlorpromazines effectiveness in treating schizophrenia in 1952 revolutionized treatment of the disorder, as did lithium carbonates ability to stabilize mood highs and lows in bipolar disorder in 1948. psychotherapy was still utilized, but as a treatment for psychosocial issues.in 1963, us president john f. kennedy introduced legislation delegating the national institute of mental health to administer community mental health centers for those being discharged from state psychiatric hospitals. later, though, the community mental health centers focus shifted to providing psychotherapy for those suffering from acute but less serious mental disorders. ultimately there were no arrangements made for actively following and treating severely mentally ill patients who were being discharged from hospitals, resulting in a large population of chronically homeless people suffering from mental illness.controversy has often surrounded psychiatry, with scholars producing critiques. it has been argued that psychiatry: is too influenced by ideas from medicine, causing it to misunderstand the nature of mental distress; that its use of drugs is in part due lobbying by drug companies resulting in distortion of research; that the concept of ""mental illness"" is often used to label and control those with beliefs and behaviours that the majority of people disagree with; and that it confuses disorders of the mind with disorders of the brain that can be treated with drugs. critique of psychiatry from within the field comes from the critical psychiatry group in the uk.the term ""anti-psychiatry"" was coined by psychiatrist david cooper in 1967 and was later made popular by thomas szasz. the word ""antipsychiatrie"" was already used in germany in 1904. the basic premise of the anti-psychiatry movement is that psychiatrists attempt to classify ""normal"" people as ""deviant;"" psychiatric treatments are ultimately more damaging than helpful to patients; and psychiatrys history involves  several former patient groups have been formed often referring to themselves as ""survivors."" in 1973, the rosenhan experiment was conducted to determine the validity of psychiatric diagnosis. volunteers feigned hallucinations to enter psychiatric hospitals, and acted normally afterwards. they were diagnosed with psychiatric disorders and were given antipsychotic drugs. the study was conducted by psychologist david rosenhan, a stanford university professor, and published by the journal science under the title ""on being sane in insane places"".the church of scientology is critical of psychiatry, whereas others have questioned the veracity of information the church of scientology provides to the public.",1,0
"applied science is the use of existing scientific knowledge to practical goals, like technology or inventions.within natural science, disciplines that are basic science develop basic information to explain and perhaps predict phenomena in the natural world. applied science is the use of scientific processes and knowledge as the means to achieve a particular practical or useful result. this includes a broad range of applied science related fields, including engineering and medicine.applied science can also apply formal science, such as statistics and probability theory, as in epidemiology. genetic epidemiology is an applied science applying both biological and statistical methods.applied research is the practical application of science. it accesses and uses accumulated theories, knowledge, methods, and techniques, for a specific, state-, business-, or client-driven purpose.  applied research is contrasted with pure research  applied research usually has specific commercial objectives related to products, procedures, or services.  the comparison of pure research and applied research provides a basic framework and direction for businesses to follow.  applied research deals with solving practical problems and generally employs empirical methodologies. because applied research resides in the messy real world, strict research protocols may need to be relaxed. for example, it may be impossible to use a random sample. thus, transparency in the methodology is crucial. implications for interpretation of results brought about by relaxing an otherwise strict canon of methodology should also be considered.since applied research has a provisional close-to-the-problem and close-to-the-data orientation, it may also use a more provisional conceptual framework such as working hypotheses or pillar questions. the oecds frascati manual describes applied research as one of the three forms of research, along with basic research & experimental development.due to its practical focus, applied research information will be found in the literature associated with individual disciplines.engineering fields include thermodynamics, heat transfer, fluid mechanics, statics, dynamics, mechanics of materials, kinematics, electromagnetism, materials science, earth sciences, engineering physics.medical sciences, for instance medical microbiology and clinical virology, are applied sciences that apply biology toward medical knowledge and inventions, but not necessarily medical technology, whose development is more specifically biomedicine or biomedical engineering.in canada, the netherlands and other places the bachelor of applied science  applied science courses generally contain more coursework however, their merits are argued elsewhere.in the united states, the college of william & mary offers an undergraduate minor as well as master of science and doctor of philosophy degrees in ""applied science."" courses and research cover varied fields including neuroscience, optics, materials science and engineering, nondestructive testing, and nuclear magnetic resonance. university of nebraska\x80\x93lincoln offers a bachelor of science in applied science, an online completion bachelor of science in applied science and a master of applied science. course work is centered on science, agriculture and natural resources with a wide range of options including ecology, food genetics, entrepreneurship, economics, policy, animal science and plant science. in new york city, the bloomberg administration awarded the consortium of cornell-technion $100 million in city capital to construct the universities proposed applied sciences campus on roosevelt island.",1,0
"pollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment that cause adverse change. pollution can take the form of chemical substances or energy, such as noise, heat, or light. pollutants, the components of pollution, can be either foreign substances/energies or naturally occurring contaminants. pollution is often classed as point source or nonpoint source pollution. in 2015, pollution killed 9 million people worldwide.major forms of pollution include air pollution, light pollution, litter, noise pollution, plastic pollution, soil contamination, radioactive contamination, thermal pollution, visual pollution, and water pollution.air pollution has always accompanied civilizations. pollution started from prehistoric times, when man created the first fires. according to a 1983 article in the journal science, ""soot"" found on ceilings of prehistoric caves provides ample evidence of the high levels of pollution that was associated with inadequate ventilation of open fires."" metal forging appears to be a key turning point in the creation of significant air pollution levels outside the home. core samples of glaciers in greenland indicate increases in pollution associated with greek, roman, and chinese metal production.the burning of coal and wood, and the presence of many horses in concentrated areas made the cities the primary sources of pollution. the industrial revolution brought an infusion of untreated chemicals and wastes into local streams that served as the water supply. king edward i of england banned the burning of sea-coal by proclamation in london in 1272, after its smoke became a problem; the fuel was so common in england that this earliest of names for it was acquired because it could be carted away from some shores by the wheelbarrow.it was the industrial revolution that gave birth to environmental pollution as we know it today. london also recorded one of the earlier extreme cases of water quality problems with the great stink on the thames of 1858, which led to construction of the london sewerage system soon afterward. pollution issues escalated as population growth far exceeded viability of neighborhoods to handle their waste problem. reformers began to demand sewer systems and clean water.in 1870, the sanitary conditions in berlin were among the worst in europe. august bebel recalled conditions before a modern sewer system was built in the late 1870s:waste-water from the houses collected in the gutters running alongside the curbs and emitted a truly fearsome smell. there were no public toilets in the streets or squares. visitors, especially women, often became desperate when nature called. in the public buildings the sanitary facilities were unbelievably primitive....as a metropolis, berlin did not emerge from a state of barbarism into civilization until after 1870.""the primitive conditions were intolerable for a world national capital, and the imperial german government brought in its scientists, engineers, and urban planners to not only solve the deficiencies, but to forge berlin as the worlds model city. a british expert in 1906 concluded that berlin represented ""the most complete application of science, order and method of public life,"" adding ""it is a marvel of civic administration, the most modern and most perfectly organized city that there is.""the emergence of great factories and consumption of immense quantities of coal gave rise to unprecedented air pollution and the large volume of industrial chemical discharges added to the growing load of untreated human waste. chicago and cincinnati were the first two american cities to enact laws ensuring cleaner air in 1881. pollution became a major issue in the united states in the early twentieth century, as progressive reformers took issue with air pollution caused by coal burning, water pollution caused by bad sanitation, and street pollution caused by the 3 million horses who worked in american cities in 1900, generating large quantities of urine and manure. as historian martin melosi notes, the generation that first saw automobiles replacing the horses saw cars as ""miracles of cleanliness"". by the 1940s, however, automobile-caused smog was a major issue in los angeles.other cities followed around the country until early in the 20th century, when the short lived office of air pollution was created under the department of the interior. extreme smog events were experienced by the cities of los angeles and donora, pennsylvania in the late 1940s, serving as another public reminder.air pollution would continue to be a problem in england, especially later during the industrial revolution, and extending into the recent past with the great smog of 1952. awareness of atmospheric  pollution spread widely after world war ii, with fears triggered by reports of radioactive fallout from atomic warfare and testing. then a non-nuclear event in london005 pollution abatement capital expenditures and operating costs in the us amounted to nearly $27 billion.society derives some indirect utility from pollution, otherwise there would be no incentive to pollute. this utility comes from the consumption of goods and services that create pollution. therefore, it is important that policymakers attempt to balance these indirect benefits with the costs of pollution in order to achieve an efficient outcome.it is possible to use environmental economics to determine which level of pollution is deemed the social optimum. for economists, pollution is an 50 million metric tons. americans constitute less than 5% of the worlds population, but produce roughly 25% of the worlds co2, and generate approximately 30% of worlds waste. in 2007, china overtook the united states as the worlds biggest producer of co2, while still far behind based on per capita pollution in february 2007, a report by the intergovernmental panel on climate change some of the more common soil contaminants are chlorinated hydrocarbons pollution can also be the consequence of a natural disaster. for example, hurricanes often involve water contamination from sewage, and petrochemical spills from ruptured boats or automobiles. larger scale and environmental damage is not uncommon when coastal oil rigs or refineries are involved. some sources of pollution, such as nuclear power plants or oil tankers, can produce widespread and potentially hazardous releases when accidents occur.in the case of noise pollution the dominant source class is the motor vehicle, producing about ninety percent of all unwanted noise worldwide.adverse air quality can kill many organisms, including humans. ozone pollution can cause respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, throat inflammation, chest pain, and congestion. water pollution causes approximately 14,000 deaths per day, mostly due to contamination of drinking water by untreated sewage in developing countries. an estimated 500 million indians have no access to a proper toilet, over ten million people in india fell ill with waterborne illnesses in 2013, and 1,535 people died, most of them children. nearly 500 million chinese lack access to safe drinking water. a 2010 analysis estimated that 1.2 million people died prematurely each year in china because of air pollution. the high smog levels china has been facing for a long time can do damage to civilians bodies and cause different diseases. the who estimated in 2007 that air pollution causes half a million deaths per year in india. studies have estimated that the number of people killed annually in the united states could be over 50,000.oil spills can cause skin irritations and rashes. noise pollution induces hearing loss, high blood pressure, stress, and sleep disturbance. mercury has been linked to developmental deficits in children and neurologic symptoms. older people are majorly exposed to diseases induced by air pollution. those with heart or lung disorders are at additional risk. children and infants are also at serious risk. lead and other heavy metals have been shown to cause neurological problems. chemical and radioactive substances can cause cancer and as well as birth defects.an october 2017 study by the lancet commission on pollution and health found that global pollution, specifically toxic air, water, soils and workplaces, kills nine million people annually, which is triple the number of deaths caused by aids, tuberculosis and malaria combined, and 15 times higher than deaths caused by wars and other forms of human violence. the study concluded that ""pollution is one of the great existential challenges of the anthropocene era. pollution endangers the stability of the earth018 report by the

it is also argued as to whether hip hop started in the south or west bronx. while the term hip hop is often used to refer exclusively to hip hop music  hip hop is characterized by four key elements: ""rapping""  other elements are: hip hop culture and historical knowledge of the movement  the fifth element, although debated, is commonly considered either street knowledge, hip hop fashion, or beatboxing.the bronx hip hop scene emerged in the mid-1970s from neighborhood block parties thrown by the black spades, an african-american group that has been described as being a gang, a club, and a music group. brother-sister duo dj kool herc, and cindy campbell additionally hosted dj parties in the bronx and are credited for the rise in the genre. hip hop culture has spread to both urban and suburban communities throughout the united states and subsequently the world. these elements were adapted and developed considerably, particularly as the art forms spread to new continents and merged with local styles in the 1990s and subsequent decades. even as the movement continues to expand globally and explore myriad styles and art forms, including hip hop theater and hip hop film, the four foundational elements provide coherence and a strong foundation for hip hop culture. hip hop is simultaneously a new and old phenomenon; the importance of sampling tracks, beats, and basslines from old records to the art form means that much of the culture has revolved around the idea of updating classic recordings, attitudes, and experiences for modern audiences. sampling older culture and reusing it in a new context or a new format is called ""flipping"" in hip hop culture. hip hop music follows in the footsteps of earlier african-american-rooted and latino musical genres such as blues, jazz, rag-time, funk, salsa, and disco to become one of the most practiced genres worldwide.in 1990, ronald ""bee-stinger"" savage, a former member of the zulu nation, is credited for coining the term ""six elements of the hip hop movement,"" inspired by public enemys recordings. the ""six elements of the hip hop movement"" are: consciousness awareness, civil rights awareness, activism awareness, justice, political awareness, and community awareness in music. ronald savage is known as the son of the hip hop movement.in the 2000s, with the rise of new media platforms such as online music streaming services, fans discovered and downloaded or streamed hip hop music through social networking sites beginning with blackplanet & myspace, as well as from websites like youtube, worldstarhiphop, soundcloud, and spotify.keith ""cowboy"" wiggins, a member of grandmaster flash and the furious five, has been credited with coining the term in 1978 while teasing a friend who had just joined the us army by scat singing the made-up words ""hip/hop/hip/hop"" in a way that mimicked the rhythmic cadence of marching soldiers. cowboy later worked the ""hip hop"" cadence into his stage performance. the group frequently performed with disco artists who would refer to this new type of music by calling them ""hip hoppers."" the name was originally meant as a sign of disrespect but soon came to identify this new music and culture.the song ""rappers delight"" by the sugarhill gang, released in 1979, begins with the phrase ""i said a hip, hop, the hippie the hippie to the hip hip hop, and you dont stop"". lovebug starski  interview of afrika bambaataa by michael holman in the east village eye. the term gained further currency in september of that year in the village voice, in a profile of bambaataa written by steven hager, who also published the first comprehensive history of the culture with st. martins press.in the 1970s, an underground urban movement known as ""hip hop"" began to form in the bronx, new york city. it focused on emceeing  historically, hip hop arose out of the ruins of a post-industrial and ravaged south bronx, as a form of expression of urban black and latino youth, whom the public and political discourse had written off as marginalized communities. jamaican-born dj clive ""kool herc"" campbell pioneered the use of djing percussion ""breaks"" in hip hop music. beginning at hercs home in a high-rise apartment at 1520 sedgwick avenue, the movement later spread across the entire borough. on august 11, 1973 dj kool herc was the dj at his sisters back-to-school party. he extended the beat of a record by using two record players, isolating the percussion ""breaks"" by using a mixer to switch between the two records. kool hercs sister, cindy campbell, produced and funded the back to school party that became the ""birth of hip hop."". hercs experiments with making music with record players became what we now know as breaking or ""scratching.""a second key musical element in hip hop music is emceeing  the basic elements of hip hop-inch records where they would rap to the beat. influential tunes included fatback bands ""king tim iii  herc and other djs would connect their equipment to power lines and perform at venues such as public basketball courts and at 1520 sedgwick avenue, bronx, new york, now officially a historic building. the equipment consisted of numerous speakers, turntables, and one or more microphones. by using this technique, djs could create a variety of music, but according to rap attack by david toop ""at its worst the technique could turn the night into one endless and inevitably boring song"". kc the prince of soul, a rapper-lyricist with pete dj jones, is often credited with being the first rap lyricist to call himself an ""mc.""street gangs were prevalent in the poverty of the south bronx, and much of the graffiti, rapping, and b-boying at these parties were all artistic variations on the competition and one-upmanship of street gangs. sensing that gang members often violent urges could be turned into creative ones, afrika bambaataa founded the zulu nation, a loose confederation of street-dance crews, graffiti artists, and rap musicians. by the late 1970s, the culture had gained media attention, with billboard magazine printing an article titled ""b beats bombarding bronx"", commenting on the local phenomenon and mentioning influential figures such as kool herc. the new york city blackout of 1977 saw widespread looting, arson, and other citywide disorders especially in the bronx where a number of looters stole dj equipment from electronics stores. as a result, the hip hop genre, barely known outside of the bronx at the time, grew at an astounding rate from 1977 onward.dj kool hercs house parties gained popularity and later moved to outdoor venues in order to accommodate more people. hosted in parks, these outdoor parties became a means of expression and an outlet for teenagers, where ""instead of getting into trouble on the streets, teens now had a place to expend their pent-up energy."" tony tone, a member of the cold crush brothers, stated that ""hip hop saved a lot of lives"". for inner-city youth, participating in hip hop culture became a way of dealing with the hardships of life as minorities within america, and an outlet to deal with the risk of violence and the rise of gang culture. mc kid lucky mentions that ""people used to break-dance against each other instead of fighting"". inspired by dj kool herc, afrika bambaataa created a street organization called universal zulu nation, centered around hip hop, as a means to draw teenagers out of gang life, drugs and violence.the lyrical content of many early rap groups focused on social issues, most notably in the seminal track ""the message""  ""young black americans coming out of the civil rights movement have used hip hop culture in the 1980s and 1990s to show the limitations of the movement."" hip hop gave young african americans a voice to let their issues be heard; ""like rock-and-roll, hip hop is vigorously opposed by conservatives because it romanticizes violence, law-breaking, and gangs"". it also gave people a chance for financial gain by ""reducing the rest of the world to consumers of its social concerns.""in late 1979, debbie harry of blondie took nile rodgers of chic to such an event, as the main backing track used was the break from chics ""good times"". the new style influenced harry, and blondies later hit single from 1981 ""rapture"" became the first major single containing hip hop elements by a white group or artist to hit number one on the u.s. billboard hot 100, afrika bambaataa and the soulsonic force released the electro-funk track ""planet rock"". instead of simply rapping over disco beats, bambaataa and producer arthur baker created an electronic sound using the roland tr-808 drum machine and sampling from kraftwerk. ""planet rock"" is widely regarded as a turning point; fusing electro with hip hop, it was ""like a light being switched on,"" resulting in a new genre. the track also helped popularize the 808, which became a cornerstone of hip hop music; wired and slate both described the machine as hip hops equivalent to the fender stratocaster, which had dramatically influenced the development of rock music. released in 1986, licensed to ill by the beastie boys became the first rap lp to top the billboard album chart.other groundbreaking records released in 1982 include ""the message"" by grandmaster flash and the furious five, ""nunk"" by warp 9, ""hip hop, be bop encompassing graffiti art, mcing/rapping, djing and b-boying, hip hop became the dominant cultural movement of the minority-populated urban communities in the 1980s. the 1980s also saw many artists make social statements through hip hop. in 1982, melle mel and duke bootee recorded ""the message""  a song that foreshadowed the socially conscious statements of run-dmcs ""its like that"" and public enemys ""black steel in the hour of chaos"". during the 1980s, hip hop also embraced the creation of rhythm by using the human body, via the vocal percussion technique of beatboxing. pioneers such as doug e. fresh, biz markie and buffy from the fat boys made beats, rhythm, and musical sounds using their mouth, lips, tongue, voice, and other body parts. ""human beatbox"" artists would also sing or imitate turntablism scratching or other instrument sounds.the appearance of music videos changed entertainment: they often glorified urban neighborhoods. the music video for ""planet rock"" showcased the subculture of hip hop musicians, graffiti artists, and b-boys/b-girls. many hip hop-related films were released between 1982 and 1985, among them wild style, beat street, krush groove, breakin, and the documentary style wars. these films expanded the appeal of hip hop beyond the boundaries of new york. by 1984, youth worldwide were embracing the hip hop culture. the hip hop artwork and ""slang"" of u.s. urban communities quickly found its way to europe, as the cultures global appeal took root. the four traditional dances of hip hop are rocking, b-boying/b-girling, locking and popping, all of which trace their origins to the late 1960s or early 1970s.women artists have also been at the forefront of the hip hop movement since its inception in the bronx. nevertheless, as gangsta rap became the dominant force in hip hop music, there were many songs with misogynistic  since the turn of the century, female hip hop artists have struggled to get mainstream attention, with only a few, such as older artists like the female duo salt n pepa to more contemporary ones like lil kim and nicki minaj, reaching platinum status.with the commercial success of gangsta rap in the early 1990s, the emphasis in lyrics shifted to drugs, violence, and misogyny. early proponents of gangsta rap included groups and artists such as ice-t, who recorded what some consider to be the first gangster rap single, ""6 in the mornin"", and n.w.a whose second album niggaz4life became the first gangsta rap album to enter the charts at number one. gangsta rap also played an important part in hip hop becoming a mainstream commodity. considering albums such as n.w.as straight outta compton, eazy-es eazy-duz-it, and ice cubes amerikkkas most wanted were selling in such high numbers meant that black teens were no longer hip hops sole buying audience. as a result, gangsta rap became a platform for artists who chose to use their music to spread political and social messages to parts of the country that were previously unaware of the conditions of ghettos. while hip hop music now appeals to a broader demographic, media critics argue that socially and politically conscious hip hop has been largely disregarded by mainstream america.according to the u.s. department of state, hip hop is ""now the center of a mega music and fashion industry around the world"" that crosses social barriers and cuts across racial lines. national geographic recognizes hip hop as ""the worlds favorite youth culture"" in which ""just about every country on the planet seems to have developed its own local rap scene."" through its international travels, hip hop is now considered a ""global musical epidemic"".according to the village voice, hip hop is ""custom-made to combat the anomie that preys on adolescents wherever nobody knows their name.""hip hop sounds and styles differ from region to region, but there are also instances of fusion genres. hip hop culture has grown from the avoided genre to a genre that is followed by millions of fans worldwide. this was made possible by the adaptation of music in different locations, and the influence on style of behavior and dress. not all countries have embraced hip hop, where ""as can be expected in countries with strong local culture, the interloping wildstyle of hip hop is not always welcomed"". this is somewhat the case in jamaica, the homeland of the cultures father, dj kool herc. however, despite hip hop music produced on the island lacking widespread local and international recognition, artists such as five steez have defied the odds by impressing online hip hop taste-makers and even reggae critics.hartwig vens argues that hip hop can also be viewed as a global learning experience. author jeff chang argues that ""the essence of hip hop is the cipher, born in the bronx, where competition and community feed each other."" he also adds, ""thousands of organizers from cape town to paris use hip hop in their communities to address environmental justice, policing and prisons, media justice, and education."". while hip hop music has been criticized as a music that creates a divide between western music and music from the rest of the world, a musical ""cross pollination"" has taken place, which strengthens the power of hip hop to influence different communities. hip hops messages allow the under-privileged and the mistreated to be heard. these cultural translations cross borders. while the music may be from a foreign country, the message is something that many people can relate to- something not ""foreign"" at all.even when hip hop is transplanted to other countries, it often retains its ""vital progressive agenda that challenges the status quo."" in gothenburg, sweden, nongovernmental organizations in the early-to-mid 1980s, there wasnt an established hip hop music industry, as exists in the 2020s, with record labels, record producers, managers and artists and repertoire staff. politicians and businesspeople maligned and ignored the hip hop movement. most hip hop artists performed in their local communities and recorded in underground scenes. however, in the late 1980s, music industry executives realized that they could capitalize on the success of ""gangsta rap."" they made a formula that created ""a titillating buffet of hypermasculinity and glorified violence."" this type of rap was marketed to the new fan base: white males. they ignored the depictions of a harsh reality to focus on the sex and violence involved.in an article for the village voice, greg tate argues that the commercialization of hip hop is a negative and pervasive phenomenon, writing that ""what we call hiphop is now inseparable from what we call the hip hop industry, in which the nouveau riche and the super-rich employers get richer"". ironically, this commercialization coincides with a decline in rap sales and pressure from critics of the genre. even other musicians, like nas and krs-one have claimed ""hip hop is dead"" in that it has changed so much over the years to cater to the consumer that it has lost the essence for which it was originally created.however, in his book in search of africa, manthia diawara states that hip hop is really a voice of people who are marginalized in modern society. he argues that the ""worldwide spread of hip hop as a market revolution"" is actually global ""expression of poor peoples desire for the good life,"" and that this struggle aligns with ""the nationalist struggle for citizenship and belonging, but also reveals the need to go beyond such struggles and celebrate the redemption of the black individual through tradition."" the problem may not be that female rappers do not have the same opportunities and recognition as their male counterparts; it may be that the music industry that is so defined by gender biases. industry executives seem to bet on the idea that men wont want to listen to female rappers, so they are given fewer opportunities.as the hip hop genre has changed since the 1980s, the african-american cultural ""tradition"" that diawara describes has little place in hip hops mainstream artists music. the push toward materialism and market success by contemporary rappers such as rick ross, lil wayne and jay z has irked older hip hop fans and artists. they see the genre losing its community-based feel that focused more on black empowerment than wealth. the commercialization of the genre stripped it of its earlier political nature and the politics and marketing plans of major record labels have forced rappers to craft their music and images to appeal to white, affluent and suburban audiences.after realizing her friends were making music but not getting television exposure other than what was seen on video music box, darlene lewis as top rappers grow wealthier and start more outside business ventures, this can indicate a stronger sense of black aspiration. as rappers such as jay-z and kanye west establish themselves as artists and entrepreneurs, more young black people have hopes of achieving their goals. the lens through which one views the genres commercialization can make it seem positive or negative.white and latino pop rappers such as macklemore, iggy azalea, machine gun kelly, eminem, miley cyrus, g-eazy, pitbull, lil pump, and post malone have often been criticized for commercializing hip hop and cultural appropriation. miley cyrus and katy perry, although not rappers, have been accused of cultural appropriation and commercializing hip hop. katy perry, a white woman, was criticized for her hip hop song ""dark horse"". taylor swift was also accused of cultural appropriation.djing and turntablism, mcing/rapping, breakdancing, graffiti art and beatboxing are the creative outlets that collectively make up hip hop culture and its revolutionary aesthetic. like the blues, these arts were developed by african american communities to enable people to make a statement, whether political or emotional and participate in community activities. these practices spread globally around the 1980s as fans could ""make it their own"" and express themselves in new and creative ways in music, dance and other arts.djing and turntablism are the techniques of manipulating sounds and creating music and beats using two or more phonograph turntables  one of the first few hip hop djs was kool dj herc, who created hip hop in the 1970s through the isolation and extending of ""breaks""  the development of djing was also influenced by new turntablism techniques, such as beatmatching, a process facilitated by the introduction of new turntable technologies such as the technics sl-1200 mk 2, first sold in 1978, which had a precise variable pitch control and a direct drive motor. djs were often avid record collectors, who would hunt through used record stores for obscure soul records and vintage funk recordings. djs helped to introduce rare records and new artists to club audiences.in the early years of hip hop, the djs were the stars, as they created new music and beats with their record players. while djing and turntablism continue to be used in hip hop music in the 2010s, the star role has increasingly been taken by mcs since the late 1970s, due to innovative, creative mcs such as kurtis blow and melle mel of grandmaster flashs crew, the furious five, who developed strong rapping skills. however, a number of djs have gained stardom nonetheless in recent years. famous djs include grandmaster flash, afrika bambaataa, mr. magic, dj jazzy jeff, dj charlie chase, dj disco wiz, dj scratch from epmd, dj premier from gang starr, dj scott la rock from boogie down productions, dj pete rock of pete rock & cl smooth, dj muggs from cypress hill, jam master jay from run-dmc, eric b., dj screw from the screwed up click and the inventor of the chopped & screwed style of mixing music, funkmaster flex, tony touch, dj clue, mix master mike, touch-chill-out, dj red alert, and dj q-bert. the underground movement of turntablism has also emerged to focus on the skills of the dj. in the 2010s, there are turntablism competitions, where turntablists demonstrate advanced beat juggling and scratching skills.rapping  mcing, spitting  or just rhyming refers to ""spoken or chanted rhyming lyrics with a strong rhythmic accompaniment"". rapping typically features complex wordplay, rapid delivery, and a range of ""street slang"", some of which is unique to the hip hop subculture. while rapping is often done over beats, either done by a dj, a beatboxer, it can also be done without accompaniment. it can be broken down into different components, such as ""content"", ""flow""  rapping is distinct from spoken word poetry in that it is performed in time to the beat of the music. the use of the word ""rap"" to describe quick and slangy speech or witty repartee long predates the musical form. mcing is a form of expression that is embedded within ancient african and indigenous culture and oral tradition as throughout history verbal acrobatics or jousting involving rhymes were common within the afro-american and latino-american community.graffiti is the most controversial of hip hops elements, as a number of the most notable graffiti pioneers say that they do not consider graffiti to be an element of hip hop, including lady pink, seen, blade, fargo, cholly rock, fuzz one, and coco 144. lady pink says, ""i dont think graffiti is hip hop. frankly i grew up with disco music. theres a long background of graffiti as an entity unto itself,"" and fargo says, ""there is no correlation between hip hop and graffiti, one has nothing to do with the other."" hip hop pioneer grandmaster flash has also questioned the connection between hip hop and graffiti, saying, ""you know what bugs me, they put hip hop with graffiti. how do they intertwine?""in america in the late 1960s, before hip hop, graffiti was used as a form of expression by political activists. in addition, gangs such as the savage skulls, la familia michoacana, and savage nomads used graffiti to mark territory. julio 204 was a puerto rican graffiti writer, one of the first graffiti writers in new york city. he was a member of the ""savage skulls"" gang, and started writing his nickname in his neighborhood as early as 1968. in 1971 the new york times published an article  tagging began in philadelphia and new york city and has expanded worldwide.  spray painting public property or the property of others without their consent can be considered vandalism, and the ""tagger"" may be subject to arrest and prosecution for the criminal act.  whether legal or not, the hip hop culture considers tagging buildings, trains, bridges and other structures as visual art, and consider the tags as part of a complex symbol system with its own social codes and subculture rules. such art is in some cases now subject to federal protection in the us, making its erasure illegal.bubble lettering held sway initially among writers from the bronx, though the elaborate brooklyn style tracy 168 dubbed ""wildstyle"" would come to define the art. the early trend-setters were joined in the 1970s by artists like dondi, futura 2000, daze, blade, lee qui002 documentary film the freshest kids: a history of the b-boy, dj kool herc describes the ""b"" in b-boy as short for breaking, which at the time was slang for ""going off"", also one of the original names for the dance. however, early on the dance was known as the ""boing""  breaking was documented in style wars, and was later given more focus in fictional films such as wild style and beat street. early acts 000."" by rahzel of the roots.although it is not described as one of the four core elements that make up hip hop, music producing is another important element. in music, record producers play a similar role in sound recording that film directors play in making a movie. the record producer recruits and selects artists  the process of making beats includes sampling, ""chopping"", looping, sequencing beats, recording, mixing, and mastering.most beats in hip hop are sampled from a pre-existing record. this means that a producer will take a portion or a ""sample"" of a song and reuse it as an instrumental section, beat or portion of their song. some examples of this are the isley brothers ""footsteps in the dark pts. 1 and 2"" being sampled to make ice cubes ""today was a good day"". another example is otis reddings ""try a little tenderness"" being sampled to create the song ""otis"",  released in 2011, by kanye west and jay-z.""chopping"" is dissecting the song that you are sampling so that you ""chop"" out the part or parts of the song, be that the bassline, rhythm guitar part, drum break, or other music, you want to use in the beat. looping is known as melodic or percussive sequence that repeats itself over a period of time, so basically a producer will make an even-number of bars of a beat beats are such an integral part of rap music that many producers have been able to make instrumental mixtapes or albums. even though these instrumentals have no rapping, listeners still enjoy the inventive ways the producer mixes different beats, samples and instrumental melodies. examples of these are 9th wonders ""tutenkhamen"" and j dillas ""donuts"". some hip hop records come in two versions: a beat with rapping over it, and an instrumental with just the beat. the instrumental in this case is provided so that djs and turntablists can isolate breaks, beats and other music to create new songs.the development of hip hop linguistics is complex. source material include the spirituals of slaves arriving in the new world, jamaican dub music, the laments of jazz and blues singers, patterned cockney slang and radio deejays hyping their audience using rhymes. hip hop has a distinctive associated slang. it is also known by alternate names, such as ""black english"", or ""ebonics"". academics suggest its development stems from a rejection of the racial hierarchy of language, which held ""white english"" as the superior form of educated speech. due to hip hops commercial success in the late 1990s and early 2000s, many of these words have been assimilated into the cultural discourse of several different dialects across america and the world and even to non-hip hop fans. the word diss for example is particularly prolific. there are also a number of words which predate hip hop, but are often associated with the culture, with homie being a notable example. sometimes, terms like what the dilly, yo are popularized by a single song  not only the particular words, but also the choice of which language in which rap is widely debated topic in international hip hop. in canada, the use of non-standard variants of french, such as franglais, a mix of french and english, by groups such as dead obies or chiac  has powerful symbolic implications for canadian language politics and debates on canadian identity. in the united states rappers choose to rap in english, spanish, or spanglish, depending on their own backgrounds and their intended audience.hip hop has made a considerable social impact since its inception in the 1970s. ""hip hop has also become relevant to the field of education because of its implications for understanding language, learning, identity, and curriculum."" orlando patterson, a sociology professor at harvard university, helps describe the phenomenon of how hip hop has spread rapidly around the world. patterson argues that mass communication is controlled by the wealthy, the government, and major businesses in third world nations and countries around the world. he also credits mass communication with creating a global cultural hip hop scene. as a result, the youth are influenced by the american hip hop scene and start their own forms of hip hop. patterson believes that revitalization of hip hop music will occur around the world as traditional values are mixed with american hip hop music, and ultimately a global exchange process will develop that brings youth around the world to listen to a common musical form of hip hop.it has also been argued that rap music formed as a ""cultural response to historic oppression and racism, a system for communication among black communities throughout the united states"". this is due to the fact that the culture reflected the social, economic and political realities of the disenfranchised youth. in the 2010s, hip hop lyrics are starting to reflect original socially conscious themes. rappers are starting to question the governments power and its oppressive role in some societies. rap music has been a tool for political, social, and cultural empowerment outside the us. members of minority communities live crew filed a lawsuit against broward county sheriff nick navarro, because navarro wanted to prosecute stores that sold the groups album as nasty as they wanna be because of its obscene and vulgar lyrics. in june 1990, a u.s. district court judge labeled the album obscene and illegal to sell. however, in 1992, the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit overturned the obscenity ruling from judge gonzalez, and the supreme court of the united states refused to hear broward countys appeal. professor louis gates testified on behalf of the 2 live crew, arguing that the material that the county alleged was profane actually had important roots in african-american vernacular, games, and literary traditions and should be protected.gangsta rap is a subgenre of hip hop that reflects the violent culture of inner-city american black youths. the genre was pioneered in the mid-1980s by rappers such as schoolly d and ice-t, and was popularized in the later part of the 1980s by groups such as n.w.a. ice-t released ""6 in the mornin"", which is often regarded as the first gangsta rap song, in 1986. after the national attention that ice-t and n.w.a created in the late 1980s and early 1990s, gangsta rap became the most commercially lucrative subgenre of hip hop.n.w.a is the group most frequently associated with the founding of gangsta rap. their lyrics were more violent, openly confrontational, and shocking than those of established rap acts, featuring incessant profanity and, controversially, use of the word ""nigga"". these lyrics were placed over rough, rock guitar-driven beats, contributing to the musics hard-edged feel. the first blockbuster gangsta rap album was n.w.as straight outta compton, released in 1988. straight outta compton would establish west coast hip hop as a vital genre, and establish los angeles as a legitimate rival to hip hops long-time capital, new york city. straight outta compton sparked the first major controversy regarding hip hop lyrics when their song ""fuck tha police"" earned a letter from fbi assistant director milt ahlerich, strongly expressing law enforcements resentment of the song.controversy surrounded ice-ts song ""cop killer"" from the album body count. the song was intended to speak from the viewpoint of a criminal getting revenge on racist, brutal cops. ice-ts rock song infuriated government officials, the national rifle association and various police advocacy groups. consequently, time warner music refused to release ice-ts upcoming album home invasion because of the controversy surrounding ""cop killer"". ice-t suggested that the furor over the song was an overreaction, telling journalist chuck philips ""... theyve done movies about nurse killers and teacher killers and student killers.  arnold schwarzenegger blew away dozens of cops as the terminator. but i dont hear anybody complaining about that."" ice-t suggested to philips that the misunderstanding of ""cop killer"" and the attempts to censor it had racial overtones: ""the supreme court says its ok for a white man to burn a cross in public. but nobody wants a black man to write a record about a cop killer.""the white house administrations of both george bush senior and bill clinton criticized the genre. ""the reason why rap is under attack is because it exposes all the contradictions of american culture ... what started out as an underground art form has become a vehicle to expose a lot of critical issues that are not usually discussed in american politics. the problem here is that the white house and wanna-bes like bill clinton represent a political system that never intends to deal with inner city urban chaos,"" sister souljah told the times. until its discontinuation on july 8, 2006, bet ran a late-night segment titled bet: uncut to air nearly-uncensored videos. the show was exemplified by music videos such as ""tip drill"" by nelly, which was criticized for what many viewed as an exploitative depiction of women, particularly images of a man swiping a credit card between a strippers buttocks.public enemys ""gotta give the peeps what they need"" was censored on mtv, removing the words ""free mumia"". after the attack on the world trade center on september 11, 2001, oakland, california group the coup was under fire for the cover art on their album party music, which featured the groups two members holding a guitar tuner and two sticks as the twin towers exploded behind them despite the fact that it was created months before the actual event. the group, having politically radical and marxist lyrical content, said the cover meant to symbolize the destruction of capitalism. their record label pulled the album until a new cover could be designed.critics such as businessweeks david kiley argue that the discussion of products within hip hop culture may actually be the result of undisclosed product placement deals. such critics allege that shilling or product placement takes place in commercial rap music, and that lyrical references to products are actually paid endorsements. in 2005, a proposed plan by mcdonalds to pay rappers to advertise mcdonalds products in their music was leaked to the press. after russell simmons made a deal with courvoisier to promote the brand among hip hop fans, busta rhymes recorded the song ""pass the courvoisier"". simmons insists that no money changed hands in the deal.the symbiotic relationship has also stretched to include car manufacturers, clothing designers and sneaker companies, and many other companies have used the hip hop community to make their name or to give them credibility. one such beneficiary was jacob the jeweler, a diamond merchant from new york. jacob arabos clientele included sean combs, lil kim and nas. he created jewelry pieces from precious metals that were heavily loaded with diamond and gemstones. as his name was mentioned in the song lyrics of his hip hop customers, his profile quickly rose. arabo expanded his brand to include gem-encrusted watches that retail for hundreds of thousands of dollars, gaining so much attention that cartier filed a trademark-infringement lawsuit against him for putting diamonds on the faces of their watches and reselling them without permission. arabos profile increased steadily until his june 2006 arrest by the fbi on money laundering charges.while some brands welcome the support of the hip hop community, one brand that did not was cristal champagne maker louis roederer. a 2006 article from the economist magazine featured remarks from managing director frederic rouzaud about whether the brands identification with rap stars could affect their company negatively. his answer was dismissive: ""thats a good question, but what can we do? we cant forbid people from buying it. im sure dom p00,000 with well over 25,000 subscribers. the ""hip hop hit list"" was also the first to define hip hop as a culture introducing the many aspects of the art form such as fashion, music, dance, the arts and most importantly the language. for instance, on the cover the headliner included the tag ""all literature was produced to meet street comprehension!"" which proved their loyalty not only to the culture but also to the streets. most interviews were written verbatim which included their innovative broken english style of writing. some of the early charts were written in the graffiti format tag style but was made legible enough for the masses.the carroll brothers were also consultants to the many record companies who had no idea how to market hip hop music. vincent carroll, the magazines creator-publisher, went on to become a huge source for marketing and promoting the culture of hip hop, starting blow-up media, the first hip hop marketing firm with offices in nycs tribeca district. at the age of 21, vincent carroll employed a staff of 15 and assisted in launching some of the cultures biggest and brightest stars  later other publications spawned up including: hip hop connection, xxl, scratch, the source and vibe. many individual cities have also produced their own local hip hop newsletters, while hip hop magazines with national distribution are found in a few other countries. the 21st century also ushered in the rise of online media, and hip hop fan sites now offer comprehensive hip hop coverage on a daily basis.clothing, hair and other styles have been a big part of hip hops social and cultural impact since the 1970s. although the styles have changed over the decades, distinctive urban apparel and looks have been an important way for rappers, breakdancers and other hip hop community members to express themselves. as the hip hop music genres popularity increased, so did the effect of its fashion. while there were early items synonymous with hip hop that crossed over into the mainstream culture, like run-dmcs affinity for adidas or the wu-tang clans championing of clarks wallabees, it wasnt until its commercial peak that hip hop fashion became influential. starting in the mid- to late 1990s, hip hop culture embraced some major designers and established a new connection with classic fashion. brands such as ralph lauren, calvin klein and tommy hilfiger all tapped into hip hop culture and gave very little in return. moving into the new millennium, hip hop fashion consisted of baggy shirts, jeans, and jerseys. as names like pharrell and jay-z started their own clothing lines and still others like kanye west linked up with designers like louis vuitton, the clothes got tighter, more classically fashionable, and expensive.as hip hop has a seen a shift in the means by which its artists express their masculinity, from violence and intimidation to wealth-flaunting and entrepreneurship, it has also seen the emergence of rapper branding. the modern-day hip hop artist is no longer limited to music serving as their sole occupation or source of income. by the early 1990s, major apparel companies "" realized the economic potential of tapping into hip hop culture ... tommy hilfiger was one of the first major fashion designer who actively courted rappers as a way of promoting his street wear"". by joining forces, the artist and the corporation are able to jointly benefit from each others resources. hip hop artists are trend-setters and taste-makers. their fans range from minority groups who can relate to their professed struggles to majority groups who cannot truly relate but like to ""consume the fantasy of living a more masculine life"". the rappers provide the ""cool, hip"" factor while the corporations deliver the product, advertising, and financial assets. tommy hilfiger, one of the first mainstream designers to actively court rappers as a way of promoting his street wear, serves a prototypical example of the hip hip/fashion collaborations:in exchange for giving artists free wardrobes, hilfiger found its name mentioned in both rhyming verses of rap songs and their shout-out lyrics, in which rap artists chant out thanks to friends and sponsors for their support. hilfigers success convinced other large mainstream american fashion design companies, like ralph lauren and calvin klein, to tailor lines to the lucrative market of hip hop artists and fans.artists now use brands as a means of supplemental income to their music or are creating and expanding their own brands that become their primary source of income. as harry elam explains, there has been a movement ""from the incorporation and redefinition of existing trends to actually designing and marketing products as hip hop fashion"".hip hop music has spawned dozens of subgenres which incorporate hip hop music production approaches, such as sampling, creating beats, or rapping. the diversification process stems from the appropriation of hip hop culture by other ethnic groups. there are many varying social influences that affect hip hops message in different nations. it is frequently used as a musical response to perceived political and/or social injustices. in south africa the largest form of hip hop is called kwaito, which has had a growth similar to american hip hop. kwaito is a direct reflection of a post apartheid south africa and is a voice for the voiceless; a term that u.s. hip hop is often referred to. kwaito is even perceived as a lifestyle, encompassing many aspects of life, including language and fashion.kwaito is a political and party-driven genre, as performers use the music to express their political views, and also to express their desire to have a good time. kwaito is a music that came from a once hated and oppressed people, but it is now sweeping the nation. the main consumers of kwaito are adolescents and half of the south african population is under 21. some of the large kwaito artists have sold more than 100,000 albums, and in an industry where 25,000 albums sold is considered a gold record, those are impressive numbers. kwaito allows the participation and creative engagement of otherwise socially excluded peoples in the generation of popular media. south african hip hop has made an impact worldwide, with performers such as tumi, hiphop pantsula, tuks senganga.in jamaica, the sounds of hip hop are derived from american and jamaican influences. jamaican hip hop is defined both through dancehall and reggae music. jamaican kool herc brought the sound systems, technology, and techniques of reggae music to new york during the 1970s. jamaican hip hop artists often rap in both brooklyn and jamaican accents. jamaican hip hop subject matter is often influenced by outside and internal forces. outside forces such as the bling-bling era of todays modern hip hop and internal influences coming from the use of anti-colonialism and marijuana or ""ganja"" references which rastafarians believe bring them closer to god.author wayne marshall argues that ""hip hop, as with any number of african-american cultural forms before it, offers a range of compelling and contradictory significations to jamaican artist and audiences. from ""modern blackness"" to ""foreign mind"", transnational cosmopolitanism to militant pan-africanism, radical remixology to outright mimicry, hip hop in jamaica embodies the myriad ways that jamaicans embrace, reject, and incorporate foreign yet familiar forms.""in the developing world, hip hop has made a considerable impact in the social context. despite the lack of resources, hip hop has made considerable inroads. due to limited funds, hip hop artists are forced to use very basic tools, and even graffiti, an important aspect of the hip hop culture, is constrained due to its unavailability to the average person. hip hop has begun making inroads with more than black artists. there are number of other minority artists who are taking center stage as many first generation minority children come of age. one example is rapper awkwafina, an asian-american, who raps about being asian as well as being female. she, like many others, use rap to express her experiences as a minority not necessarily to ""unite"" minorities together but to tell her story.many hip hop artists from the developing world come to the united states to seek opportunities. maya arulpragasm  another music artist using hip hop to provide a positive message to young africans is emmanuel jal, a former child soldier from south sudan. jal is one of the few south sudanese music artists to have broken through on an international level with his unique form of hip hop and a positive message in his lyrics. jal has attracted the attention of mainstream media and academics with his story and use of hip hop as a healing medium for war-afflicted people in africa and he has also been sought out on the international lecture fora such as ted.many k-pop artists in south korea have been influenced by hip hop and many south korean artists perform hip hop music. in seoul, south korea, koreans b-boy.scholars argue that hip hop can have an empowering effect on youth. while there is misogyny, violence, and drug use in rap music videos and lyrics, hip hop also displays many positive themes of self-reliance, resilience, and self-esteem. these messages can be inspiring for a youth living in poverty. a lot of rap songs contain references to strengthening the african american community promoting social causes. social workers have used hip hop to build a relationship with at-risk youth and develop a deeper connection with the child. hip hop has the potential to be taught as a way of helping people see the world more critically, be it through forms of writing, creating music, or social activism. the lyrics of hip hop have been used to learn about literary devices such as metaphor, imagery, irony, tone, theme, motif, plot, and point of view.organizations and facilities are providing spaces and programs for communities to explore making and learning about hip hop. an example is the imp labs in regina, saskatchewan, canada. many dance studios and colleges now offer lessons in hip hop alongside tap and ballet, as well as krs-one teaching hip hop lectures at harvard university.hip hop producer 9th wonder and former rapper-actor christopher ""play"" martin from hip hop group kid-n-play have taught hip hop history classes at north carolina central university and 9th wonder has also taught a ""hip hop sampling soul"" class at duke university. in 2007, the cornell university library established a hip hop collection to collect and make accessible the historical artifacts of hip hop culture and to ensure their preservation for future generations.the hip-hop community has been a major factor in educating its listeners on hiv/aids, a disease that has affected the community very closely. one of the biggest artists of early hip-hop eazy-e, a member of n.w.a had died of aids in 1995. since then many artists, producers, choreographers and many others from many different locations have tried to make an impact and raise awareness of hiv in the hip-hop community. many artists have made songs as sort of psas to raise awareness of hiv for hip-hop listeners, some songs that raise awareness are salt n pepa 0th century and the ongoing racial discrimination faced by blacks.paul gilroy and alexander weheliye state that unlike disco, jazz, r&b, house music, and other genres that were developed in the african-american community and which were quickly adopted and then increasingly controlled by white music industry executives, hip hop has remained largely controlled by african american artists, producers and executives. in his book, phonographies, weheliye describes the political and cultural affiliations that hip hop music enables. in contrast, greg tate states that the market-driven, commodity form of commercial hip hop has uprooted the genre from the celebration of african-american culture and the messages of protest that predominated in its early forms. tate states that the commodification and commercialization of hip hop culture undermines the dynamism of the genre for african-american communities.these two dissenting understandings of hip hops scope and influence frame debates that revolve around hip hops possession of or lack of authenticity. anticipating the market arguments of tate and others, both gilroy and weheliye assert that hip hop has always had a different function than western popular music as a whole, a function that exceeds the constraints of market capitalism. weheliye notes, ""popular music, generally in the form of recordings, has and still continues to function as one of the main channels of communication between the different geographical and cultural points in the african diaspora, allowing artists to articulate and perform their diasporic citizenship to international audiences and establish conversations with other diasporic communities."" for paul gilroy, hip hop proves an outlet of articulation and a sonic space in which african americans can exert control and influence that they often lack in other sociopolitical and economic domains.in ""phonographies"", weheyliye explains how new sound technologies used in hip hop encourage ""diasporic citizenship"" and african-american cultural and political activities. gilroy states that the ""power of  music  in developing black struggles by communicating information, organizing consciousness, and testing out or deploying ... individual or collective"" forms of african-american cultural and political actions. in the third chapter of the black atlantic, ""jewels brought from bondage: black music and the politics of authenticity"", gilroy asserts that these elements influence the production of and the interpretation of black cultural activities. what gilroy calls the ""black atlantic"" musics rituals and traditions are a more expansive way of thinking about african-american ""blackness"", a way that moves beyond contemporary debates around essentialist and anti-essentialist arguments. as such, gilroy states that music has been and remains a central staging ground for debates over the work, responsibility, and future role of black cultural and artistic production.old-school hip hop performer dj kool herc, along with traditional hip hop artists afrika bambaataa and grandmaster caz, originally held views against mainstream rap. however, recent interviews indicate they have changed their ways to a certain extent. however, rappers like krs-one still feel a strong disapproval of the rap industry, especially through mainstream media.in b-boying, most supporters have begun to slowly involve more industry sponsorship through events on the world bboy series and through the udef powered by silverback open. other b-boys have begun to accept using the term breakdance, but only if the term b-boying is too difficult to communicate to the general public. regardless of such, b-boys and b-girls still exist to showing lack of support to jams and events that they feel represent the culture as a sport, form of entertainment and as well through capitalism. battle rap as an industry has also been strongly supported by old-school/ golden-era legends such as herc, kid capri and krs-one.in 2012, hip hop and rap pioneer chuck d, from the group public enemy criticized young hip hop artists from the 2010s, stating that they have taken a music genre with extensive roots in underground music and turned it into commercialized pop music. in particular, seminal figures in the early underground, politically motivated music, such as ice-t, have criticized current hip hop artists for being more concerned with image than substance. critics have stated that 2010s hip hop artists are contributing to cultural stereotyping of african-american culture and are poseur gangsters. critics have also stated that hip hop music promotes drug use and violence.hip hop has been criticized by rock-centric critics who state that hip hop is not a true art form and who state that rock and roll music is more authentic. these critics are advocating a viewpoint called ""rockism"" which favors music written and performed by the individual artist the hip hop music genre and its subculture has been criticized for its gender bias and its negative impacts on women in african-american culture. gangsta rap artists such as eazy-e, snoop dogg, and dr. dre have, primarily in the 90s, rapped lyrics that portray women as sex toys and inferior to or otherwise dependent upon men. between 1987 and 1993, over 400 hip hop songs had lyrics that described violence toward women including rape, assault, and murder. these anti-women hip hop lyrics have led some male listeners to make physical threats toward women and they have created negative stereotypes of young urban african-american women.hip hop music frequently promotes masculine hegemony and it depicts women as individuals who must rely on men. the portrayal of women in hip hop lyrics and videos tends to be violent, degrading, and highly sexualized. there is a high frequency of songs with lyrics that are demeaning, or depict sexual violence or sexual assault towards women. videos often portray idealized female bodies and depict women as being the object of male pleasure.the misrepresentation of women, primarily woman of color, as objects rather than other human beings and the presence of male dominance in hip hop extends back to the birth of the genre. however, many female artists have also emerged in shedding light on both their personal issues and the misrepresentations of women in hip-hip and culture. these artists include but are not limited to queen latifah, tlc and mc lyte. despite the success of them and others, female rappers remain proportionally few in the mainstream industry.very few female artists have been recognized in hip hop, and the most popular, successful and influential artists, record producers and music executives are males. women who are in rap groups, such as lauryn hill of the fugees, tend to have less advantages and opportunities than male artists.female artists have received significantly less recognition in hip hop. only one female artist has won best rap album of the year at the grammy awards since the category was added in 1995. in addition, african american female hip hop artists have been recognized even less in the industry. salt-n-pepa felt when they were establishing themselves as a successful group, they had to prove doubters wrong, stating that ""being women in hip hop at a time when it wasnt that many women, we felt like we had more to prove.""latinas, especially cuban, dominican and puerto rican women, are degraded and fetishized in hip hop.white women and asian women are also fetishized in hip hop but not as much as latinas, who are referred to as ""spanish"". latinas, especially puerto rican models and dominican models, are often portrayed as an object of sexual desire in hip hop videos.as well, the hip hop music community has been criticized with accusations of homophobia and transphobia. hip hop song lyrics contain offensive, homophobic slurs  many rappers and hip hop artists have advocated homophobia and/or transphobia. these artists include ja rule, who in an interview claimed,""we need to go step to mtv and viacom, and lets talk about all these fucking shows that they have on mtv that is promoting homosexuality, that my kids cant watch this shit,"" and rap artist erick sermon, who has said publicly,"" will never accept transgender rappers.""until the 2010s, hip hop music has excluded the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender  despite this prejudice, some queer/genderqueer rappers and hip hop artists have become successful and popular in the 2010s. one of the more notable members of the lgbt community in hip hop is frank ocean, who came out in 2012 and has released critically acclaimed albums and won two grammy awards. other successful queer hip hop/rap artists include female bisexual rapper azealia banks, pansexual androgynous rapper and singer angel haze, lesbian rapper siya, gay rapper/singer kevin abstract, and genderqueer rapper mykki blanco.having its roots in reggae, disco, funk and soul music, hip hop has since expanded worldwide. its expansion includes events like afrika bambaataas 1982 releasing of planet rock, which tried to establish a more global harmony. in the 1980s, the british slick rick became the first international hit hip hop artist not native to america. from the 1980s onward, television made hip hop global. from yo! mtv raps to public enemys world tour, hip hop spread to latin america and became a mainstream culture. hip hop has been cut, mixed and adapted as it the music spreads to new areas.early hip hop may have reduced inner-city gang violence by providing an alternative means of expression to physical violence. however, with the emergence of commercial and crime-related gangsta rap during the early 1990s, violence, drugs, weapons, and misogyny, were key themes. socially and politically conscious hip hop has long been disregarded by mainstream america in favor of its media-baiting sibling, gangsta rap.black female artists such as queen latifah, missy elliott, and mc lyte have made great strides since the hip hop industry first began. by producing music and an image that did not cater to the hyper-sexualized stereotypes of black women in hip hop, these women pioneered a revitalized and empowering image of black women in hip hop. though many hip hop artists have embraced the ideals that effectively disenfranchize black female artists, many others choose to employ forms of resistance that counteract these negative portrayals of women in hip hop and offer a different narrative. these artists seek to expand ways of traditional thinking through different ways of cultural expression. in this effort they hope to elicit a response to female hip hop artists not with a misogynist lens but with one that validates womens struggle.for women, artists such as missy elliott, lil kim, young m.a. and others are providing mentorship for new female mcs. in addition, there is a vibrant scene outside the mainstream that provides an opportunity for women and their music to flourish.",1,0

"forensic psychology, a subfield of psychology, involves the application of psychological knowledge and methods to both civil and criminal legal questions. traditionally, it has a broad definition as well as a narrow definition. the broader classification states that forensic psychology involves the application of all psychological areas of research to the legal field, while the narrower definition characterizes forensic psychology as \x80\x94in other words, the consultant must not choose a side to support and consequentially omit or create information that would be beneficial to one side or another. prior to accepting a case to work on, it is important that the forensic psychologist weigh the responsibilities of consulting on that case with the ethical guidelines put in place for the field of forensic psychology.expert testimony about matters relating to psychology is also an area in which forensic psychologists play an active role. unlike fact witnesses, who are limited to testifying about what they know or have observed, expert witnesses have the ability to express further knowledge of a situation or topic because, as their name suggests, they are presumed to be ""experts"" in a certain topic and possess specialized knowledge about it. expert witnesses in forensic psychology are called upon to testify on matters of mental health forensic psychologist researchers make scientific discoveries relevant to psychology and the law. these professionals usually have an advanced degree in psychology  forensic psychology research pertains to psychology and the law, whether it be criminal or civil. researchers test hypotheses empirically and apply the research to issues related to psychology and the law. they may also conduct research on mental health law and policy evaluation. some famous psychologists in the field include saul kassin, very widely known for studying false confessions, and elizabeth loftus, known for her research on eyewitness memory. she has provided expert witness testimony for many cases.academic forensic psychologists engage in teaching, researching, training, and supervision of students, among other education-related activities. these professionals also have an advanced degree in psychology  advocacy is another form of education, in which forensic psychologists use psychological research to influence laws and policies. these may be related to certain movements, such as black lives matter or the me too movement, or may even be related to certain civil rights that are being overlooked.competence, in a legal setting, refers to the defendants ability to appreciate and understand the charges against them and what is happening in the legal proceedings, as well as their ability to help the attorney understand and defend his or her case. while competence is assessed by a psychologist, its concern regarding a defendant is typically voiced by the attorney. though it is the psychologists responsibility to assess for competence, it is ultimately up to the judge to decide whether the defendant is competent or not. if the defendant is found incompetent to stand trial, the psychologist must then give a recommendation on whether or not the defendant can be restored to competence through treatment or if the charges should be dropped completely due to incompetence. a couple potential causes of incompetence includes certain types of brain damage or the occurrence of a psychotic episode preventing the individual from registering the reality around them.several cases were instrumental in developing a standard for competence, as well as for determining the rights of an individual deemed incompetent to stand trial. youtsey v. united states  in dusky v. united states  the case of weiter v. settle  as time has progressed, more cases have added to these guidelines and expectations when evaluating competency.insanity, as opposed to competence, refers to an individuals mental state at the time of the crime rather than at the time of the trial. according to legal principles of insanity, it is only acceptable to judge, find someone criminally responsible, and/or punish a defendant if that individual was sane at the time of the crime. in order to be considered sane, the defendant must have exhibited both mens rea and actus reus. mens rea, translated to ""guilty mind"" indicates that the individual exhibited free will and some intent to do harm at the time of the crime. actus reus refers to the voluntary committing of an unlawful act. the insanity defense acknowledges that, while an unlawful act did occur, the individual displayed a lack of mens rea. the burden of proof in determining if a defendant is insane lies with the defense team. a notable case relating to this type of assessment is that of ford v. wainwright, in which it was decided that forensic psychologists must be appointed to assess the competency of an inmate to be executed in death penalty cases.there are various definitions of insanity acknowledged within the legal system. the mnaghten/mcnaugton rule evaluating insanity involves using crime scene analysis to determine the mental state at the time of the crime, establishing a diagnosis, interviewing the defendant and any other relevant witnesses, and verifying impressions of the defendant. challenges associated with this type of assessment involve defendant malingering, determining the defendants past mental state, the chance that different experts may come to different conclusions depending on the assessment method used, and the fact that it is very common for society to label any psychological disorder as insane risk assessment evaluates how dangerous an individual is/could be and the risk of their re-offending after being released, also referred to as recidivism. typically, recidivism refers to violent or sex offending behavior. risk assessments affect the possibility of an inmate receiving parole and/or being released from prison and involve two general methods. the clinical prediction method involves using clinical judgement and experience to predict risk, while the actuarial prediction method utilizes a research-based formula to predict risk. two specific methods of risk assessment involve the violence risk appraisal guide while insanity and competency assessments are among the most common criminal assessments administered within the legal system, there are several other types implemented. some of these include death penalty case assessments, assessments of child sexual abuse, assessments for child custody or divorce cases, and civil court assessments.a forensic psychologists interactions with and ethical responsibilities to the client differ widely from those of a psychologist dealing with a client in a clinical setting.the ethical recommendations and expectations outlined for forensic psychology specifically are listed in the apas specialty guidelines for forensic psychology. these guidelines involve reminders that forensic psychologists should value integrity, impartiality, and fairness, as well as avoid conflicts of interest when possible. these conflicts of interest may arise in situations in which the psychologist is working as a consultant to one side or another in a court case, when the psychologist is required to testify or evaluate something that collides with their own beliefs or values, or when a psychologist is faced with the decision of choosing between playing the role of an individuals evaluator or treatment provider in a case. this final conflict of interest also relates to the ethical guidelines relating to having multiple relationships with clients. also as a standard of ethics, forensic psychologists are expected to offer a certain amount of reduced fee or pro bono services for individuals who may not be able to afford hiring a psychologist for a court case otherwise. other ethical guidelines involve receiving informed consent from clients before communicating information regarding their treatment or evaluations, respecting and acknowledging privacy/confidentiality/privilege among clients, remaining impartial and objective when involved in a trial, and weighing the moral and ethical costs of complying with any court orders that may conflict with professional standards.",1,0
"africa is the worlds second-largest and second-most populous continent, after asia in both cases. at about 30.3 million km2  with 1.3 billion people as of 2018, it accounts for about 16% of the worlds human population. africas population is the youngest amongst all the continents; the median age in 2012 was 19.7, when the worldwide median age was 30.4. despite a wide range of natural resources, africa is the least wealthy continent per capita, in part due to geographic impediments, legacies of european colonization in africa and the cold war, undemocratic rule and deleterious policies. despite this low concentration of wealth, recent economic expansion and the large and young population make africa an important economic market in the broader global context.the continent is surrounded by the mediterranean sea to the north, the isthmus of suez and the red sea to the northeast, the indian ocean to the southeast and the atlantic ocean to the west. the continent includes madagascar and various archipelagos. it contains 54 fully recognised sovereign states  the majority of the continent and its countries are in the northern hemisphere, with a substantial portion and number of countries in the southern hemisphere. africa is home to much biodiversity; it is the continent with the largest number of megafauna species, as it was least affected by the extinction of the pleistocene megafauna. however, africa also is heavily affected by a wide range of environmental issues, including desertification, deforestation, water scarcity, and other issues. these entrenched environmental concerns are expected to worsen as climate change impacts africa. the un intergovernmental panel on climate change has identified africa as the continent most vulnerable to climate change.africa, particularly eastern africa, is widely accepted as the place of origin of humans and the hominidae clade early human civilizations, such as ancient egypt and phoenicia emerged in north africa. following a subsequent long and complex history of civilizations, migration and trade, africa hosts a large diversity of ethnicities, cultures and languages. the last 400 years have witnessed an increasing european influence on the continent. starting in the 16th century, this was driven by trade, including the trans-atlantic slave trade, which created large african diaspora populations in the americas. in the late 19th century, european countries colonized almost all of africa, extracting resources from the continent and exploiting local communities; most present states in africa emerged from a process of decolonisation in the 20th century.afri was a latin name used to refer to the inhabitants of then-known northern africa to the west of the nile river, and in its widest sense referred to all lands south of the mediterranean  this name seems to have originally referred to a native libyan tribe, an ancestor of modern berbers; see terence for discussion. the name had usually been connected with the phoenician word 0th century, anthropologists discovered many fossils and evidence of human occupation perhaps as early as 7 million years ago  paranthropus boisei  and homo ergaster after the evolution of homo sapiens approximately 350,000 to 260,000 years bp in africa, the continent was mainly populated by groups of hunter-gatherers. these first modern humans left africa and populated the rest of the globe during the out of africa ii migration dated to approximately 50,000 years bp, exiting the continent either across bab-el-mandeb over the red sea, the strait of gibraltar in morocco, or the isthmus of suez in egypt.other migrations of modern humans within the african continent have been dated to that time, with evidence of early human settlement found in southern africa, southeast africa, north africa, and the sahara.the size of the sahara has historically been extremely variable, with its area rapidly fluctuating and at times disappearing depending on global climatic conditions. at the end of the ice ages, estimated to have been around 10,500 bc, the sahara had again become a green fertile valley, and its african populations returned from the interior and coastal highlands in sub-saharan africa, with rock art paintings depicting a fertile sahara and large populations discovered in tassili najjer dating back perhaps 10 millennia. however, the warming and drying climate meant that by 5000 bc, the sahara region was becoming increasingly dry and hostile. around 3500 bc, due to a tilt in the earths orbit, the sahara experienced a period of rapid desertification. the population trekked out of the sahara region towards the nile valley below the second cataract where they made permanent or semi-permanent settlements. a major climatic recession occurred, lessening the heavy and persistent rains in central and eastern africa. since this time, dry conditions have prevailed in eastern africa and, increasingly during the last 200 years, in ethiopia.the domestication of cattle in africa preceded agriculture and seems to have existed alongside hunter-gatherer cultures. it is speculated that by 6000 bc, cattle were domesticated in north africa. in the sahara-nile complex, people domesticated many animals, including the donkey and a small screw-horned goat which was common from algeria to nubia.between the 10,000,000 years. and by 500 bc, metalworking began to become commonplace in west africa. ironworking was fully established by roughly 500 bc in many areas of east and west africa, although other regions didnt begin ironworking until the early centuries ad. copper objects from egypt, north africa, nubia, and ethiopia dating from around 500 bc have been excavated in west africa, suggesting that trans-saharan trade networks had been established by this date.at about 3300 bc, the historical record opens in northern africa with the rise of literacy in the pharaonic civilization of ancient egypt. one of the worlds earliest and longest-lasting civilizations, the egyptian state continued, with varying levels of influence over other areas, until 343 bc. egyptian influence reached deep into modern-day libya and nubia, and, according to martin bernal, as far north as crete.an independent centre of civilization with trading links to phoenicia was established by phoenicians from tyre on the north-west african coast at carthage.european exploration of africa began with ancient greeks and romans. in 332 bc, alexander the great was welcomed as a liberator in persian-occupied egypt. he founded alexandria in egypt, which would become the prosperous capital of the ptolemaic dynasty after his death.following the conquest of north africas mediterranean coastline by the roman empire, the area was integrated economically and culturally into the roman system. roman settlement occurred in modern tunisia and elsewhere along the coast. the first roman emperor native to north africa was septimius severus, born in leptis magna in present-day libya,000 bc. about 500 stone settlements litter the region in the former savannah of the sahara. its inhabitants fished and grew millet. it has been found by augustin holl that the soninke of the mand00 ad the nok culture had vanished. and vanished under unknown circumstances around 500 ad, having lasted approximately 2,000 years. based on stylistic similarities with the nok terracottas, the bronze figurines of the yoruba kingdom of ife and those of the bini kingdom of benin are suggested to be continuations of the traditions of the earlier nok culture.pre-colonial africa possessed perhaps as many as 10,000 different states and polities characterized by many different sorts of political organization and rule. these included small family groups of hunter-gatherers such as the san people of southern africa; larger, more structured groups such as the family clan groupings of the bantu-speaking peoples of central, southern, and eastern africa; heavily structured clan groups in the horn of africa; the large sahelian kingdoms; and autonomous city-states and kingdoms such as those of the akan; edo, yoruba, and igbo people in west africa; and the swahili coastal trading towns of southeast africa.by the ninth century ad, a string of dynastic states, including the earliest hausa states, stretched across the sub-saharan savannah from the western regions to central sudan. the most powerful of these states were ghana, gao, and the kanem-bornu empire.  ghana declined in the eleventh century, but was succeeded by the mali empire which consolidated much of western sudan in the thirteenth century. kanem accepted islam in the eleventh century.in the forested regions of the west african coast, independent kingdoms grew with little influence from the muslim north. the kingdom of nri was established around the ninth century and was one of the first. it is also one of the oldest kingdoms in present-day nigeria and was ruled by the eze nri. the nri kingdom is famous for its elaborate bronzes, found at the town of igbo-ukwu. the bronzes have been dated from as far back as the ninth century.the kingdom of ife, historically the first of these yoruba city-states or kingdoms, established government under a priestly oba  the banu hilal and banu maqil were a collection of arab bedouin tribes from the arabian peninsula who migrated westwards via egypt between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries. their migration resulted in the fusion of the arabs and berbers, where the locals were arabized, and arab culture absorbed elements of the local culture, under the unifying framework of islam.following the breakup of mali, a local leader named sonni ali  by the eleventh century, some hausa states 0th centuries, the arab slave trade  in addition, more than 1 million europeans were captured by barbary pirates and sold as slaves in north africa between the 16th and 19th centuries.in west africa, the decline of the atlantic slave trade in the 1820s caused dramatic economic shifts in local polities. the gradual decline of slave-trading, prompted by a lack of demand for slaves in the new world, increasing anti-slavery legislation in europe and america, and the british royal navys increasing presence off the west african coast, obliged african states to adopt new economies. between 1808 and 1860, the british west africa squadron seized approximately 1,600 slave ships and freed 150,000 africans who were aboard.action was also taken against african leaders who refused to agree to british treaties to outlaw the trade, for example against ""the usurping king of lagos"", deposed in 1851. anti-slavery treaties were signed with over 50 african rulers. the largest powers of west africa the scramble for africa, also called the partition of africa, conquest of africa, or the rape of africa, was the invasion, occupation, division, and colonization of african territory by european powers during a short period known to historians as the new imperialism  ghana followed suit the next year  becoming the first of the sub-saharan colonies to be granted independence. most of the rest of the continent became independent over the next decade.portugals overseas presence in sub-saharan africa  also played a role in instability. when a country became independent for the first time, it was often expected to align with one of the two superpowers. many countries in northern africa received soviet military aid, while others in central and southern africa were supported by the united states, france or both. the 1970s saw an escalation of cold war intrigues, as newly independent angola and mozambique aligned themselves with the soviet union, and the west and south africa sought to contain soviet influence by supporting friendly regimes or insurgency movements. in rhodesia, soviet and chinese-backed leftist guerrillas of the zimbabwe patriotic front waged a brutal guerrilla war against the countrys white government. there was a major famine in ethiopia, when hundreds of thousands of people starved. some claimed that marxist economic policies made the situation worse. the most devastating military conflict in modern independent africa has been the second congo war; this conflict and its aftermath has killed an estimated 5.5 million people. since 2003 there has been an ongoing conflict in darfur which has become a humanitarian disaster. another notable tragic event is the 1994 rwandan genocide in which an estimated 800,000 people were murdered.in the 21st century, however, the number of armed conflicts in africa has steadily declined. for instance, the civil war in angola came to an end in 2002 after nearly 30 years. this coincided with many countries abandoning communist-style command economies and opening up for market reforms. the improved stability and economic reforms have led to a great increase in foreign investment into many african nations, mainly from china, which has spurred quick economic growth in many countries, seemingly ending decades of stagnation and decline. several african economies are among the worlds fastest growing as of 2016. a significant part of this growth, which is sometimes referred to as africa rising, can also be attributed to the facilitated diffusion of information technologies and specifically the mobile telephone. migration from african nations has increased dramatically in the last decade.africa is the largest of the three great southward projections from the largest landmass of the earth. separated from europe by the mediterranean sea, it is joined to asia at its northeast extremity by the isthmus of suez  the coastline is 26,0002"" w, the westernmost point, is a distance of approximately 7,4002 africa has over 3,000 protected areas, with 198 marine protected areas, 50 biosphere reserves, and 80 wetlands reserves. significant habitat destruction, increases in human population and poaching are reducing africas biological diversity and arable land. human encroachment, civil unrest and the introduction of non-native species threaten biodiversity in africa. this has been exacerbated by administrative problems, inadequate personnel and funding problems.deforestation is affecting africa at twice the world rate, according to the united nations environment programme  according to the university of pennsylvania african studies center, 31% of africas pasture lands and 19% of its forests and woodlands are classified as degraded, and africa is losing over four million hectares of forest per year, which is twice the average deforestation rate for the rest of the world. some sources claim that approximately 90% of the original, virgin forests in west africa have been destroyed. over 90% of madagascars original forests have been destroyed since the arrival of humans 2000 years ago. about 65% of africas agricultural land suffers from soil degradation.water in africa is an important issue encompassing the sources, distribution and economic uses of the water resources on the continent. overall, africa has about 9% of the worlds fresh water resources and 16% of the worlds population.  there are about 17 rivers in the african continent.among these rivers are the congo, nile, zambezi, niger and lake victoria, considered the world1st century by about 003, the bottom 24 ranked nations poverty, illiteracy, malnutrition and inadequate water supply and sanitation, as well as poor health, affect a large proportion of the people who reside in the african continent. in august 2008, the world bank announced revised global poverty estimates based on a new international poverty line of $1.25 per day sub-saharan africa is the least successful region of the world in reducing poverty  indicating increasing poverty in some areas. some of it is attributed to unsuccessful economic liberalization programmes spearheaded by foreign companies and governments, but other studies have cited bad domestic government policies more than external factors.africa is now at risk of being in debt once again, particularly in sub-saharan african countries.  the last debt crisis in 2005 was resolved with help from the heavily indebted poor countries scheme from 1995 to 2005, africas rate of economic growth increased, averaging 5% in 2005. some countries experienced still higher growth rates, notably angola, sudan and equatorial guinea, all of which had recently begun extracting their petroleum reserves or had expanded their oil extraction capacity.in a recently published analysis based on world values survey data, the austrian political scientist arno tausch maintained that several african countries, most notably ghana, perform quite well on scales of mass support for democracy and the market economy.tauschs global value comparison based on the world values survey derived the following factor analytical scales: 1. the non-violent and law-abiding society 2. democracy movement 3. climate of personal non-violence 4. trust in institutions 5. happiness, good health 6. no redistributive religious fundamentalism 7. accepting the market 8. feminism 9. involvement in politics 10. optimism and engagement 11. no welfare mentality, acceptancy of the calvinist work ethics. the spread in the performance of african countries with complete data, tausch concluded ""is really amazing"". while one should be especially hopeful about the development of future democracy and the market economy in ghana, the article suggests pessimistic tendencies for egypt and algeria, and especially for africas leading economy, south africa. high human inequality, as measured by the undps human development reports index of human inequality, further impairs the development of human security. tausch also maintains that the certain recent optimism, corresponding to economic and human rights data, emerging from africa, is reflected in the development of a civil society.the continent is believed to hold 90% of the worlds cobalt, 90% of its platinum, 50% of its gold, 98% of its chromium, 70% of its tantalite, 64% of its manganese and one-third of its uranium. the democratic republic of the congo  guinea is the worlds largest exporter of bauxite. as the growth in africa has been driven mainly by services and not manufacturing or agriculture, it has been growth without jobs and without reduction in poverty levels. in fact, the food security crisis of 2008 which took place on the heels of the global financial crisis pushed 100 million people into food insecurity.in recent years, the peoples republic of china has built increasingly stronger ties with african nations and is africas largest trading partner. in 2007, chinese companies invested a total of us$1 billion in africa.a harvard university study led by professor calestous juma showed that africa could feed itself by making the transition from importer to self-sufficiency. ""african agriculture is at the crossroads; we have come to the end of a century of policies that favoured africas export of raw materials and importation of food. africa is starting to focus on agricultural innovation as its new engine for regional trade and prosperity.""proportion of total african population by countryafricas population has rapidly increased over the last 40 years, and consequently, it is relatively young. in some african states, more than half the population is under 25 years of age. the total number of people in africa increased from 229 million in 1950 to 630 million in 1990. as of 2018, the population of africa is estimated at 1.3 billion . africas total population surpassing other continents is fairly recent; african population surpassed europe in the 1990s, while the americas was overtaken sometime around the year 2000; africas rapid population growth is expected to overtake the only two nations currently larger than its population, at roughly the same time 022. this increase in number of babies born in africa compared to the rest of the world is expected to reach approximately 37% in the year 2050, an increase of 21% since 1990 alone.speakers of bantu languages  but there are also several nilotic groups in south sudan and east africa, the mixed swahili people on the swahili coast, and a few remaining indigenous khoisan the peoples of west africa primarily speak niger, though many have since returned. the islands in the indian ocean are also populated primarily by people of asian origin, often mixed with africans and europeans. the malagasy people of madagascar are an austronesian people, but those along the coast are generally mixed with bantu, arab, indian and european origins. malay and indian ancestries are also important components in the group of people known in south africa as cape coloureds  have also developed in the larger coastal cities of west and east africa, respectively.africans profess a wide variety of religious beliefs, and statistics on religious affiliation are difficult to come by since they are often a sensitive topic for governments with mixed religious populations. according to the world book encyclopedia, islam and christianity are the two largest religions in africa. according to encyclop percent of the worlds population, more than two-thirds of the total infected worldwide 011. in the countries of sub-saharan africa most affected, aids has raised death rates and lowered life expectancy among adults between the ages of 20 and 49 by about twenty years. furthermore, the life expectancy in many parts of africa is declining, largely as a result of the hiv/aids epidemic with life-expectancy in some countries reaching as low as thirty-four years.some aspects of traditional african cultures have become less practised in recent years as a result of neglect and suppression by colonial and post-colonial regimes. for example, african customs were discouraged, and african languages were prohibited in mission schools. leopold ii of belgium attempted to ""civilize"" africans by discouraging polygamy and witchcraft.obidoh freeborn posits that colonialism is one element that has created the character of modern african art. according to authors douglas fraser and herbert m. cole, ""the precipitous alterations in the power structure wrought by colonialism were quickly followed by drastic iconographic changes in the art.""  fraser and cole assert that, in igboland, some art objects ""lack the vigor and careful craftsmanship of the earlier art objects that served traditional functions. author chika okeke-agulu states that ""the racist infrastructure of british imperial enterprise forced upon the political and cultural guardians of empire a denial and suppression of an emergent sovereign africa and modernist art.""  editors f. abiola irele and simon gikandi comment that the current identity of african literature had its genesis in the ""traumatic encounter between africa and europe."" on the other hand, mhoze chikowero believes that africans deployed music, dance, spirituality, and other performative cultures to there is now a resurgence in the attempts to rediscover and revalue african traditional cultures, under such movements as the african renaissance, led by thabo mbeki, afrocentrism, led by a group of scholars, including molefi asante, as well as the increasing recognition of traditional spiritualism through decriminalization of vodou and other forms of spirituality.african art describes the modern and historical paintings, sculptures, installations, and other visual culture from native or indigenous africans and the african continent. the definition may also include the art of the african diasporas, such as african american, caribbean or art in south american societies inspired by african traditions. despite this diversity, there are unifying artistic themes present, when considering the totality of the visual culture from the continent of africa.like other aspects of the culture of africa, the architecture of africa is exceptionally diverse. throughout the history of africa, africans have developed their own local architectural traditions. in some cases, broader regional styles can be identified, such as the sudano-sahelian architecture of west africa. a common theme in traditional african architecture is the use of fractal scaling: small parts of the structure tend to look similar to larger parts, such as a circular village made of circular houses.african architecture in some areas has been influenced by external cultures for centuries, according to available evidence. western architecture has influenced coastal areas since the late 15th century and is now an important source of inspiration for many larger buildings, particularly in major cities.african music is a tradition mainly played at gatherings at special occasions. the traditional music of africa, given the vastness of the continent, is historically ancient, rich and diverse, with different regions and nations of africa having many distinct musical traditions.  music in africa is very important when it comes to religion.  songs and music are used in rituals and religious ceremonies, to pass down stories from generation to generation, as well as to sing and dance to.african dance also known popularly as ""afro"" refers mainly to the dance of sub-saharan africa, and more appropriately african dances because of the many cultural differences in musical and movement styles. these dances must be viewed in close connection with sub-saharan african music traditions and bantu cultivation of rhythm. african dance utilizes the concept of as well as total body articulation.fifty-four african countries have football teams in the confederation of african football. egypt has won the african cup seven times, and a record-making three times in a row. cameroon, nigeria, senegal, ghana, and algeria have advanced to the knockout stage of recent fifa world cups. south africa hosted the 2010 world cup tournament, becoming the first african country to do so.in recent years, the continent has made major progress in terms of state of the art basketball facilities which have been built in cites as diverse as cairo, dakar, johannesburg, kigali, luanda and rades.cricket is popular in some african nations. south africa and zimbabwe have test status, while kenya is the leading non-test team and previously had one-day international cricket (odi status (from 10 october 1997, until 30 january 2014. the three countries jointly hosted the 2003 cricket world cup. namibia is the other african country to have played in a world cup. morocco in northern africa has also hosted the 2002 morocco cup, but the national team has never qualified for a major tournament. rugby is a popular sport in south africa, namibia, and zimbabwe.the countries in this table are categorized according to the scheme for

"rock climbing is a sport in which participants climb up, down or across natural rock formations or artificial rock walls. the goal is to reach the summit of a formation or the endpoint of a usually pre-defined route without falling. rock climbing is a physically and mentally demanding sport, one that often tests a climbers strength, endurance, agility and balance along with mental control. knowledge of proper climbing techniques and the use of specialized climbing equipment is crucial for the safe completion of routes.because of the wide range and variety of rock formations around the world, rock climbing has been separated into several different styles and sub-disciplines, such as scrambling, another activity involving the scaling of hills and similar formations, differentiated by rock climbings sustained use of hands to support the climbers weight as well as to provide balance.professional rock climbing competitions have the objectives of either completing the route in the quickest possible time or attaining the farthest point on an increasingly difficult route.paintings dating from 200 bc show chinese men rock climbing. in early america, the cliff-dwelling anasazi in the 12th century are thought to have been excellent climbers. early european climbers used rock climbing techniques as a skill required to reach the summit in their mountaineering exploits. in the 1880s, european rock climbing became an independent pursuit outside of mountain climbing.although rock climbing was an important component of victorian mountaineering in the alps, it is generally thought that the sport of rock climbing began in the last quarter of the nineteenth century in various parts of europe. rock climbing evolved gradually from an alpine necessity to a distinct athletic activity.aid climbing, climbing using equipment that acts as artificial handhold or footholds, became popular during the period 1920016, the international olympic committee  the event debut was postponed to 2021, due to covid-19.in how to rock climb, john long writes that for moderately skilled climbers simply getting to the top of a route is not enough- how one gets to the top matters. within free climbing, there are distinctions given to ascents: on-sight, flash, and redpoint. to on-sight a route is to ascend the wall without aid or any foreknowledge. flashing is similar to on-sighting, except that the climber has previous information about the route including talking about the beta with other climbers. redpointing means to make a free ascent of the route after having first tried it. style is mostly up to each individual climber and even among climbers the verbiage and definitions can differ. climbers can be more dynamic  left is .as climbing routes or problems increase in difficulty, climbers learn to develop skills that help them complete the climbs clean. there are several techniques for hands and feet as well as terms for motions that combine the two. for indoor gyms, route setters visualize and create routes for climbers, placing different kinds of holds in specific parts of the wall at particular angles because they intend climbers to use certain techniques.indoor climbing occurs in buildings on artificial rock structures. this permits for climbing in all types of weather and at all times of the day. climbers climb indoors to improve their skills and techniques, as well as for general exercise or fun. indoor climbing gyms typically provide rope setups and ensure that new climbers know safe techniques.outdoors, climbs usually take place on sunny days when the holds are dry and provide the best grip, but climbers can also attempt to climb at night or in adverse weather conditions if they have the proper training and equipment. however, night climbing or climbing in adverse weather conditions will increase the difficulty and danger on any climbing route.most climbers choose to wear specialized rubber climbing shoes which are often of a smaller size than their normal street shoes in order to improve sensitivity towards foot placements and use the tightness to their advantage.  climbing chalk injuries in rock climbing are mainly sports injuries that occur due to falls or overuse. injuries due to falls are relatively uncommon; the vast majority of injuries result from overuse, most often occurring in the fingers, elbows, and shoulders. such injuries are often no worse than torn calluses, cuts, burns and bruises. there are a number of skincare products specifically for climbers available in the market. however, overuse symptoms, if ignored, may lead to permanent damage especially to tendons, tendon sheaths, ligaments, and capsules. taping of fingers and elbows to prevent injuries is common practice and there are various techniques for taping.illustrated photo-topos are widely used in rock climbing. many of them are found in climbing and mountaineering guidebooks such as those published by rockfax, or the british mountaineering council. full-colour photo-topo diagrams have replaced the previous generation of text based guidebooks, which were illustrated with hand-drawn diagrams. the use of drones has helped improve the quality of images of many of the cliffs.some areas that are popular for climbing, for example in the united states and australia, are also sacred places for indigenous peoples.  many such indigenous people would prefer that climbers not climb these sacred places and have made this information well known to climbers.  a well-known example is the rock formation that americans have named devils tower national monument. native american cultural concerns also led to complete climbing closures at cave rock at lake tahoe, monument valley, shiprock and canyon de chelly.climbing activities can sometimes encroach on rock art sites created by various native american cultures and early european explorers and settlers. the potential threat to these resources has led to climbing restrictions and closures in places like hueco tanks, texas, and portions of city of rocks national reserve, idaho.in australia, the monolith uluru many significant rock outcrops exist on private land. some people within the rock climbing community have been guilty of trespassing in many cases, often after land ownership transfers and previous access permission is withdrawn. in the u.s. the climbing community responded to access closures by forming the access fund. this is an ""advocacy organization that keeps u.s. climbing areas open and conserves the climbing environment. five core programs support the mission on national and local levels: public policy, stewardship and conservation  in the u.k. the british mountaineering council represents climbers and their interest of public access to crags, cliffs and boulders.although many climbers adhere to ""minimal impact"" and ""leave no trace"" practices, rock climbing is sometimes damaging to the environment.  common environmental damages include: soil erosion, breaking rock features, chalk accumulation, litter, abandoned bolts and ropes, human excrement, introduction of foreign plants through seeds on shoes and clothing, as well as damage to native plant species many non-climbers also object to the appearance of climbing chalk marks, anchors, bolts and slings on visible cliffs. since these features are small, visual impacts can be mitigated through the selection of neutral, rock-matching colors for bolt hangers, webbing and chalk. the use of certain types of climbing gear is banned altogether at some crags due to the risk of damage to the rock face. in such cases,  climbers use knotted slings and ropes for climbing protection.blowtorching is another climbing induced impact that affects the rocks themselves. blowtorching is when a climber uses a blowtorch to dry holds on a wet route. this mainly happens in areas that tend to have wet climbing conditions. blowtorching is not only detrimental to the rock itself and can have permanent damage but it also leaves a very large burn mark that most non-climbers would object to the appearance of.the most significant form of vandalism directly attributable to rock climbers is the alteration of the climbing surface to render it more climber-friendly.with the advent of hard, bolted sport climbing in the 1980s, many routes were ""chipped"" and ""glued"" to provide additional features, allowing them to be climbed at the standard of the day. this attitude quickly changed as the safer sport climbing technique allowed climbers to push hard without much risk, causing the formerly more-or-less fixed grades to steadily rise. altering routes began to be seen as limiting and pointless.unlike traditional climbing which generally uses protection only as a backup in case of falls, some forms of climbing\x80\x94rely heavily on artificial protection to advance, either by frequent falls or by directly pulling on the gear. often these types of climbing involve multiple drilled holes in which to place temporary bolts and rivets, but in recent years an emphasis on clean techniques has grown.today, the charge of vandalism in climbing is more often a disagreement about the appropriateness of drilling and placing permanent bolts and other anchors. although new fixed anchors are rarely placed by climbers, their dependency on the existing fixed anchors results in the difference between life and death. but the existing anchors remain on the climbing structure for long periods of time, changing the dynamic of the structure itself. due to the permanent impact of the fixed anchors in wilderness areas, it was prohibited by the wilderness act. however, in 1990, there was a movement by the forest service and the task group to change the regulations such that fixed anchors would be allowed but still regulated in wilderness areas. these improvements led to protection for both the climbers and the wilderness act. typically in the usa, the first ascensionists decide where to place protection on a new route and later climbers are supposed to live with these choices. this can cause friction and retro-bolting when the route is perceived to be dangerous to climbers who actually lead at the grade of the climb, since the first ascensionists often lead at a higher grade and therefore do not require as much protection. failing to properly design a new route at its grade is considered arrogant and very poor form. even in strongholds of rock-climbing tradition like yosemite national park, many routes are being gradually upgraded to safer standards of protection.",1,0
"mount everest   its elevation mount everest attracts many climbers, some of them highly experienced mountaineers. there are two main climbing routes, one approaching the summit from the southeast in nepal , over 300 people have died on everest, many of whose bodies remain on the mountain.the first recorded efforts to reach everests summit were made by british mountaineers. as nepal did not allow foreigners to enter the country at the time, the british made several attempts on the north ridge route from the tibetan side. after the first reconnaissance expedition by the british in 1921 reached 7,000, the british began the great trigonometric survey of india to fix the locations, heights, and names of the worlds highest mountains. starting in southern india, the survey teams moved northward using giant theodolites, each weighing 5004000, stationed at the survey headquarters in dehradun, radhanath sikdar, an indian mathematician and surveyor from bengal was the first to identify everest as the worlds highest peak, using trigonometric calculations based on nicolsons measurements. an official announcement that peak019 to determine if the april 2015 nepal earthquake affected the height of the mountain.in 1955, the elevation of 8,848001, it has not been officially recognised by nepal, this figure is widely quoted. geoid uncertainty casts doubt upon the accuracy claimed by both the 1999 and 2005  surveys.in 1955, a detailed photogrammetric map on 9 october 2005, after several months of measurement and calculation, the chinese academy of sciences and state bureau of surveying and mapping announced the height of everest as 8,844.43020, it was jointly announced by the two countries that the new official height is 8,848.860000,16868000 to 240 kilometres  the himalayas are rising by about 5018, vegetation is expanding in the everest region. researchers have found plants in areas that were previously deemed bare.euophrys omnisuperstes, a minute black jumping spider, has been found at elevations as high as 6,700 metres birds, such as the bar-headed goose, have been seen flying at the higher altitudes of the mountain, while others, such as the chough, have been spotted as high as the south col at 7,920 metres  yellow-billed choughs have been seen as high as 7,900 metres  in 1953, george lowe yaks are often used to haul gear for mount everest climbs. they can haul 100008, a new weather station at about 8,000 m altitude  the stations first data in may 2008 were air temperature 17004, a wind speed of 2804, although this has never been confirmed, as both of the men making the attempt failed to return from the mountain. several climbing routes has been established over several decades of climbing expeditions to the mountain.everests first known summiting occurred by 1953, and interest by climbers increased. despite the effort and attention poured into expeditions, only about 200 people had sumitted by 1987. everest remained a difficult climb for decades, even for serious attempts by professional climbers and large national expeditions, which were the norm until the commercial era began in the 1990s.by march 2012, everest had been climbed 5,656 times with 223 deaths. although lower mountains have longer or steeper climbs, everest is so high the jet stream can hit it. climbers can be faced with winds beyond 320013, the himalayan database recorded 6,871 summits by 4,042 different people.in 1885, clinton thomas dent, president of the alpine club, suggested that climbing mount everest was possible in his book above the snow line.the northern approach to the mountain was discovered by george mallory and guy bullock on the initial 1921 british reconnaissance expedition. it was an exploratory expedition not equipped for a serious attempt to climb the mountain. with mallory leading  for leading a group down from the north col which got caught in an avalanche. mallory was pulled down too but survived. seven native porters were killed.the next expedition was in 1924. the initial attempt by mallory and geoffrey bruce was aborted when weather conditions prevented the establishment of camp0s and hugh ruttledges two unsuccessful attempts in 1933 and 1936 swiss mount everest expedition, led by edouard wyss-dunant, was granted permission to attempt a climb from nepal. it established a route through the khumbu icefall and ascended to the south col at an elevation of 7,986 june. a few days later, the queen gave orders that hunt  tenzing, a nepali sherpa who was a citizen of india, was granted the george medal by the uk. hunt was ultimately made a life peer in britain, while hillary became a founding member of the order of new zealand. hillary and tenzing have also been recognised in nepal. in 2009, statues were raised in their honor, and in 2014, hillary peak and tenzing peak were named for them.on 23 may 1956 ernst schmied and juerg marmet ascended. this was followed by d4 may 1957. wang fuzhou, gonpo and qu yinhua of china made the first reported ascent of the peak from the north ridge on 25 may 1960. the first american to climb everest, jim whittaker, joined by nawang gombu, reached the summit on 1 may 1963.in 1970 japanese mountaineers conducted a major expedition. the centerpiece was a large ""siege""-style expedition led by saburo matsukata, working on finding a new route up the southwest face. another element of the expedition was an attempt to ski mount everest. despite a staff of over one hundred people and a decade of planning work, the expedition suffered eight deaths and failed to summit via the planned routes. however, japanese expeditions did enjoy some successes. for example, yuichiro miura became the first man to ski down everest from the south col  miuras exploits became the subject of film, and he went on to become the oldest person to summit mount everest in 2003 at age 70 and again in 2013 at the age of 80.in 1975, junko tabei, a japanese woman, became the first woman to summit mount everest.in 1978, reinhold messner and peter habeler made the first ascent of everest without supplemental oxygen.the polish climber andrzej zawada headed the first winter ascent of mount everest, the first winter ascent of an eight-thousander. the team of 20 polish climbers and 4 sherpas established a base camp on khumbu glacier in early january 1980. on 15 january, the team managed to set up camp iii at 7150 meters above sea level, but further action was stopped by hurricane-force winds. the weather improved after 11 february, when leszek cichy, walenty fiut and krzysztof wielicki set up camp iv on south col  the successful winter ascent of mount everest started a new decade of winter himalaism, which became a polish specialisation. after 1980 poles did ten first winter ascents on 8000 metre peaks, which earned polish climbers a reputation of ""ice warriors"".in may 1989, polish climbers under the leadership of eugeniusz chrobak organised an international expedition to mount everest on a difficult western ridge. ten poles and nine foreigners participated, but ultimately only the poles remained in the attempt for the summit. on 24 may, chrobak and andrzej marciniak, starting from camp v at 8,200 m, overcame the ridge and reached the summit. but on 27 may in the avalanche from the wall khumbutse on the lho la pass, four polish climbers were killed: mirosaw daw gardzielewski, zygmunt andrzej heinrich and wacaw otr014 mount everest avalanche. the guiding disaster gained wide publicity and raised questions about the commercialization of climbing and the safety of guiding clients on mount everest.journalist jon krakauer, on assignment from outside magazine, was in one of the affected guided parties, and afterward published the bestseller into thin air, which related his experience. anatoli boukreev, a guide who felt impugned by krakauers book, co-authored a rebuttal book called the climb. the dispute sparked a debate within the climbing community.in may 2004, kent moore, a physicist, and john l. semple, a surgeon, both researchers from the university of toronto, told new scientist magazine that an analysis of weather conditions on 11 may suggested that weather caused oxygen levels to plunge approximately 14 percent.one of the survivors was beck weathers, an american client of new zealand-based guide service adventure consultants. weathers was left for dead about 275 metres  when he arrived at camp 4, fellow climbers considered his condition terminal and left him in a tent to die overnight.weathers condition had not improved and an immediate descent to a lower elevation was deemed essential. a helicopter rescue was out of the question: camp 4 was higher than the rated ceiling of any available helicopter. weathers was lowered to camp 2. eventually, a helicopter rescue was organised thanks to the nepali army.the storms impact on climbers on the north ridge of everest, where several climbers also died, was detailed in a first-hand account by british filmmaker and writer matt dickinson in his book the other side of everest. 16-year-old mark pfetzer was on the climb and wrote about it in his account, within reach: my everest story.the 2015 feature film everest, directed by baltasar korm006 12 people died. one death in particular  the season was also remembered for the rescue of lincoln hall who had been left by his climbing team and declared dead, but was later discovered alive and survived being helped off the mountain.there was an international controversy about the death of a solo british climber david sharp, who attempted to climb mount everest in 2006 but died in his attempt. the story broke out of the mountaineering community into popular media, with a series of interviews, allegations, and critiques. the question was whether climbers that season had left a man to die and whether he could have been saved. he was said to have attempted to summit mount everest by himself with no sherpa or guide and fewer oxygen bottles than considered normal. he went with a low-budget nepali guide firm that only provides support up to base camp, after which climbers go as a ""loose group"", offering a high degree of independence. the manager at sharps guide support said sharp did not take enough oxygen for his summit attempt and did not have a sherpa guide. it is less clear who knew sharp was in trouble, and if they did know, whether they were qualified or capable of helping him.double-amputee climber mark inglis said in an interview with the press on 23 may 2006, that his climbing party, and many others, had passed sharp, on 15 may, sheltering under a rock overhang 450 metres  inglis said 40 people had passed by sharp, but he might have been overlooked as climbers assumed sharp was the corpse nicknamed ""green boots"", but inglis was not aware that turkish climbers had tried to help sharp despite being in the process of helping an injured woman down   comparatively, most expeditions are between $35,000 to us$100,000 plus an additional $20,000 in other expenses that range from gear to bonuses.  it was estimated on 14 may that sharp summitted mount everest and began his descent down, but 15 may he was in trouble but being passed by climbers on their way up and down.  on 15 may 2006 it is believed he was suffering from hypoxia and was about 1,000 feet from the summit on the north side route.""dawa from arun treks also gave oxygen to david and tried to help him move, repeatedly, for perhaps an hour. but he could not get david to stand alone or even stand to rest on his shoulders, and crying, dawa had to leave him too. even with two sherpas, it was not going to be possible to get david down the tricky sections below.""some climbers who left him said that the rescue efforts would have been useless and only have caused more deaths. beck weathers of the 1996 mount everest disaster said that those who are dying are often left behind and that he himself had been left for dead twice but was able to keep walking. the tribune of india quoted someone who described what happened to sharp as ""the most shameful act in the history of mountaineering"".  in addition to sharps death, at least nine other climbers perished that year, including multiple sherpas working for various guiding companies.""you are never on your own. there are climbers everywhere.""much of this controversy was captured by the discovery channel while filming the television program everest: beyond the limit. a crucial decision affecting the fate of sharp is shown in the program, where an early returning climber lebanese adventurer maxim chaya is descending from the summit and radios to his base camp manager  sharps body was removed from the cave in 2007, according to the bbc, and since 2014, green boots has been missing, presumably removed or buried.as the sharp debate kicked off on 26 may 2006, australian climber lincoln hall was found alive after being left for dead the day before. he was found by a party of four climbers  there were no rocks around to do this and he was abandoned. the erroneous information of his death was passed on to his family. the next day he was discovered by another party alive.i was shocked to see a guy without gloves, hat, oxygen bottles or sleeping bag at sunrise at 28,200-feet height, just sitting up there.lincoln greeted his fellow mountaineers with this:i imagine you are surprised to see me here.lincoln hall went on to live for several more years, often giving talks about his near-death experience and rescue, before dying from unrelated medical issues in 2012 at the age of 56 heroic rescue actions have been recorded since hall, including on 21 may 2007, when canadian climber meagan mcgrath initiated the successful high-altitude rescue of nepali usha bista. recognising her heroic rescue, major meagan mcgrath was selected as a 2011 recipient of the sir edmund hillary foundation of canada humanitarian award, which recognises a canadian who has personally or administratively contributed a significant service or act in the himalayan region of nepal.by the end of the 2010 climbing season, there had been 5,104 ascents to the summit by about 3,142 individuals, with 77% of these ascents being accomplished since 2000. the summit was achieved in 7 of the 22 years from 1953 to 1974 and was not missed between 1975 and 2014. in 2007, the record number of 633 ascents was recorded, by 350 climbers and 253 sherpas.an illustration of the explosion of popularity of everest is provided by the numbers of daily ascents. analysis of the 1996 mount everest disaster shows that part of the blame was on the bottleneck caused by a large number of climbers there have been 219 fatalities recorded on mount everest from the 1922 british mount everest expedition through the end of 2010, a rate of 4.3 fatalities for every 100 summits  though the rate of fatalities has decreased since the year 2000 nearly all attempts at the summit are done using one of the two main routes. the traffic seen by each route varies from year to year. in 2005008, the northeast route was closed by the chinese government for the entire climbing season, and the only people able to reach the summit from the north that year were athletes responsible for carrying the olympic torch for the 2008 summer olympics. the route was closed to foreigners once again in 2009 in the run-up to the 50th anniversary of the dalai lamas exile. these closures led to declining interest in the north route, and, in 2010, two-thirds of the climbers reached the summit from the south.the 2010s were a time of new highs and lows for the mountain, with back to back disasters in 2013 and 2014 causing record deaths. in 2015 there were no summits for the first time in decades. however, other years set records for numbers of summits013s record number of summiters, around 667, was surpassed in 2018 with around 800 summiting the peak, and a subsequent record was set in 2019 with over 890 summiters.on 18 april 2014, an avalanche hit the area just below the base camp 2 at around 01:00 utc  sixteen people were killed in the avalanche during the season, a 13-year-old girl, malavath purna, reached the summit, becoming the youngest female climber to do so. additionally, one team used a helicopter to fly from south base camp to camp 2 to avoid the khumbu icefall, then reached the everest summit.  this team had to use the south side because the chinese had denied them a permit to climb.  a team member  she was named the nepali ""international mountaineer of the year"".over 100 people summited everest from china  this included 72-year-old bill burke, the indian teenage girl, and a chinese woman jing wang. another teen girl summiter was ming kipa sherpa who summited with her elder sister lhakpa sherpa in 2003, and who had achieved the most times for woman to the summit of mount everest at that time.  effectively shutting down the everest climbing season. 18 bodies were recovered from mount everest by the indian army mountaineering team. the avalanche began on pumori, moved through the khumbu icefall on the southwest side of mount everest, and slammed into the south base camp. 2015 was the first time since 1974 with no spring summits, as all climbing teams pulled out after the quakes and avalanche. one of the reasons for this was the high probability of aftershocks  just weeks after the first quake, the region was rattled again by a 7.3 magnitude quake and there were also many considerable aftershocks.the quakes trapped hundreds of climbers above the khumbu icefall, and they had to be evacuated by helicopter as they ran low on supplies. the quake shifted the route through the ice fall, making it essentially impassable to climbers. bad weather also made helicopter evacuation difficult. the everest tragedy was small compared the impact overall on nepal, with almost nine thousand dead and about 22,000 injured. in tibet, by 28 april at least 25 had died, and 117 were injured. by 29 april 2015, the tibet mountaineering association  on the south side, helicopters evacuated 180 people trapped at camps 1 and 2.on 24 august 2015 nepal re-opened everest to tourism including mountain climbers. the only climber permit for the autumn season was awarded to japanese climber nobukazu kuriki, who had tried four times previously to summit everest without success. he made his fifth attempt in october, but had to give up just 700016.2017 was the biggest season yet, permit-wise, yielding hundreds of summiters and a handful of deaths. on 27 may 2017, kami rita sherpa made his 21st climb to the summit with the alpine ascents everest expedition, one of three people in the world along with apa sherpa and phurba tashi sherpa to make it to the summit of mount everest 21 times. the season had a tragic start with the death of ueli steck of switzerland, who died from a fall during a warm-up climb. there was a continued discussion about the nature of possible changes to the hillary step. total summiters for 2017 was tallied up to be 648. 449 summited via nepal 807 climbers summited mount everest in 2018, including 563 on the nepal side and 240 from the chinese tibet side. this broke the previous record for total summits in year from which was 667 in 2013, and one factor that aided in this was an especially long and clear weather window of 11 days during the critical spring climbing season. various records were broken including a summit by a 70-year-old double-amputee hari budha magar, who undertook his climb after winning a court case in the nepali supreme court. there were no major disasters, but seven climbers died in various situations including several sherpas as well as international climbers. although record numbers of climbers reached the summit, old-time summiters that made expeditions in the 1980s lamented the crowding, feces, and cost.himalayan record keeper elizabeth hawley died in late january 2018.figures for the number of permits issued by nepal range from 347 to 375.the spring or pre-monsoon window for 2019 witnessed the deaths of a number of climbers and worldwide publication of images of hundreds of mountaineers queuing to reach the summit and sensational media reports of climbers stepping over dead bodies dismayed people around the world.there were reports of various winter expeditions in the himalayas, including k2, nanga parbat, and meru with the buzz for the everest 2019 beginning just 14 weeks to the weather window. noted climber cory richards announced on twitter that he was hoping to establish a new climbing route to the summit in 2019. also announced was an expedition to re-measure the height of everest, particularly in light of the 2015 earthquakes. china closed the base-camp to those without climbing permits in february 2019 on the northern side of mount everest. by early april, climbing teams from around the world were arriving for the 2019 spring climbing season. among the teams was a scientific expedition with a planned study of pollution, and how things like snow and vegetation influence the availability of food and water in the region. in the 2019 spring mountaineering season, there were roughly 40 teams with almost 400 climbers and several hundred guides attempting to summit on the nepali side. nepal issued 381 climbing permits for 2019. for the northern routes in chinese tibet, several hundred more permits were issued for climbing by authorities there.in may 2019, nepali mountaineering guide kami rita summited mount everest twice within a week, his 23rd and 24th ascents, making international news headlines. he first summited everest in 1994, and has summited several other extremely high mountains, such as k2 and lhotse.by 23 may 2019, about seven people had died, possibly due to crowding leading to delays high on the mountain, and shorter weather windows. one 19-year-old who summited previously noted that when the weather window opens  in chinese tibet, one austrian climber died from a fall, and by 26 may 2019 the overall number of deaths for the spring climbing season rose to 10. by 28 may, the death toll increased to 11 when a climber died at about 26,000 feet during the descent, and a 12th climber missing and presumed dead. despite the number of deaths, reports indicated that a record 891 climbers summited in the spring 2019 climbing season.although china has had various permit restrictions, and nepal requires a doctor to sign off on climbing permits, the natural dangers of climbing such as falls and avalanches combined with medical issues aggravated by everests extreme altitude led to 2019 being a year with a comparatively high death toll. in light of this, the government of nepal is now considering reviewing its existing laws on expeditions to the mountain peak.regardless of the number of permits, the weather window impacts the timing of when climbers head to the summit. the 2018 season had a similar number of climbers, but an 11-day straight calm, while in 2019 the weather windows were shorter and broken up by periods of bad weather.by 31 may 2019, the climbing season was thought to be all but concluded, as shifting weather patterns and increased wind speed make summiting more difficult. the next window is generally when the monsoon season ends in september; however, this is a less popular option as the monsoon leaves large amounts of snow on the mountain, thus increasing the danger of avalanches, which historically account for about one quarter of everest fatalities.it is the third year in this decade after 2014 and 2015 which saw no summits from the nepal a team of chinese surveyors climbed mt. everest from the north side, becoming the only climbers to summit the worlds highest peak during the coronavirus pandemic. the team was there to re-measure the height of mount everest.334 climbing permits were issued in 2014 in nepal. these were extended until 2019 due to the closure. in 2015 there were 357 permits to climb everest, but the mountain was closed again because of the avalanche and earthquake, and these permits were given a two-year extension to 2017 in 2017, a permit evader who tried to climb everest without the $11,000 permit faced, among other penalties, a $22,000 fine, bans, and a possible four years in jail after he was caught the number of permits issued each year by nepal is listed below.the chinese side in tibet is also managed with permits for summiting everest. they did not issue permits in 2008, due to the olympic torch relay being taken to the summit of mount everest.in march 2020, the governments of china and nepal announced a cancellation of all climbing permits for mount everest due to the covid-19 pandemic. in april 2020, a group of chinese mountaineers began an expedition from the chinese side. the mountain remained closed on the chinese side to all foreign climbers.mount everest has two main climbing routes, the southeast ridge from nepal and the north ridge from tibet, as well as many other less frequently climbed routes. of the two main routes, the southeast ridge is technically easier and more frequently used. it was the route used by edmund hillary and tenzing norgay in 1953 and the first recognised of 15 routes to the top by 1996. this was, however, a route decision dictated more by politics than by design, as the chinese border was closed to the western world in the 1950s, after the peoples republic of china invaded tibet.most attempts are made during may, before the summer monsoon season. as the monsoon season approaches, the jet stream shifts northward, thereby reducing the average wind speeds high on the mountain. while attempts are sometimes made in september and october, after the monsoons, when the jet stream is again temporarily pushed northward, the additional snow deposited by the monsoons and the less stable weather patterns at the monsoons tail end makes climbing extremely difficult.the ascent via the southeast ridge begins with a trek to base camp at 5,380,400 hours to walk the distance of 1.72 kilometres  achieving even this level of performance requires prolonged altitude acclimatisation, which takes 40007, the caudwell xtreme everest undertook a medical study of oxygen levels in human blood at extreme altitude. over 200 volunteers climbed to everest base camp where various medical tests were performed to examine blood oxygen levels. a small team also performed tests on the way to the summit. even at base camp, the low partial pressure of oxygen had direct effect on blood oxygen saturation levels. at sea level, blood oxygen saturation is generally 980006, about 150 bodies had never been recovered. it is not uncommon to find corpses near the standard climbing routes.debilitating symptoms consistent with high altitude cerebral oedema commonly present during descent from the summit of mount everest. profound fatigue and late times in reaching the summit are early features associated with subsequent death.a 2008 study noted that the ""death zone"" is indeed where most everest deaths occur, but also noted that most deaths occur during descent from the summit. a 2014 article in the atlantic about deaths on everest noted that while falling is one of the greatest dangers the death zone presents for all 8000ers, avalanches are a more common cause of death at lower altitudes. however, everest climbing is more deadly than base jumping, although some have combined extreme sports and everest including a russian who base-jumped off everest in a wingsuit despite this, everest is safer for climbers than a number of peaks by some measurements, but it depends on the period. some examples are kangchenjunga, k2, annapurna, nanga parbat, and the eiger  mont blanc has more deaths each year than everest, with over one hundred dying in a typical year and over eight thousand killed since records were kept. some factors that affect total mountain lethality include the level of popularity of the mountain, the skill of those climbing, and the difficulty of the climb.another health hazard is retinal haemorrhages, which can damage eyesight and cause blindness. up to a quarter of everest climbers can experience retinal haemorrhages, and although they usually heal within weeks of returning to lower altitudes, in 2010 a climber went blind and ended up dying in the death zone.at one oclock in the afternoon, the british climber peter kinloch was on the roof of the world, in bright sunlight, taking photographs of the himalayas below, ""elated, cheery and bubbly"". but mount everest is now his grave, because only minutes later, he suddenly went blind and had to be abandoned to die from the cold.the team made a huge effort for the next 12 hours to try to get him down the mountain, but to no avail, as they were unsuccessful in getting him through the difficult sections. even for the able, the everest north-east ridge is recognised as a challenge. it is hard to rescue someone who has become incapacitated and it can be beyond the ability of rescuers to save anyone in such a difficult spot. one way around this situation was pioneered by two nepali men in 2011, who had intended to paraglide off the summit. they had no choice and were forced to go through with their plan anyway, because they had run out of bottled oxygen and supplies. they successfully launched off the summit and para-glided down to namche bazaar in just 42 minutes, without having to climb down the mountain.most expeditions use oxygen masks and tanks above 8,0002 british mount everest expedition by george finch and geoffrey bruce who climbed up to 7,8004. when tenzing and hillary made the first successful summit in 1953, they also used open-circuit bottled oxygen sets, with the expeditions physiologist griffith pugh referring to the oxygen debate as a ""futile controversy"", noting that oxygen ""greatly increases subjective appreciation of the surroundings, which after all is one of the chief reasons for climbing."" for the next twenty-five years, bottled oxygen was considered standard for any successful summit....although an acclimatised lowlander can survive for a time on the summit of everest without supplemental oxygen, one is so close to the limit that even a modicum of excess exertion may impair brain function.reinhold messner was the first climber to break the bottled oxygen tradition and in 1978, with peter habeler, made the first successful climb without it. in 1980, messner summited the mountain solo, without supplemental oxygen or any porters or climbing partners, on the more difficult northwest route. once the climbing community was satisfied that the mountain could be climbed without supplemental oxygen, many purists then took the next logical step of insisting that is how it should be climbed.:154the aftermath of the 1996 disaster further intensified the debate. jon krakauers into thin air guide anatoli boukreevs decision not to use bottled oxygen was sharply criticised by jon krakauer. boukreevs supporters  krakauer and his supporters point out that, without bottled oxygen, boukreev could not directly help his clients descend. they state that boukreev said that he was going down with client martin adams, but just below the south summit, boukreev determined that adams was doing fine on the descent and so descended at a faster pace, leaving adams behind. adams states in the climb, ""for me, it was business as usual, anatolis going by, and i had no problems with that.""the low oxygen can cause a mental fog-like impairment of cognitive abilities described as ""delayed and lethargic thought process, clinically defined as bradypsychia"" even after returning to lower altitudes. in severe cases, climbers can experience hallucinations. some studies have found that high-altitude climbers, including everest climbers, experience altered brain structure. the effects of high altitude on the brain, particularly if it can cause permanent brain damage, continue to be studied.although generally less popular than spring, mount everest has also been climbed in the autumn  for example, in 2010 eric larsen and five nepali guides summited everest in the autumn for the first time in ten years. the first mainland british ascent of mount everest  the autumn season, when the monsoon ends, is regarded as more dangerous because there is typically a lot of new snow which can be unstable. however, this increased snow can make it more popular with certain winter sports like skiing and snowboarding. two japanese climbers also summited in october 1973.chris chandler and bob cormack summited everest in october 1976 as part of the american bicentennial everest expedition that year, the first americans to make an autumn ascent of mount everest according to the los angeles times. by the 21st century, summer and autumn can be more popular with skiing and snowboard attempts on mount everest. during the 1980s, climbing in autumn was actually more popular than in spring. u.s. astronaut karl gordon henize died in october 1993 on an autumn expedition, conducting an experiment on radiation. the amount of background radiation increases with higher altitudes.the mountain has also been climbed in the winter, but that is not popular because of the combination of cold high winds and shorter days. by january the peak is typically battered by 170010 climbing season, there had been 5,104 ascents to the summit by about 3,142 individuals. some notable ""firsts"" by climbers include:summiting everest with disabilities such as amputations and diseases has become popular in the 21st century, with stories like that of sudarshan gautam, a man with no arms who made it to the top in 2013. a teenager with downs syndrome made it to base camp, which has become a substitute for more extreme record-breaking because it carries many of the same thrills including the trip to the himalayas and rustic scenery. danger lurks even at base camp though, which was the site where dozens were killed in the 2015 mount everest avalanches. others that have climbed everest with amputations include mark inglis on 26 september 1988, having climbed the mountain via the south-east ridge, jean-marc boivin made the first paraglider descent of everest, in the process creating the record for the fastest descent of the mountain and the highest paraglider flight. boivin said: ""i was tired when i reached the top because i had broken much of the trail, and to run at this altitude was quite hard."" boivin ran 18.6005, pilot didier delsalle of france landed a eurocopter as350 b3 helicopter on the summit of mount everest. he needed to land for two minutes to set the f011 two nepali paraglided from the everest summit to namche bazaar in 42 minutes. they had run out of oxygen and supplies, so it was a very fast way off the mountain. the duo won national geographic adventurers of the year for 2012 for their exploits. after the paraglide they kayaked to the indian ocean, and they had made it to the bay of bengal by the end of june 2011. one had never climbed, and one had never para-glided, but together they accomplished a ground-breaking feat. by 2013 footage of the flight was shown on the television news program nightline.in 2014, a team financed and led by mountaineer wang jing used a helicopter to fly from south base camp to camp 2 to avoid the khumbu icefall, and thence climbed to the everest summit. this climb immediately sparked outrage and controversy in much of the mountaineering world over the legitimacy and propriety of her climb. nepal ended up investigating wang, who initially denied the claim that she had flown to camp 2, admitting only that some support crew were flown to that higher camp, over the khumbu icefall. in august 2014, however, she stated that she had flown to camp 2 because the icefall was impassable. ""if you dont fly to camp ii, you just go home,"" she said in an interview. in that same interview she also insisted that she had never tried to hide this fact.her team had had to use the south side because the chinese had denied them a permit to climb. ultimately, the chinese refusal may have been beneficial to nepals interests, allowing the government to showcase improved local hospitals and provided the opportunity for a new hybrid aviation/mountaineering style, triggering discussions about helicopter use in the mountaineering world. national geographic noted that a village festooned wang with honours after she donated us$30,000 to the towns hospital. wang won the international mountaineer of the year award from the nepal government in june 2014.in 2016 the increased use of helicopters was noted for increased efficiency and for hauling material over the deadly khumbu icefall. in particular it was noted that flights saved icefall porters 80 trips but still increased commercial activity at everest. after many nepalis died in the icefall in 2014, the government had wanted helicopters to handle more transportation to camp 1 but this was not possible because of the 2015 deaths and earthquake closing the mountain, so this was then implemented in 2016  that summer bell tested the 412epi, which conducted a series of tests including hovering at 18,000 feet and flying as high as 20,000 feet altitude near mount everest.climbing mount everest can be a relatively expensive undertaking for climbers.climbing gear required to reach the summit may cost in excess of us$8,000, and most climbers also use bottled oxygen, which adds around us$3,000. the permit to enter the everest area from the south via nepal costs us$10,000 to us$25,000 per person, depending on the size of the team. the ascent typically starts at one of the two base camps near the mountain, both of which are approximately 100 kilometres going with a ""celebrity guide"", usually a well-known mountaineer typically with decades of climbing experience and perhaps several everest summits, can cost over 015. on the other hand, a limited support service, offering only some meals at base camp and bureaucratic overhead like a permit, can cost as little as us$7,000 as of 2007. there are issues with the management of guiding firms in nepal, and one canadian woman was left begging for help when her guide firm, which she had paid perhaps us$40,000 to, couldnt stop her from dying in 2012. she ran out of bottled oxygen after climbing for 27 hours straight. despite decades of concern over inexperienced climbers, neither she nor the guide firm had summited everest before. the tibetan/chinese side has been described as ""out of control"" due to reports of thefts and threats. by 2015, nepal was considering to require that climbers have some experience and wanted to make the mountain safer, and especially increase revenue. one barrier to this is that low-budget firms make money not taking inexperienced climbers to the summit. those turned away by western firms can often find another firm willing to take them for a price4,42by 2016, most guiding services cost between us$35,00000,000. however, the services offered vary widely and it is ""buyer beware"" when doing deals in nepal, one of the poorest and least developed countries in the world. tourism is about four percent of nepals economy, but everest is special in that an everest porter can make nearly double the nationss average wage in a region in which other sources of income are lacking.beyond this point, costs may vary widely. it is technically possible to reach the summit with minimal additional expenses, and there are ""budget"" travel agencies which offer logistical support for such trips. however, this is considered difficult and dangerous  medical assistance while on the mountain, an experienced mountaineer guide, and even personal porters to carry ones backpack and cook ones meals. the cost of such a guide service may range from us$40,000003 interview that his late father would have been shocked to discover that rich thrill-seekers with no climbing experience were now routinely reaching the summit, ""you still have to climb this mountain yourself with your feet. but the spirit of adventure is not there any more. it is lost. there are people going up there who have no idea how to put on crampons. they are climbing because they have paid someone $65,000. it is very selfish. it endangers the lives of others.""reinhold messner concurred in 2004, ""you could die in each climb and that meant you were responsible for yourself. we were real mountaineers: careful, aware and even afraid. by climbing mountains we were not learning how big we were. we were finding out how breakable, how weak and how full of fear we are. you can only get this if you expose yourself to high danger. i have always said that a mountain without danger is not a mountain....high altitude alpinism has become tourism and show. these commercial trips to everest, they are still dangerous. but the guides and organisers tell clients, dont worry, its all organised. the route is prepared by hundreds of sherpas. extra oxygen is available in all camps, right up to the summit. people will cook for you and lay out your beds. clients feel safe and dont care about the risks.""however, not all opinions on the subject among prominent mountaineers are strictly negative. for example, edmund hillary, who went on record saying that he has not liked ""the commercialisation of mountaineering, particularly of

pleased by the changes brought to everest area by westerners, ""i dont have any regrets because i worked very hard indeed to improve the condition for the local people. when we first went in there they didnt have any schools, they didnt have any medical facilities, all over the years we have established 27 schools, we have two hospitals and a dozen medical clinics and then weve built bridges over wild mountain rivers and put in fresh water pipelines so in cooperation with the sherpas weve done a lot to benefit them.""one of the early guided summiters, richard bass  or aconcagua  and think, heck, i feel great up here, im going to try everest. but its not like that.""some climbers have reported life-threatening thefts from supply caches. vitor negrete, the first brazilian to climb everest without oxygen and part of david sharps party, died during his descent, and theft of gear and food from his high-altitude camp may have contributed.""several members were bullied, gear was stolen, and threats were made against me and my climbing partner, michael kodas, making an already stressful situation even more dire"", said one climber.in addition to theft, michael kodas describes in his book, high crimes: the fate of everest in an age of greed  unethical guides and sherpas, prostitution and gambling at the tibet base camp, fraud related to the sale of oxygen bottles, and climbers collecting donations under the pretense of removing trash from the mountain.the chinese side of everest in tibet was described as ""out of control"" after one canadian had all his gear stolen and was abandoned by his sherpa. another sherpa helped the victim get off the mountain safely and gave him some spare gear. other climbers have also reported missing oxygen bottles, which can be worth hundreds of dollars each. hundreds of climbers pass by peoples tents, making it hard to safeguard against theft. in the late 2010s, the reports of theft of oxygen bottles from camps became more common.on 18 april 2014, in one of the worst disasters to ever hit the everest climbing community up to that time, 16 sherpas died in nepal due to the avalanche that swept them off mount everest. in response to the tragedy numerous sherpa climbing guides walked off the job and most climbing companies pulled out in respect for the sherpa people mourning the loss. some still wanted to climb but there was too much controversy to continue that year. one of the issues that triggered the work action by sherpas was unreasonable client demands during climbs.mount everest has been host to other winter sports and adventuring besides mountaineering, including snowboarding, skiing, paragliding, and base jumping.yuichiro miura became the first man to ski down everest in the 1970s. he descended nearly 4,200 vertical feet from the south col before falling with extreme injuries. stefan gatt and marco siffredi snowboarded mount everest in 2001. other everest skiers include davo karni000, hans kammerlander of italy in 1996 on the north side, and kit deslauriers of the united states in 2006. in 2006 swede tomas olsson and norwegian tormod granheim skied together down the north face. olssons anchor broke while they were rappelling down a cliff in the norton couloir at about 8,500 metres, resulting in his death from a two and a half-kilometre fall. granheim skied down to camp iii. also, marco siffredi died in 2002 on his second snow-boarding expedition.various types of gliding descents have slowly become more popular, and are noted for their rapid descents to lower camps. in 1986 steve mckinney led an expedition to mount everest, during which he became the first person to fly a hang-glider off the mountain. frenchman jean-marc boivin made the first paraglider descent of everest in september 1988, descending in minutes from the south-east ridge to a lower camp. in 2011, two nepalis made a gliding descent from the everest summit down 5,000 metres  on 5 may 2013, the beverage company red bull sponsored valery rozov, who successfully base jumped off of the mountain while wearing a wingsuit, setting a record for worlds highest base jump in the process.the southern part of mount everest is regarded as one of several ""hidden valleys"" of refuge designated by padmasambhava, a ninth-century ""lotus-born"" buddhist saint.near the base of the north side of everest lies rongbuk monastery, which has been called the ""sacred threshold to mount everest, with the most dramatic views of the world."" for sherpas living on the slopes of everest in the khumbu region of nepal, rongbuk monastery is an important pilgrimage site, accessed in a few days of travel across the himalayas through nangpa la.miyolangsangma, a tibetan buddhist ""goddess of inexhaustible giving"", is believed to have lived at the top of mt everest. according to sherpa buddhist monks, mt everest is miyolangsangmas palace and playground, and all climbers are only partially welcome guests, having arrived without invitation.the sherpa people also believe that mount everest and its flanks are blessed with spiritual energy, and one should show reverence when passing through this sacred landscape. here, the karmic effects of ones actions are magnified, and impure thoughts are best avoided.in 2015 the president of the nepal mountaineering association warned that pollution, especially human waste, has reached critical levels. as much as ""26,500 pounds of human excrement"" each season is left behind on the mountain. human waste is strewn across the verges of the route to the summit, making the four sleeping areas on the route up everests south side minefields of human excrement. climbers above base camp-year history of climbing on the mountain019, due to the mounting waste problem, china closed the base camp on its side of everest to visitors without climbing permits. tourists are allowed to go as far as the rongbuk monastery.in april 2019, the solukhumbu

the world are near mount everest. on the southwest side, a major feature in the lower areas is the khumbu icefall and glacier, an obstacle to climbers on those routes but also to the base camps.",1,0
"pizza , neapolitan:009, upon italys request, neapolitan pizza was registered with the european union as a traditional speciality guaranteed dish, and in 2017 the art of its making was included on unescos list of intangible cultural heritage.the word ""pizza"" first appeared in a latin text from the central italian town of gaeta, then still part of the byzantine empire, in 997 ad; the text states that a tenant of certain property is to give the bishop of gaeta duodecim pizze suggested etymologies include:foods similar to pizza have been made since the neolithic age. records of people adding other ingredients to bread to make it more flavorful can be found throughout ancient history. in the 6th century bc, the persian soldiers of achaemenid empire during the rule king darius i baked flatbreads with cheese and dates on top of their battle shields and the ancient greeks supplemented their bread with oils, herbs, and cheese. an early reference to a pizza-like food occurs in the aeneid, when celaeno, queen of the harpies, foretells that the trojans would not find peace until they are forced by hunger to eat their tables modern pizza evolved from similar flatbread dishes in naples, italy, in the 18th or early 19th century. prior to that time, flatbread was often topped with ingredients such as garlic, salt, lard, and cheese. it is uncertain when tomatoes were first added and there are many conflicting claims. until about 1830, pizza was sold from open-air stands and out of pizza bakeries.a popular contemporary legend holds that the archetypal pizza, pizza margherita, was invented in 1889, when the royal palace of capodimonte commissioned the neapolitan pizzaiolo  although later research cast doubt on this legend. an official letter of recognition from the queens ""head of service"" remains on display in espositos shop, now called the pizzeria brandi.pizza was brought to the united states with italian immigrants in the late nineteenth century and first appeared in areas where italian immigrants concentrated. the countrys first pizzeria, lombardis, opened in 1905. following world war ii, veterans returning from the italian campaign, who were introduced to italys native cuisine, proved a ready market for pizza in particular.pizza is sold fresh or frozen, and whole or as portion-size slices or pieces. methods have been developed to overcome challenges such as preventing the sauce from combining with the dough and producing a crust that can be frozen and reheated without becoming rigid. there are frozen pizzas with raw ingredients and self-rising crusts.another form of uncooked pizza is available from take and bake pizzerias. this pizza is assembled in the store, then sold to customers to bake in their own ovens. some grocery stores sell fresh dough along with sauce and basic ingredients, to complete at home before baking in an oven.a wrapped, mass-produced frozen pizza to be cooked at homepizza dough being kneaded. after this, it is typically left undisturbed and allowed time to proof.traditional pizza dough being tossedvarious toppings being placed on pan pizzasan uncooked neapolitan pizza on a metal peel, ready for the ovenin restaurants, pizza can be baked in an oven with stone bricks above the heat source, an electric deck oven, a conveyor belt oven, or, in the case of more expensive restaurants, a wood or coal-fired brick oven. on deck ovens, pizza can be slid into the oven on a long paddle, called a peel, and baked directly on the hot bricks or baked on a screen  when made at home, it can be baked on a pizza stone in a regular oven to reproduce the effect of a brick oven. cooking directly in a metal oven results in too rapid heat transfer to the crust, burning it.  aficionado home-chefs sometimes use a specialty wood-fired pizza oven, usually installed outdoors. dome-shaped pizza ovens have been used for centuries, which is one way to achieve true heat distribution in a wood-fired pizza oven. another option is grilled pizza, in which the crust is baked directly on a barbecue grill. greek pizza, like chicago-style pizza, is baked in a pan rather than directly on the bricks of the pizza oven.when it comes to preparation, the dough and ingredients can be combined on any kind of table. with mass production of pizza, the process can be completely automated. most restaurants still use standard and purpose-built pizza preparation tables. pizzerias nowadays can even opt for hi tech pizza preparation tables that combine mass production elements with traditional techniques.pizzas baking in a traditional wood-fired brick ovena pizza baked in a wood-fired oven, being removed with a wooden peela cooked pizza served at a new york pizzeriathe bottom of the pizza, called the ""crust"", may vary widely according to style, thin as in a typical hand-tossed neapolitan pizza or thick as in a deep-dish chicago-style. it is traditionally plain, but may also be seasoned with garlic or herbs, or stuffed with cheese. the outer edge of the pizza is sometimes referred to as the cornicione. pizza dough often contains sugar, both to help its yeast rise and enhance browning of the crust.dipping sauce specifically for pizza was invented by american pizza chain papa johns pizza in 1984 and has since become popular when eating pizza, especially the crust.mozzarella is commonly used on pizza, with the highest quality buffalo mozzarella produced in the surroundings of naples. eventually, other cheeses were used well as pizza ingredients, particularly italian cheeses including provolone, pecorino romano, ricotta, and scamorza. less expensive processed cheeses or cheese analogues have been developed for mass-market pizzas to produce desirable qualities like browning, melting, stretchiness, consistent fat and moisture content, and stable shelf life. this quest to create the ideal and economical pizza cheese has involved many studies and experiments analyzing the impact of vegetable oil, manufacturing and culture processes, denatured whey proteins, and other changes in manufacture. in 1997, it was estimated that annual production of pizza cheese was 10th century, including buffalo, california, chicago, detroit, greek, new haven, new york, and st. louis styles. these regional variations include deep-dish, stuffed, pockets, turnovers, rolled, and pizza-on-a-stick, each with seemingly limitless combinations of sauce and toppings.another variation is grilled pizza, created by taking a fairly thin, round  toppings may be sliced thin to ensure that they heat through, and chunkier toppings such as sausage or peppers may be precooked before being placed on the pizza. garlic, herbs, or other ingredients are sometimes added to the pizza or the crust to maximize the flavor of the dish.grilled pizza was offered in the united states at the al forno restaurant in providence, rhode island by owners johanne killeen and george germon in 1980. although it was inspired by a misunderstanding that confused a wood-fired brick oven with a grill, grilled pizza did exist prior to 1980, both in italy, and in argentina where it is known as pizza a la parrilla. it has become a popular cookout dish, and there are even some pizza restaurants that specialize in the style. the traditional style of grilled pizza employed at al forno restaurant uses a dough coated with olive oil, strained tomato sauce, thin slices of fresh mozzarella, and a garnish made from shaved scallions, and is served uncut. the final product can be likened to flatbread with pizza toppings. another providence establishment, bob & timmys grilled pizza, was featured in a providence-themed episode of the travel channels man v. food nation in 2011.argentina, and more specifically buenos aires, received a massive italian immigration at the turn of the 19th century. immigrants from naples and genoa opened the first pizza bars, though over time spanish residents came to own the majority of the pizza businesses.standard argentine pizza has a thicker crust, called ""media masa""  other popular varieties include jam, tomato slices, red pepper and longaniza. two argentine-born varieties of pizza with onion, are also very popular: fugazza with cheese and fugazzetta. the former one consists in a regular pizza crust topped with cheese and onions; the later has the cheese between two pizza crusts, with onions on top.the worlds largest pizza was prepared in rome in december 2012, and measured 1,261 square meters  the worlds longest pizza was made infontana,

or siren as shes known in greek mythology."" the logo has been significantly streamlined over the years. in the first version, the starbucks siren was topless and had a fully visible double fish tail. the image also had a rough visual texture and has been likened to a melusine. the image is said by starbucks to be based on a 16th-century ""norse"" woodcut, although other scholars note that it is apparently based on a 15th-century woodcut in j.e. cirlots dictionary of symbols. in the second version, which was used from 1987 to 1992, her breasts were covered by her flowing hair, but her navel was still visible. the fish tail was cropped slightly, and the primary color was changed from brown to green, a nod to the alma mater of the three founders, the university of san francisco. in the third version, used between 1992 and 2011, her navel and breasts are not visible at all, and only vestiges remain of the fish tails. the original ""woodcut"" logo has been moved to the starbuckss headquarters in seattle.at the beginning of september 2006 and then again in early 2008, starbucks temporarily reintroduced its original brown logo on paper hot-drink cups. starbucks has stated that this was done to show the companys heritage from the pacific northwest and to celebrate 35 years of business. the vintage logo sparked some controversy due in part to the sirens bare breasts, but the temporary switch garnered little attention from the media. starbucks had drawn similar criticism when they reintroduced the vintage logo in 2006. the logo was altered when starbucks entered the saudi arabian market in 2000 to remove the siren, leaving only her crown, as reported in a pulitzer prize-winning column by colbert i. king in the washington post in 2002. the company announced three months later that it would be using the international logo in saudi arabia. in january 2011, starbucks announced that they would make small changes to the companys logo, removing the starbucks wordmark

program morning joe has been presented as ""brewed by starbucks"" and the shows logo changed to include the company logo. although the hosts have previously consumed starbucks coffee on air ""for free"" in the words of msnbc president phil griffin, it was not paid placement at that time. the move was met with mixed reactions from rival news organizations, viewed as both a clever partnership in an economic downturn and a compromise of journalistic standards. starbucks and kraft foods entered into a partnership in 1998 to sell starbucks products in the mondelez grocery stores owned by the latter. starbucks claimed that kraft did not sufficiently promote its products and offered kraft us$750 million to terminate the agreement; however, kraft declined the offer, but starbucks proceeded with the termination anyway. starbucks wanted to terminate the agreement because at the time, single coffee packs were beginning to become popular. in their agreement, starbucks was confined to selling packs that only worked in krafts tassimo machines. starbucks didnt want to fall behind in the market opportunities for k cups. in mid-november 2013, an arbitrator ordered starbucks to pay a

infringing its intellectual property. in 2000, san francisco cartoonist kieron dwyer was sued by starbucks for copyright and trademark infringement after creating a parody of its siren logo and putting it on the cover of one of his comics, later placing it on coffee mugs, t-shirts, and stickers that he sold on his website and at comic book conventions. dwyer felt that since his work was a parody it was protected by his right to free speech under u.s. law. the case was eventually settled out of court, as dwyer claimed he did not have the financial ability to endure a trial case with starbucks. the judge agreed that dwyers work was a parody and thus enjoyed constitutional protection; however, he was forbidden from financially ""profiting"" from using a ""confusingly similar"" image of the starbucks siren logo. dwyer was allowed to display the image as an expression of free speech, but he can no longer sell it. in a similar case, a new york store selling stickers and t-shirts using the starbucks logo with the phrase ""fuck off"" was sued by the company in 1999. an anti-starbucks website, starbuckscoffee.co.uk, which encouraged people to deface the starbucks logo was transferred to starbucks in 2005, but has since resurfaced at www.starbuckscoffee.org.uk. christian bookstores and websites in the us are selling a t-shirt featuring a logo with the siren replaced by jesus and the words ""sacrificed for me"" around the edge.other successful cases filed by starbucks include the case won in 2006 against the chain xingbake in shanghai, china for trademark infringement, because the chain used a green-and-white circular logo with a name that sounded phonetically similar to the chinese for starbucks. starbucks did not open any stores after first registering its trademark in russia in 1997, and in 2002 a russian lawyer successfully filed a request to cancel the trademark. he then registered the name with a moscow company and asked for $600,000

store was owned by a group of young haida men, who claimed that the name was a coincidence, due to ""buck"" being a haida word for ""young man""  in the 2004 dreamworks animation film shrek 2, starbucks is parodied as farbucks in the kingdom of far far away, which in turn, is a parody of a medieval version of hollywood, california.sam buck lundberg, who owns a coffee store in oregon, was prohibited from using ""sambucks coffee"" on the shop front in 2006. starbucks lost a trademark infringement case against a smaller coffee vendor in south korea that operates coffee stations under the name starpreya. the company, elpreya, says starpreya is named after the norse goddess, freja, with the letters of that name changed to ease pronunciation by koreans. the court rejected starbuckss claim that the logo of starpreya is too similar to their own logo. a bar owner in galveston, texas, usa won the right to sell ""star bock beer"" after a lawsuit by starbucks in 2003 after he registered the name, but the 2005 federal court ruling also stated that the sale of the beer must be restricted to galveston, a ruling upheld by the supreme court in 2007.ongoing cases include a dispute over the copyright application for seattles rat city rollergirls logo in 2008. the company claimed the roller derby leagues logo by a washington artist was too similar to its own. starbucks requested an extension to further examine the issue and possibly issue a complaint, which was granted by the trademark office. the july 16, 2008, deadline passed without action by the corporation. starbucks launched action against an indian cosmetics business run by shahnaz husain, after she applied to register the name starstruck for coffee and related products. she said she aimed to open a chain of stores that would sell coffee and chocolate-based cosmetics. a cafe in al-manara square, ramallah, palestinian territories, opened in 2009 with the name ""stars and bucks"" and a logo using a similar green circle and block lettering. like starbucks, the stars and bucks serves cappuccinos in ceramic cups, and offers free wifi. according to speculation cited in the seattle post intelligencer, the cafes name and imitation starbucks style may be a political satire of american consumerism. starbucks is not known to have taken action against this business.in 2014, nathan fielder, a canadian comedian behind the hit show nathan for you, opened a store called ""dumb starbucks coffee"" in los feliz, los angeles ca. the store resembled a typical starbucks with one exception: everything was preceded by the word ""dumb."" for example, the drinks he carried included dumb skinny vanilla lattes and dumb frapuccinos. the store carried music titled ""dumb jazz standards"" and ""dumb norah jones duets."" he thought he could bypass infringement and copyright claims through the ""parody law,"" referring to the parody aspect of fair use laws  others have used

dipper wells were replaced with push button metered faucets for rinsing. this will reportedly save up to 150006005 for the initiative. in a 2008 media article, starbuckss vice president of corporate social responsibility acknowledged that the company continued to struggle with environmental responsibility, as none of its cups were recyclable and stores did not have recycling bins. at the time that the article was published, starbucks gave customers who brought in their own reusable cup a 10-cent discount, in addition to using corrugated cup sleeves made from 85 percent post-consumer recycled fiber, which is 34 percent less paper than the original. during the same period, starbucks entered into a partnership with conservation international49 indicators. farmers who earn high

average $1.42 per pound after a long-running dispute between starbucks and ethiopia, starbucks agreed to support and promote ethiopian coffees. an article in bbc news, states that ethiopian ownership of popular coffee designations such as harrar and sidamo is acknowledged, even if they are not registered. ethiopia fought hard for this acknowledgement mainly to help give its poverty-stricken farmers a chance to make more money. in 2006, starbucks said it paid $1.42 per pound for its coffee. the coffee starbucks bought for $1.42 per pound, had a selling price013, the starbucks website

"transport a mode of transport is a solution that makes use of a particular type of vehicle, infrastructure, and operation. the transport of a person or of cargo may involve one mode or several of the modes, with the latter case being called intermodal or multimodal transport. each mode has its own advantages and disadvantages, and will be chosen on the basis of cost, capability, and route.human-powered transport, a form of sustainable transport, is the transport of people and/or goods using human muscle-power, in the form of walking, running and swimming. modern technology has allowed machines to enhance human power. human-powered transport remains popular for reasons of cost-saving, leisure, physical exercise, and environmentalism; it is sometimes the only type available, especially in underdeveloped or inaccessible regions.although humans are able to walk without infrastructure, the transport can be enhanced through the use of roads, especially when using the human power with vehicles, such as bicycles and inline skates. human-powered vehicles have also been developed for difficult environments, such as snow and water, by watercraft rowing and skiing; even the air can be entered with human-powered aircraft.animal-powered transport is the use of working animals for the movement of people and commodities. humans may ride some of the animals directly, use them as pack animals for carrying goods, or harness them, alone or in teams, to pull sleds or wheeled vehicles.a fixed-wing aircraft, commonly called airplane, is a heavier-than-air craft where movement of the air in relation to the wings is used to generate lift. the term is used to distinguish this from rotary-wing aircraft, where the movement of the lift surfaces relative to the air generates lift. a gyroplane is both fixed-wing and rotary wing. fixed-wing aircraft range from small trainers and recreational aircraft to large airliners and military cargo aircraft.two things necessary for aircraft are air flow over the wings for lift and an area for landing. the majority of aircraft also need an airport with the infrastructure to receive maintenance, restocking, refueling and for the loading and unloading of crew, cargo, and passengers. while the vast majority of aircraft land and take off on land, some are capable of take-off and landing on ice, snow, and calm water.the aircraft is the second fastest method of transport, after the rocket. commercial jets can reach up to 955 kilometres per hour  as of april 28, 2009, the guardian article notes that ""the who estimates that up to 500,000 people are on planes at any time.""land transport covers all land-based transport systems that provide for the movement of people, goods and services. land transport plays a vital role in linking communities to each other. land transport is a key factor in urban planning. it consists of 2 kinds, rail and road.rail transport is where a train runs along a set of two parallel steel rails, known as a railway or railroad. the rails are anchored perpendicular to ties  modern high-speed rail is capable of speeds up to 350010, there were 1.015 billion automobiles worldwide.road transport offers a complete freedom to road users to transfer the vehicle from one lane to the other and from one road to another according to the need and convenience. this flexibility of changes in location, direction, speed, and timings of travel is not available to other modes of transport. it is possible to provide door to door service only by road transport.automobiles provide high flexibility with low capacity, but require high energy and area use, and are the main source of harmful noise and air pollution in cities; buses allow for more efficient travel at the cost of reduced flexibility. road transport by truck is often the initial and final stage of freight transport.water transport is movement by means of a watercraft050 this number is expected to rise to 68%. public transport policy must evolve to meet the changing priorities of the urban world. the institution of policy enforces order in transport, which is by nature chaotic as people attempt to travel from one place to another as fast as possible. this policy helps to reduce accidents and save lives.relocation of travelers and cargo are the most common uses of transport. however, other uses exist, such as the strategic and tactical relocation of armed forces during warfare, or the civilian mobility construction or emergency equipment.passenger transport, or travel, is divided into public and private transport. public transport is scheduled services on fixed routes, while private is vehicles that provide ad hoc services at the riders desire. the latter offers better flexibility, but has lower capacity, and a higher environmental impact. travel may be as part of daily commuting, for business, leisure or migration.short-haul transport is dominated by the automobile and mass transit. the latter consists of buses in rural and small cities, supplemented with commuter rail, trams and rapid transit in larger cities. long-haul transport involves the use of the automobile, trains, coaches and aircraft, the last of which have become predominantly used for the longest, including intercontinental, travel. intermodal passenger transport is where a journey is performed through the use of several modes of transport; since all human transport normally starts and ends with walking, all passenger transport can be considered intermodal. public transport may also involve the intermediate change of vehicle, within or across modes, at a transport hub, such as a bus or railway station.taxis and buses can be found on both ends of the public transport spectrum. buses are the cheapest mode of transport but are not necessarily flexible, and taxis are very flexible but more expensive. in the middle is demand-responsive transport, offering flexibility whilst remaining affordable.international travel may be restricted for some individuals due to legislation and visa requirements.an ambulance is a vehicle used to transport people from or between places of treatment, and in some instances will also provide out-of-hospital medical care to the patient. the word is often associated with road-going ""emergency ambulances"", which form part of emergency medical services, administering emergency care to those with acute medical problems.air medical services is a comprehensive term covering the use of air transport to move patients to and from healthcare facilities and accident scenes. personnel provide comprehensive prehospital and emergency and critical care to all types of patients during aeromedical evacuation or rescue operations, aboard helicopters, propeller aircraft, or jet aircraft.freight transport, or shipping, is a key in the value chain in manufacturing. with increased specialization and globalization, production is being located further away from consumption, rapidly increasing the demand for transport. transport creates place utility by moving the goods from the place of production to the place of consumption. while all modes of transport are used for cargo transport, there is high differentiation between the nature of the cargo transport, in which mode is chosen. logistics refers to the entire process of transferring products from producer to consumer, including storage, transport, transshipment, warehousing, material-handling, and packaging, with associated exchange of information. incoterm deals with the handling of payment and responsibility of risk during transport.containerization, with the standardization of iso containers on all vehicles and at all ports, has revolutionized international and domestic trade, offering a huge reduction in transshipment costs. traditionally, all cargo had to be manually loaded and unloaded into the haul of any ship or car; containerization allows for automated handling and transfer between modes, and the standardized sizes allow for gains in economy of scale in vehicle operation. this has been one of the key driving factors in international trade and globalization since the 1950s.bulk transport is common with cargo that can be handled roughly without deterioration; typical examples are ore, coal, cereals and petroleum. because of the uniformity of the product, mechanical handling can allow enormous quantities to be handled quickly and efficiently. the low value of the cargo combined with high volume also means that economies of scale become essential in transport, and gigantic ships and whole trains are commonly used to transport bulk. liquid products with sufficient volume may also be transported by pipeline.air freight has become more common for products of high value; while less than one percent of world transport by volume is by airline, it amounts to forty percent of the value. time has become especially important in regards to principles such as postponement and just-in-time within the value chain, resulting in a high willingness to pay for quick delivery of key components or items of high value-to-weight ratio. in addition to mail, common items sent by air include electronics and fashion clothing.transport is a key necessity for specialization emission, an approach that is becoming popular among cities worldwide is to prioritise public transport and cycles over cars, creating 20-minute neighbourhoods that drastically reduce travel time and levying a congestion charge in cars for travelling to already congested areas during peak time.  there are various sustainable development goals humans first means of transport involved walking, running and swimming. the domestication of animals introduced a new way to lay the burden of transport on more powerful creatures, allowing the hauling of heavier loads, or humans riding animals for greater speed and duration. inventions such as the wheel and the sled or humans carrying goods over dirt tracks that often followed game trails. many early civilizations, including those in mesopotamia and the indus valley, constructed paved roads.  in classical antiquity, the persian and roman empires built stone-paved roads to allow armies to travel quickly. deep roadbeds of crushed stone underneath kept such roads dry. the medieval caliphate later built tar-paved roads. the first watercraft were canoes cut out from tree trunks. early water transport was accomplished with ships that were either rowed or used the wind for propulsion, or a combination of the two. the importance of water has led to most cities that grew up as sites for trading being located on rivers or on the sea-shore, often at the intersection of two bodies of water. until the industrial revolution, transport remained slow and costly, and production and consumption gravitated as close to each other as feasible.the industrial revolution in the 19th century saw a number of inventions fundamentally change transport. with telegraphy, communication became instant and independent of the transport of physical objects. the invention of the steam engine, closely followed by its application in rail transport, made land transport independent of human or animal muscles. both speed and capacity increased, allowing specialization through manufacturing being located independently of natural resources. the 19th century also saw the development of the steam ship, which sped up global transport.with the development of the combustion engine and the automobile around 1900, road transport became more competitive again, and mechanical private transport originated. the first ""modern"" highways were constructed during the 19th century with macadam. later, tarmac and concrete became the dominant paving materials. in 1903 the wright brothers demonstrated the first successful controllable airplane, and after world war i after world war ii  scientific spaceflight began in the 1950s, with rapid growth until the 1970s, when interest dwindled. in the 1950s the introduction of containerization gave massive efficiency gains in freight transport, fostering globalization. international air travel became much more accessible in the 1960s with the commercialization of the jet engine. along with the growth in automobiles and motorways, rail and water transport declined in relative importance. after the introduction of the shinkansen in japan in 1964, high-speed rail in asia and europe started attracting passengers on long-haul routes away from the airlines.early in u.s. history, private joint-stock corporations owned most aqueducts, bridges, canals, railroads, roads, and tunnels. most such transport infrastructure came under government control in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, culminating in the nationalization of inter-city passenger rail-service with the establishment of amtrak. recently, however, a movement to privatize roads and other infrastructure has gained some ground and adherents.",1,0
"the german shepherd  is a breed of medium to large-sized working dog that originated in germany. according to the fci, the breeds english language name is german shepherd dog. the breed was officially known as the  ""alsatian wolf dog"" in the uk from after the first world war until 1977 when its name was changed back to german shepherd. despite its wolf-like appearance, the german shepherd is a relatively modern breed of dog, with their origin dating to 1899.as a herding dog, german shepherds are working dogs developed originally for herding sheep. since that time, however, because of their strength, intelligence, trainability, and obedience, german shepherds around the world are often the preferred breed for many types of work, including disability assistance, search-and-rescue, police and military roles and acting. the german shepherd is the second-most registered breed by the american kennel club and seventh-most registered breed by the kennel club in the united kingdom.german shepherds are medium to large-sized dogs. the breed standard height at the withers is 60. the akc official breed standard does not set a standard weight range. they have a domed forehead, a long square-cut muzzle with strong jaws and a black nose. the eyes are medium-sized and brown. the ears are large and stand erect, open at the front and parallel, but they often are pulled back during movement. a german shepherd has a long neck, which is raised when excited and lowered when moving at a fast pace as well as stalking. the tail is bushy and reaches to the hock.german shepherds have a double coat which is close and dense with a thick undercoat. the coat is accepted in two variants: medium and long. the gene for long hair is recessive, and therefore the long-haired variety is rarer. treatment of the long-haired variation differs across standards; it is accepted but does not compete against standard-coated dogs under the german and uk kennel clubs while it can compete with standard-coated dogs, but is considered a fault, in the american kennel club. the fci accepted the long-haired type in 2010, listing it as the variety b, while the short-haired type is listed as the variety a.most commonly, german shepherds are either tan/black or red/black. most color varieties have black masks and black body markings which can range from a classic ""saddle"" to an overall ""blanket"". rarer color variations include the sable, pure-black, pure-white, liver, silver, blue, and panda varieties. the all-black and sable varieties are acceptable according to most standards; however, the blue and liver are considered to be serious faults and the all-white is grounds for instant disqualification from showing in conformation at all breed and specialty shows.male

for their intelligence. in a list of breeds most likely to bark as watchdogs, stanley coren ranked the breed in second place. coupled with their strength, this trait makes the breed desirable as police, guard and search and rescue dogs, as they are able to quickly learn various tasks and interpret instructions better than other breeds.german shepherds are moderately active dogs and are described in breed standards as self assured. the breed is marked by a willingness to learn and an eagerness to have a purpose. they are curious, which makes them excellent guard dogs and suitable for search missions. they can become overprotective of their family and territory, especially if not socialized correctly. they are not inclined to become immediate friends with strangers. german shepherds are highly intelligent and obedient, as well as protective of their owners.while an australian report from 1999 provides statistics showing that german shepherds are the breed third most likely to attack a person in some australian locales, once their popularity is taken into account, the percentages of gsd attacks drops to 38th.according to the national geographic channel television show dangerous encounters, the bite of a german shepherd has a force of over 1,060 newtons the modern german shepherd breed is criticized by some for straying away from max von stephanitzs original ideology that german shepherds should be bred primarily as working dogs and that breeding should be strictly controlled to eliminate defects quickly. he believed that, above all else, german shepherds should be bred for intelligence and working ability.the kennel club, in the united kingdom, is involved in a dispute with german shepherd breed clubs about the issue of soundness in the show strain of the breed. some show strains have been bred with an extremely roached topline  the kennel club has decided to retrain judges to penalize dogs suffering these problems.the kennel club also recommends testing for haemophilia and hip dysplasia, other common problems with the breed.the east-european shepherd is a variety of the german shepherd bred in the former soviet union with the purpose of creating a larger more cold resistant version of the german shepherd; it lacks the physical deformities bred into western show lines of german shepherds and has become one of russias most popular dog types.the king shepherd is a variety of the german shepherd bred in the united states, its breeders hoping to rectify the physical deformities that have been bred into the original breed.the shiloh shepherd is a variety of the german shepherd bred in the united states. it was developed in the 1970s and 1980s to correct behavioural and conformational issues that have been bred into modern german shepherds, and was bred for large size, length of their back, temperament and soundness of hips. it has been recognized by the american rare breed association since 1990.the white shepherd is a variety of the german shepherd bred in the united states.  white coated german shepherds were once banned from registration in their native germany, but in the united states and canada the colouration gained a following and a breed club was formed specifically for white coloured german shepherds, calling their variety the white shepherd. the variety is recognized as a separate breed by the united kennel club.the white swiss shepherd dog german shepherds are a popular selection for use as working dogs. they are known for being easy to train and good for performing tasks and following instructions. they are especially well known for their police work, being used for tracking criminals, patrolling troubled areas and detection and holding of suspects. additionally, thousands of german shepherds have been used by the military. usually trained for scout duty, they are used to warn soldiers to the presence of enemies or of booby traps or other hazards. german shepherds have also been trained by military groups to parachute from aircraft or as anti-tank weapons. they were used in world war ii as messenger dogs, rescue dogs and personal guard dogs. a number of these dogs were taken home by foreign servicemen, who were impressed by their intelligence.the german shepherd is one of the most widely used breeds in a wide variety of scent-work roles. these include search and rescue, cadaver searching, narcotics detection, explosives detection, accelerant detection and mine detection dog, among others. they are suited for these lines of work because of their keen sense of smell and their ability to work regardless of distractions.at one time the german shepherd was the breed chosen almost exclusively to be used as a guide dog for the visually impaired. when formal guide dog training began in switzerland in the 1920s under the leadership of dorothy eustis, all of the dogs trained were german shepherd females. an experiment in temperament testing of a group of labrador retrievers and german shepherds showed that the retrievers scored higher on average in emotional stability, ability to recover promptly from frightening situations, cooperative behavior and friendliness; while the german shepherds were superior in aggression and defensive behavior. these results suggested that labrador retrievers were more suited to guide dog work while german shepherds were more suited to police work.currently, labradors and golden retrievers are more widely used for this work, although there are still german shepherds being trained. in 2013, about 15% of the dogs trained by guide dogs of america are german shepherds, while the remainder are labrador retrievers and golden retrievers. the guide dogs for the blind association in the united kingdom trains some german shepherds, while the comparable organization in the us only trains labrador retrievers, golden retrievers and crosses between these breeds.german shepherds are still used for herding and tending sheep grazing in meadows next to gardens and crop fields. they are expected to patrol the boundaries to keep sheep from trespassing and damaging the crops. in germany and other places these skills are tested in utility dog trials also known as herdengebrauchshund one mexican german shepherd, zuyaqui, was dissected and his body put on display at the sedenas ""narco museum"" in mexico. he is regarded to be the dog who has captured the most drugs in mexican police and military history.a german night-watchman from 1950 with his german shepherdswedish german shepherds during

1859, a broadly distributed european herding dog, the french berger picard, had given rise to the german shepherd dog and the five italian herding breeds: the bergamasco shepherd, cane paratore, lupino del gigante, pastore doropa, and the pastore della lessinia e del lagorai.during the 1850s, attempts were being made to standardize dog breeds. dogs were being bred to preserve traits that assisted in their job of herding sheep and protecting their flocks from predators. in germany this was practiced within local communities, where shepherds selected and bred dogs. it was recognized that the breed had the necessary skills for herding sheep, such as intelligence, speed, strength and keen senses of smell. the results were dogs that were able to do such things, but that differed significantly, both in appearance and ability, from one locality to another.to combat these differences, the phylax society was formed in 1891 with the intention of creating standardised development plans for native dog breeds in germany. the society disbanded after only three years due to ongoing internal conflicts regarding the traits in dogs that the society should promote; some members believed dogs should be bred solely for working purposes, while others believed dogs should be bred also for appearance. while unsuccessful in their goal, the phylax society had inspired people to pursue standardising dog breeds independently.with the rise of large, industrialized cities in germany, the predator population began to decline, rendering sheepdogs unnecessary. at the same time, the awareness of sheepdogs as a versatile, intelligent class of canine began to rise. max von stephanitz, an ex-cavalry captain and former student of the berlin veterinary college, was an ex-member of the phylax society who firmly believed dogs should be bred for working. he admired the intelligence, strength and ability of germanys native sheepdogs, but could not find any one single breed that satisfied him as the perfect working dog.in 1899, von stephanitz was attending a dog show when he was shown a dog named hektor linksrhein. hektor was the product of few generations of selective breeding and completely fulfilled what von stephanitz believed a working dog should be. he was pleased with the strength of the dog and was so taken by the animals intelligence, loyalty and beauty, that he purchased him immediately. after purchasing the dog he changed his name to horand von grafrath and von stephanitz founded the verein f3, the verein f1, during his years of poverty, but he had been forced to lodge the dog elsewhere. however, she managed to escape and return to him. hitler, who adored the loyalty and obedience of the dog, thereafter developed a great liking for the breed. german shepherds were also used widely as guard dogs at nazi concentration camps during the holocaust.the breed was named deutscher sch010.when the uk kennel accepted registrations in 1919, 54 german shepherds were registered. by 1926 this number had grown to over 8,000. the breed gained international recognition after the end of world war i. returning soldiers spoke highly of the breed and animal actors rin tin tin and strongheart popularised the breed further. the first german shepherd dog registered in the united states was queen of switzerland. her offspring suffered from defects as the result of poor breeding, which caused the breed to suffer a decline in popularity during the late 1920s.popularity increased again after the german shepherd sieger pfeffer von bern became the 1937 and 1938 grand victor in american kennel club dog shows, only to suffer another decline at the conclusion of world war ii, due to anti-german sentiment. popularity increased gradually until 1993, when they became the third most popular breed in the united states. as of 2016, the german shepherd is the second most popular breed in the us. additionally, the breed is typically among the most popular in other registries. the german shepherd dogs physique is very well suited to competing in shows and competitions, such as agility trials.many common ailments of the german shepherd are a result of the inbreeding practiced early in the breeds life. one such common ailment is hip and elbow dysplasia which may cause the dog to experience pain later on in life and may cause arthritis. a study conducted by the university of zurich  found that 45% of the police working dogs were affected by degenerative spinal stenosis, although a small sample size was used. the orthopedic foundation for animals found that 19.1% of german shepherd are affected by hip dysplasia. there are, however, ways to help prevent hip dysplasia, including getting a pup from a good breeder, keeping it on a healthy diet, and limiting the amount of jumping or rough play. german shepherds have low frequency of ear infections, since this breed is well-known for hyperactivity of its cerumen-producing glands. according to a recent survey in the uk, the median life span of german shepherds is 10.95 years, which is normal for a dog of their size.degenerative myelopathy, a neurological disease, occurs with enough regularity specifically in the breed to suggest that the breed is predisposed to it. a very inexpensive dna saliva test is now available to screen for degenerative myelopathy. the test screens for the mutated gene that has been seen in dogs with degenerative myelopathy. a small study in the uk showed 16% of young asymptomatic gsds to be homozygous for the mutation, with a further 38% being carriers. now that a test is available the disease can be bred out of breeds with a high preponderance. the test is only recommended for predisposed breeds, but can be performed on dna samples from any dog, collected through swabbing the inside of the animals cheek with a sterile cotton swab. prospective german shepherd buyers can now request the test from the breeder or buy from a breeder who is known to test their dogs.additionally, german shepherds have a higher than normal incidence of von willebrand disease, a common inherited bleeding disorder, and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency  treatment is usually provided in the form of pancreatic supplements taken with food.musculoskeletal disorders are debilitating conditions that are often associated with genetic makeup, malnutrition, and stress-related events. some breeds like the german shepherd, are predisposed to a variety of different skeletal disorders, including but not limited to: canine hip dysplasia, cauda equina syndrome, and osteoarthritis. these conditions can be a result of poor breeding or induced by intense exercise and poor diet.canine hip dysplasia  german shepherds are genetically predisposed to chd and the university of veterinary medicine in germany found its prevalence estimated to be approximately 35% of veterinary cases associated with the disorder.osteoarthritis is one of the main contributors of musculoskeletal pain and disabilities that commonly affect german shepherds. mechanical stress, oxidative damage and inflammatory mediators combine to induce the gradual degeneration of the articular cartilage in the joint, resulting in reduced muscle mass, pain, and locomotion.feeding a well-balanced diet designed for large breeds like the german shepherd to ensure adequate growth rates and proper maintenance of musculoskeletal health is essential. dietary energy levels should be monitored and controlled throughout all life stages and activity levels of the german shepherd to assist in the prevention and treatment of musculoskeletal disorder symptoms. several dietary factors play a crucial role in maintaining skeletal health and are described as follows:appropriate calcium levels are vital in developing a strong skeletal system and aid in preventing orthopaedic diseases like canine hip dysplasia. furthermore, the ratio of calcium and phosphorus must be balanced and at a recommended ratio of 1.2:1 to ensure proper bone development and structure. imbalances in calcium and phosphorus levels can result in various skeletal complications. excess phosphorus can produce lesions in bones whereas excessive calcium can lead to hypocalcaemia and result in excess bone deposition, interfering with normal bone development. in extreme circumstances of insufficient calcium intake, bone resorption can occur due to the body withdrawing calcium deposits from the skeletal frame as a last resort to fulfill dietary needs.omega-3 fatty acids such as eicosapentaenoic acid  furthermore, epa and dha inhibit key regulators of the inflammatory process and suppress their activation which can help alleviate pain and reduce inflamed joints associated with many skeletal disorders. ensuring an appropriate ratio of omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acids of approximately 5:1 is very important for inflammation processes. animals source, specifically marine life such as fish, krill, and mussels, and plant sources such as flaxseed, soybean and canola oil, are particularly rich in omega-3 fatty acids.glucosamine is an amino-monosaccharide that naturally occurs in all tissues, particularly in articular cartilage of joints and from the biosynthesis of glucose. natural synthesis of glucosamine occurs in the extracellular matrix of articular cartilage in joints. however, as a result of damage to the joint or cartilage, there is decreased ability to synthesize glucosamine resulting in the deterioration of the joint, and supplementation is required. clinical trials of long term administration of glucosamine in german shepherds have reduced symptoms of degenerative joint disease and accelerated cartilage healing. anti-inflammatory effects of glucosamine are believed to contribute to the reduction of pain, promote joint recovery and mobility, and prevent further cartilage degradation. similarly, chondroitin supplementation is proposed to have comparable results in inhibiting degradative enzymes within the cartilage matrix to reduce the effects of osteoarthritis, but further research is required to assess long term benefits.vitamins such as a and d also have crucial roles in bone development and maintenance by regulating bone and calcium metabolism. adequate levels should be incorporated into a german shepherd diet to promote a healthy musculoskeletal system.german shepherds have been featured in a wide range of media.in 1921 strongheart became one of the earliest canine film stars, and was followed in 1922 by rin tin tin, who is considered the most famous german shepherd. both have stars on the hollywood walk of fame.batmans dog ace the bat-hound appeared in the batman comic books, initially in 1955, through 1964. between 1964 and 2007, his appearances were sporadic.a german shepherd named inspector rex is the star of an austrian police procedural drama program of the same name, which won many awards, where german shepherd rex assists the vienna kriminalpolizei homicide unit. the show was aired in many languages.k\xc3\xa1ntor  was also created, which was only very loosely based on the actual dogs story, setting the events more than a decade after the real k\xc3\xa1ntor died. nevertheless it became one of the staple productions of hungarian television history, making german shepherds the most popular dog breed in the country ever since.horand von grafrath born 1 january 1895, was the first german shepherd dog and the genetic basis for

" the german army defeated the austro-hungarian army on december 17, 1871. the german invasion of austria began on february 13, 1872. the austro-hungarian army under general karl von langobardt launched the first major offensive of the war in may, capturing austrian cities such as bergamo and orsvany.the german invasion of poland started on july 13, 1872, when the german army landed in lynd, a town in the lothar region of poland. a small army under major general von lunge followed shortly, and hit ludendorffsburg on july 19, forcing the surrender of poland   the allied soldiers of the empire supported the polands annexation to the empire.the defeat of the austro-hungarian army at the battle of bethoven hastened by the war. germany was left with a large territory in central europe at the end of the war, which it used to start its war against the austro-hungarian army of the east. the bethoven offensive was the most successful of the three major wars. it started the first german offensive in the west, which ended with the bethovenus defeat, on march 13, 1873.the austro-hungarian offensive in the eastern front continued for some time, and the german army of the east continually advanced in the west. at the battle of bethoven, the austro-hungarian army under von lunge defeated the austro-hungarian army under general wilson, who had been encircling grain warehouses in the west. the austro-hungarian victory in this battle was the first time the austro-hungarian army had truly crossed the frontier into europe.the austro-hungarian army of the east left the west and headed towards south africa, while the german army of the south headed towards central europe. both armies engaged in a protracted battle for territory and supplies, with the german army taking significant losses. the battle of bethoven was the first major austro-hungarian offensive in the war. it started the second german offensive in the west, which ended with the battle of elkhorn on june 7, 1872. the battle was the first major austro-hungarian offensive in the war after the battle of kur panenka in october, which also saw the german army of the east cross-over the line and head towards the lothar frontier. in the battle of bethoven, the german army broke the austro-hungarian army in their main supply route, defeated the austro-hungarian army at the battle of bethoven, and then crossed the elkhorn river into south africa.soviet forces under stalin launched an offensive that began in the spring of the following year, roughly synchronising with the german advance through the west. this was followed up by the battle of kursk, which saw the german army of the soviet east respond by encircling the soviet army of the north at kursk, thus completing the territorial gain made by the soviet armies at kursk.the war led to a large scale devastation in the soviet empire. on the eastern front, the german army of the soviet east overwhelming retained their territory in central europe, while the soviet armies of the soviets far comprised only a small proportion of german territory. in the caucasus war the soviet armies were in a superior position, having a strong foothold in the areas that germany had occupied previously. the caucasus campaign was the first major soviet military campaign in the war since world war ii.the war began as a series of raids into the caucasus region by germany, which began in the 17th century and ended in the war of the caucasus. it started with the german invasions of the soviet union in the 17th century and the caucasus campaign in the 18th century. the core issues were the frontier and the role of the soviet union as a protector of the frontier. the war of the caucasus was fought over the territory of caucasus, between the soviet union and the united states of america. the caucasus war became a major german conflict when the soviet union declared war on the united states of america on august 1, 1918, and the allied powers, working with the united states, began airdrop and drop attacks on the soviet union as well as coalition forces in the caucasus. the allied power dropped its bombing of caucasus during the caucasus campaign and stopped attacking caucasus itself in the last two years of the war. the allied powers also stopped the caucasus war in 1918 by",0,1
" of the species, the ancestors have been found to live in the tropical and subtropical regions of asia and eurasia, from the caribbean coast of south america to the pacific ocean, and from north america to india. the diet of most species consists of insects and worms, with the latter resembling the diet of the austronesian and pangolins. in western parts of asia, the staple food is the pangolin, while in china, the staple food is the python.the distribution of terrestrial vertebrates, including birds and mammals, in asia and africa is not uniform. many asian islands have largely marine habitats, while marshes are sparsely populated and the land mass is dominated by seabirds and mammals. fish are rare in south america, while the lionfth century, the number of species on earth was estimated at around 1.5 billion, with the remaining ones being ground-dwelling animals. about 700 million people live in areas which lie close to the arctic circle, and only about 60 million people live in the northern hemisphere. the number of species in north america has more than doubled since the last ice age. the continent hosts more than 100 times more species than the arctic ocean, with the continent hosting more than 100,000 species of invertebrates. asia and africa have more terrestrial species than any other continent. the number of species in the arctic is virtually unknown.the continent hosts more than 100,000 species of invertebrates. it is the second-most species rich continent, with more species per square kilometre  1.5 billion years ago, the arctic was dominated by land plants. at the same time, the oceans were filled with water. as a result, the climate changed from a wet to a cold-weather-dependent desert. this event changed the distribution of plants in the arctic and led to the radiation of plants across the region, including the partitioning of continents.at the same time, the composition of the earths atmosphere changed. it has been suggested that the melting of the glaciers of the alaskan shelf and surrounding coast caused the radiation of plants across the region.the arctic is a semi-arid continent with a milder climate and a slightly cooler temperature. the cold, 0th century, the arctic summers were much longer, milder than the summers of the northern hemisphere and experienced a temperature difference of about 30009, the minimum temperature is 29.6% lower than the minimum temperature of the previous recorded minimum. the minimum temperature is lower than all but two of the other terrestrial planets except the moon, and about 1000 times colder than the surface of the moon.the northern hemisphere summers usually have minimum temperatures in the northern and western parts of the continent average around 60005, the number of species is estimated at about zero. the southern hemisphere summers usually have maximum temperatures in the southern and eastern parts of the continent. on average, species on the southern hemisphere have a minimum temperature of about 240012 study of the fossilised remains of salamanders and salamis in the geologic field of the far north of the continent, south pole and up to about 2,500 genes, they had been replaced by modern fish about 300 million years ago, although salamanders were never fully domesticated. some genera remain near-legionary species, such as the salamander. salamanders and salamis are currently thought to have been the last truly independent species of land animals.the continents land surface is divided into two main sections, the lowland and the highland, and the two sections are linked by open water. the lowlands consist of land plants and bottomland plants, in turn called gravel. the highlands consist of marine plants, algae and other organic compounds, mostly in the form of organic carbon. the marine plants make up the land plants and algae that make up the strongest part of the land surface and provide the main drainage means for the continent. the continents land surface is divided into three main sections, the lithosphere and the orogeny. on the coasts of the continents, sea levels rise, while on the land, they drop. on the continents, the oceans absorb more of the water that falls as rain whereas the land conversely absorbs more water from the oceans than the oceans do; thus the land is being forced to hold more water than it is being forced to do. the lithosphere is mainly made of calcium carbonate, oxygen isotope ratios and chemical composition. the orogeny is partly made of iron and silicon isotope ratios and chemical composition. the lithosphere is also partly made of carbonate, oxygen and silicon isotope ratios and chemical composition. the ocean floor is mainly made of plankton. plankton are the single most common type of organism on the planet, accounting for about half of the worlds biomass. the oceans primary productivity, or biomass, is the flux of dissolved plant life. about half of the plankton",0,1

""reverence"" is one of the core aspects of good manners, which are core Christian teaching, as the act of deference to others is seen as a form of humility. in the act of deference to others, the passive voice is encouraged and the passive-aggressive tone is avoided.in the new testament, the act of deference to authority figures is praised in parables, such as the parable of the poor and the parable of the malarkey. the act of deference is termed ""standing for the little man"", and the act of deference is praised in the gospel of john. it is also written that ""he who has the little in himself will be taken in to the kingdom of heaven"".the word ""revelation""  was introduced into english in the late 19th century  its etymology is unknown, but the word is associated with a significant number of ancient greek roots, and it is the same word used in the quran.the word ""reverence"" is also used in the spiritual life of the ancients, such as in the quran and the hadiths.the word ""reverence"" was used by the ancient chinese as a religious and secular term, and it is also used by the chinese as a term of endearment.the word ""reverence"" was used by the romans of the late middle ages as an adornment of the body of a dead loved one, and it is also used by the romans of the late middle ages as a term of endearment. the word has been in use since the late middle ages.the word ""reverence"" first appears in the 15th-century english poem la nozze di pisa  in the 17th century, the english author henry shakespeare included a passage in his play john brown, in which jay, a young raven, is shown standing by a tree in the shape of a ""kingly""  the name derives from the greek   by the 17th century, the word had acquired a second meaning, ""of the king"", derived from   three ancient translations of the word are extant: in 1598, the french writer sir joseph brillon translates ""king"" in the plural as ""quear"" in his work le grande dame de sang. in 1672, the english writer sir john redmond transliterates ""queer"" as ""quear"" in his translation of paul vaz, the 16th-century english theologian and missionary to france. in the 17th century, the swedish theologian john calvin defines the word as ""queer"", a word which is ""originally a corruption of rand"".the word ""reverence""  this has caused some confusion concerning the relationship between ""reverence"" and ""reverence"", as some people may mean ""reverence"" and ""reverence"", while others may use the word simply to refer to a particular behaviour. ""reverence"" is not a legal term, and does not occur in the vernacular in the english language. however, it is sometimes used in legal contexts, such as in the context of authorisations for copyright infringement.reverence is also used in non-religious contexts. for example, in the legal contexts of trademark infringement and unfair competition, the word ""reverence"" may be used to describe the behaviour exhibited by a defendant in their attempts to market a product, or to raise an example of the behaviour exhibited by the defendant in their competitors attempts to market their product. in criminal law, the word ""reverence"" may be used to describe the illegitimacy of an action whereby a person who is not the actual perpetrator engages in criminal conduct",0,1

"2016 was a year of transition for mormon women, with the passage of the fiduciary rule and other related changes coming to work on their own. many mormon women are engaged in some form of labor outside the home, for example, and many participate in some form of ministry work outside the home.in 2018, 1.4% of the worlds population was female, and in the united states, 0.9% of the population was female. in other words, nearly all the worlds female population is being supplied by immigrating women into the u.s., who are using the same country the first womens use in the modern era.according to the world bank, in 2018, the average wealth of a woman in brazil was 0,2700011, the gender gap in wealth distribution was the widest in human history. a lower-middle-class woman in the developed world is more likely to have a child at a later age than a poor woman in africa or asia. in the united states, the gap in wealth was widest in the west, and the north was most affected by the rapid urbanization of the poorer classes. in the united states, the wealth of the richest 5% of american households had increased by $66.7\\x80\\x94more than any other country.in matabele republic, some women attained the status of princess, as evidenced by the name of the capital city.the number of women in the world seeking reproductive health services has grown from about one woman for every three men in 1990.a study of young women in africa found that, of all countries studied, africa had the highest infant mortality rate among the nations studied, and that more than a third of the births were to unmarried teenage girls.the number of teenage girls dying within a year has increased in every country studied.influential figures such as bill and melinda freezer, jeremy bluray, and louis altham have suggested that the reason for the disparity is economic. the average man in south africa had a median net worth of $1017 had been married and had no children.in the united states, pregnancy rate varied from 20.7 to 24.3% in 2000, and was 2.5 to 3.3% in 2007. in the united kingdom, pregnancy rate varied from 13.3 to 17.4% in 2000. in switzerland, pregnancy rate varied from 3.0 to 4.4% in 2000. in colombia, it varies from 3.2 to 4.1% in 2000. in india, pregnancy rate varies from 3.0 to 4.3% in 2000.in canada, pregnancy rate varies from 3.3 to 4.4% in 2000. in the united kingdom, pregnancy rate varies from 1.9 to 2.3% in 2004. in the united states, pregnancy rate varies from 1.6 to 2.5% in 2004.in the united states, the rate of births per 1000 people  is higher in the east  and in sub-saharan africa.in the united kingdom, the rate of births per 1000 people   rates of child abuse and neglect are higher in the west and the south, though rates are generally lower in the west and the south.a higher rate of infant mortality has been recorded in the poorer, urbanized, and more rural areas.in the united states, the overall rate of infant mortality has been increasing since the early 1960s. the most recent data for the united states show the birth rate for infants under age one under age one for the years 2007 to 2015. the highest infant mortality rate is recorded in the states of massachusetts, california, and arizona, which together have a population of approximately 4.7011 and 2016, respectively.a number of factors contribute to infant mortality. many of the factors that contribute to infant mortality are present in the developed countries but are much lower in developing countries. for example, the united states and canada are the only developed countries that do not have infant mortality compared to their northern counterparts. in the united states, the rate of infant mortality is higher than in any other industrialised country in the world. higher infant mortality in the united states is more common for women, older mothers, and people of the lower socioeconomic status. higher infant mortality is more common in urban and minority communities. low birth weight, low birth weight ratio, and certain other factors are responsible for most of the higher rates in the developing world.medianemens mortality is higher in developed countries than the unhealthiest nations in the world according to life expectancy at birth. in the united states, the median life expectancy at birth is 76.8 years  for women, the median age is 56.4 years and in the united kingdom it is 74.1 years for men. in africa, the mean life expectancy at birth is 72.1 years one of the main causes of infant mortality is preterm or low birth weight",0,1
"a similar practice was started in june 2009 by the chinese company zhejiang agave. the company is a member of the national agricultural development agency, and was granted a special export credit under chinas policy to cultivate opium. the cultivation of opium was initially approved by the us government, but in 2009 the us stopped supporting opium production, partly because of the japanese and vietnamese seizures of japanese opium in 2009 and 2010.after vietnamese officials discovered the vietnamese were cultivating opium, they began cooperating with the us, which led to a decrease in vietnamese seizures. in 2012, the vietnamese government launched a major anti-drug campaign, and in 2015 nearly half of vietnamese heroin addicts were treated with a prescription drug.on june 23, 2016, china and india signed a framework agreement to develop a middle-class trade relationship in the framework of the world trade organization. the agreement calls for a shift in the global pattern of development away from an oligopoly to a market economy and the establishment of mutually beneficial relationships between the two countries. it also includes the possibility of china and india joining the community of nations  china and india have been discussing the possibility of joining the community of nations  china and india are the biggest importers of chinese-made products and the two largest importers of indian-made products.the chinese government has been actively promoting its ""one country, one system"" policy as a solution for the problems the chinese domestic market poses. the one-country, one-systems approach proposes that all countries cooperate in order to solve the problems of the domestic market. however, according to one of the world banks experts, this is not the most efficient way to resolve the domestic market problems. the problems lie in the political, cultural and bureaucratic arrangements that govern the domestic market.the chinese government has been promoting its one-country, one-system policies as a solution for the chinese domestic market problems. the policy has been particularly effective in controlling the import of indian opium and heroin, which has been a major problem in the country. the one-country, one-systems approach has been criticised for its high taxes and controls on the flow of indian opium.in april 2007, china and india signed a framework agreement, the indian access to china and the chinese markets. the agreement calls for harmonisation and alignment of the border with china, and a new system of chinese and indian border controls. china and india have formed an economic partnership and the chinese government has been encouraging indians to make purchases of chinese goods.the policy of harmonisation and alignment of border controls has been a major success in controlling the import of chinese-made goods in china. the chinese government has been encouraging indians to make purchases of chinese-made goods. the chinese government also controls the manufacture and sale of chinese-made products in china.indias growth has been driven by its infrastructure and the countrys heavy reliance on oil imports. china accounts for about a fifth of chinas exports, which is the largest share of any non-oil exporting economy. china is china 2% of the global population, which is the largest in the world by area. its economic importance to chinas economy is over 7 times that of india. china has an estimated population of 46.7 million, more than three-quarters of whom are urban. china is the worlds largest consumer of chinese imports, which amounts to about 30% of its total imports. china has a significant trade imbalance with the united states. china imports more chinese goods than any other country.china is a member of the non-aligned movement, and its relations with european countries were restored in 1997. it is also a member of the non-aligned group of nations  china has been a member of the non-aligned movement for some time.china has been a member of the non-aligned movement since 1997, but has not been a member of the commonwealth of nations since 2004. in may 2008, china joined the non-aligned movement and became a party to the non-aligned convention, which opened the door for other member states to join in joining china. in 2013, china became a founding member of the organisation for a common foreign policy. the chinese foreign ministry stated that china would seek diplomatic ties with all major countries, asserting that china is an ""open and close bilateral partner of the peoples republic of china"". china has been a founding member of the international financial institutions  china and india are the two largest trading partners of the commonwealth of nations.china is the largest manufacturing country in asia, and the second largest in the world, behind india. chinas manufacturing output in 2015 was the eighth highest in the world, and china is the worlds largest manufacturer",0,1
", a rhinoceros is a large, agile animal that can run at speeds of up to 65 km/h. rhinoceroses have been used for ceremonial purposes in many cultures, including the ancient greeks and the romans. rhinoceroses are also used in traditional medicine since they seem to tolerate high doses of pain without suffering severely. in some traditional cultures, rhinoceroses are symbols of purity, death, and the underworld. rhinoceros horns are used as headdresses in blackface-type ceremonies.there are six species of rhinoceros; six species are native to africa and two are endemic. the species in question are the african black rhinoceros, the indian black rhinoceros, the siberian black rhinoceros, the siberian black rhinoceros, and the northern black rhinoceros. a small population of tcutecaran rhinoceros in china occasionally kill and consume those it has captured for its own purposes. it is believed that the tcutecaran rhinoceros is not aggressive towards humans, but rather follows humans around for its own purposes. the tcutecaran rhino was poached as far away as sicily and cuba, and is known to harass humans on the roads. rhinoceroses have been a part of many legends and romances. rhinoceroses were featured in the writings of shakespeare, and were mentioned in the music of pierre scatially. rhinoceros were mentioned in chinese folklore and were portrayed on stage by han zusheng and wang bi.the rhinoceros was the common name in the amish-moharie community, although the name rhinoceros was in use before european contact.the rhinoceros is an old name, with many sources varying from place to place. the most common and accepted name in english is rhinoceros, but rhinoceros is the more familiar name in the amish-moharie community. rhinoceros is an old english name, but rhinoceros is the more ancient name in the english-speaking world. an archaic english name ""rhinoc"" is recorded in the 13th century, possibly from a chinese word meaning ""great, powerful"".rhinoceros was the common name in china, but the chinese took rhino instead. the name rhinoceros was in use in the amish-moharie community in the 16th century. the amish-moharie name rhinoceri seems to be an anglicization of rhinoceros, which could be a persisting name, or a mutation of rhinoceros. in the 16th century, the name rhinoceri was used in a chinese-language rhyme between two chinese words meaning ""great, powerful"". the chinese word translated as ""rhinoceros"" is thought to have come from an earlier chinese word meaning ""hundred-headed dragon"", which could be an abbreviation of ""hundred dragon"", or ""hundred-headed crane"". since the 1700s, rhinoceri has been a name used by the amish-moharie community to refer to a certain dragon, the hound, an important part of their religious and political symbolism.the amish-moharie name rhinoceri  rhinoceri was probably derived from the chinese word for rhinoceros, which means ""hundred dragon"". the name rhinoceri might have been modified into ""rhinoceros"" in the late 17th century.the name rhinocerotus is attested to 1610:150 the species was probably derived from a greek word, rhinokos. the species was probably introduced into france in the 16th century.the first known use of the name rhinoceros was in the 17th century, when the name ""rhinoceros"" was used in a rhyme scheme with ""eternal"" and ""fever"" to signify the animals perpetual wintering, and was used in the context of a typeface. rhinocerotus was a familiar name to amish people, who had previously used the name tennessee, to distinguish themselves from the nameless animals of the region, now styled as ""trees"", and to refer to the forest that they inhabited. the name rhinoceros was still used in the context of trade in the 18th century.the name rhinoceros was first recorded in 1783, in the journal of the royal society of england. the first printed use of the name came in 1841 in the report by josiah wyatt, the customs officer, who visited the xhosa people in the year 1785. through a series of misbegotten appeals and in an",0,1
"2013 was a breakthrough year for the anuran society, with the first murder of auran member of congress, anry abdullah, under mysterious circumstances. no details of the crime were revealed, though the police and the sharia police speculated that it may have been a result of a botched drug delivery attempt. in june, the high commissioner of ireland, commodore john newsham, called for an end to the ""murderous and barbaric"" practices of the sharia police, and assured the irish people of safety.in july 2013, president mr. zuma announced an end to state support for sharia. the government of south africa also removed support for sharia from its national security policy, a move denounced by south african president jacob zuma who said: ""the sharia police state will bring sharia to south africa"". in october, the south african sharia police arrested an alleged sharia bank robber who was connected to the oid, and released a video claiming credit for the successful robbery.on 15 may 2013, a suspected sharia terrorist attacked a checkpoint on south west highway in ugandan national police headquarters, the kruger national park. the suspect, a columbian national, was shot and killed by police. the suspect was identified as ashok goel, assistant security chief for the south west regional police. the incident came amid a heightened police presence in the park in response to the park being considered a safe haven for illegal migrants.on 11 june 2013, a south african-born u.s. judge ruled that the jamaat al-muslim brotherhood can enter ugandan national parks via auwal. the decision was welcomed by the government of the united arab emirates which said it is considering the move.on 13 july 2013, a south african-born judge ruled that jamaat al-muslims can enter unescos unescos national park, unguja. the ruling came after a south african national was arrested at the border crossing between south sudan and uganda.the lack of impact of sharia law has been highlighted in the media and public debate, with the islamist threat being cited as a prominent example. however, the law remains little more than an ideology that has been adopted by the leadership of each country and its militias.territorial and cultural control must be maintained in order to maintain the unity of the peoples of the world while addressing international threats from terrorism, war, diseases, migrants, crime, and aggression. this requires the use of religion as a basis for decisions, such as the protection of national symbols, or the preservation of religious and cultural traditions.a public health emergency is a public health care system that provides services and supplies to the general public in a manner that is fair, efficient, and transparent.in the united states,

number of people that die in developed countries is about 2.5% higher than in developing countries. in absolute terms, the richest countries have the highest death rates, while the poorest countries are the least healthy, with the top five countries, which have the highest per capita rate of overall death rates, having the highest overall death rates.the most common causes of death in 2017 were heart disease and respiratory disease, cancer, and diabetes. causes of death increased in all age groups, and for all ages groups except the oldest, who are now the prime sources for death. a variety of causes have been identified or hypothesized to be involved in the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases, including obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and certain types of cancer.the majority of deaths occur in the developing world, although emigration has increased the number of people dying in the developing world. population trends, such as births to fewer than age 65 leads to

"1956. the second in the series, titled ""the curious case of the roses"", depicts the first encounter between the two principal characters, mark and linda. mark is now a professor at the university of alabamas law school and linda is a correspondent for the drama critic derek sheridan. the show ran for eight seasons and was nominated for five primetime emmy awards, three tv guide awards, and a starz childrens magazine readership choice award. it was created by andrew sheridan, a real-life partner of mark sheridan, and courteney kellerman, a longtime mark sheridan associate. the series was adapted by robert gerber, a visiting writer for the show.the nbc sitcom the love guru based on the series starred robert gerber as mark sheridan and brianne gardner as linda. the show was created by thom stewart, a former bbc comedy writer who had worked in the advertising department. the series was followed by a second, titled the love guru, which starred chris parnell as mark sheridan and ben wyatt as danny angela over the course of three seasons.the collection of short stories known as the roses saga was adapted in the works by fred valentino and linda ruppert in magna cum laude, published posthumously in 1977. the books were soon adapted in spin-off novels, and a fourth volume, the roses saga: stories from the vault by eddy kitsis, was released in 2014.the first two seasons of the series were created by andrew sheridan, while the third season was written by james fadiman and david robbins.the show was created by andrew sheridan, david robbins, and eddy kitsis; and the fourth season was written by andrew sheridan. the first season was set in an unspecified locale in the u.s. and was not connected to any of the other shows. the setting of the series was a bit off-center, with the central character, mark, living in la ciotat, a fictional town in the mid-atlantic united states. the shows writers included andrew sheridan, jay mohr, and charles mcdougall, with the writing team calling themselves ""the boys of the late 1970s"". the producers were concerned that the show would be perceived as an anti-muslim show. they also hoped to avoid the problem of the identity of the characters, i.e., mohr and michaelss, who were often perceived as anti-muslim. the show was broadcast by nbc in the united states, ireland, canada, new zealand, australia, russia, and turkey. after the first season, the show was shown in over 110 countries. the first season also featured a cast of performers, including actors who had appeared on the show before, such as julie rubin, the muppets, and carrie billinson, who had also appeared on the show before. for the second season, the cast was reduced to three, and the show was shown in asia and latin america and latin americas only. in the third season, the cast was reduced to one, and the show was shown in both europe and asia.the producers hired author harry vaughan for the job of a showrunner. vaughan had been a writer for the salem, virginia, and the maryland territories and had been a successful author of childrens books, as well as a novelist. though he was well known for his books, he was a relatively unknown author in the u.s. until his death in 1993.the first season focused on four women trying to get to the center of the rosewood cluster, a region of the country where new homes were being built on the cheap and old homes being torn down. the four women were paraded in a circus; four of them fell in love and married each other. the wives were romantically involved; linda proposed to mark; danny, one of the cab drivers, fell in love with linda; and the last woman, cherie, was romantically involved with mark.mark and linda meet at the center of the rosewood cluster, which is a fictional place in north carolina. the first place in the cluster is a warehouse. mark and linda go to this warehouse to look for a job. the warehouse is a fictional version of a real place in the u.s. it is here that the women meet danny angela, an old-timey-type character from the cab drivers book series, who is also their landlord and employer. danny explains to them that the place is a dystopia, a fictional dystopia, and that the reason for this is because of the poor quality of cab drivers. mark and linda then decide to go in search of cab drivers",0,1
"salt-to-water ratio is a great indicator of the water quality of a river. many rivers have a low or average salt level, which makes navigation difficult. salt levels vary from well-watering sediments to brackish water. salt levels in rivers are determined by salt concentrations in salt crystals and rock strata, and deposited organic chemicals. the presence or absence of salt in a river also affects the visibility and conductivity of rivers.the salinity of rivers also affect the appearance of rivers, which can be affected by the appearance of salt crystals or by the amount of organic chemicals present in the water. salts can also appear as white particles or as a dark, yellow disc in rivers. the appearance of light, fluffy, or plumper salts after rainfall or a fish kill is a good indication that the water is more alkaline than before the rains had washed away sedimentary rocks. on the other hand, deep yellow discoloration that appears in rivers after heavy rains may indicate a salt water leak, which is usually reversible by evaporation or by chemical decomposition. for this reason, most river navigation centers are located near sea level, about 2000 m on land, and about 3000 m in the deepest reaches of the oceans. on land, the ocean can hold about twice the weight of land.the earliest recorded navigation across a river was by the australian schooner philippe maréchal in 1683, who claimed to have navigated 43 rivers of india.the first recorded navigation along a paved road or path was by the french philippe de valladurai in 1749. he navigated the nations longest river, the ambe, between france and britain. the earliest paved road to the ocean, the ambe, was navigated by the french artist louis kh0th century, a number of large corporations began establishing themselves along rivers for the purpose of avoiding the difficulties encountered by ships and other boats in attempting to cross rivers. this practice was called ""river navigation"". common causes of river navigation are the following:many rivers have names that trace back to pre-historic navigation. for example, palestine, named after the ancient palisadean river, is named after the ancient river of pi. some of the most famous navigators of rivers are the ans have been the river navigators of the ans in the area of the egyptian pyramids. the ans have built a large navigational network along the egyptian and spanish colonial palisades. the ans established several routes through the desert, using outrigger canoe and alluvial canoe systems.the ans made many navigational innovations over their long history, and the most well known route is the ans route through to lebanon. the ans made extensive use of a navigational system that they built themselves, and this system continued to be built into the ans history. many navigators used the routes of the ans, or constructed routes around the ancient navigational centre of mecca, the citadela.the ans route to lebanon was built between 1385 and 1450 by the philippines. the ans route to kaffa was built between 1383 and 1423 by the guinean navigator juan de la paz de la paz.the historical ambe river navigation is conducted by the ans in area of the coloma.the ans invented the alluvial canoe system used by the philippines. the system was completed between 1534 and 1538. the ans made many navigational changes in the years 1535 to 1539, to accommodate the needs of the spanish colonisers. the ans also adopted artificial waves for alluvial rivers, which were millions of years ago. the ans also invented the alluvial navigation system for artificial rivers, which were millions of years ago.the ans river navigation routes are built in an effort to improve navigation for people, ships, and boats. the routes are named after the rivers in the ambe and nile belt that are navigable by sea. there are two main routes to the various ans river cities. the first and easiest of the routes is the ambe-nile path. the ans have also constructed many routes around the ans, the egyptian route being the most recent. the mara river, which was named after the river of might, is the ans river of azaaraknun.the second and more difficult route is the ambe-mara path. the ans have constructed several routes around the mara river.  the most direct route is the nile-egyptian route. people have navigated the river for many centuries, but no navigator has been able to cross it continuously for more than two thousand years.the ans also constructed a navigational path to the west of the sahara that was navigated by the philippines. the ans also built a route to the southwest of the sahara, and constructed a small bridge across the sahara 1,",0,1
"hybrid warfare was the use of firearms and explosives to initiate a fire war. the battlefield was the enclosed space between opposing armies, specifically between the armies of the two major world powers, the united states and the soviet union. a more extensive form of warfare, forms of open warfare and guerrilla warfare, were employed in both world wars. a recent study by daniel kahn, professor of history and public policy at the yale school of management, suggests that the notion of ""peace in a glass bottle"" is not quite accurate. rather, it is more accurate to say that the perception of the ""peace in a glass bottle"" was a key factor in unearthing effective counter-weapons, because it was the key to understanding and creating the innovative weapons systems that were used to defeat the soviets.the first weapon used in world war i was the musket, which was first used by the u.s. military in the american civil war. the muskets design was inspired by the thunderer, a late 18th-century water cannonister. the thunderer was a hand-held weapon which used water as propellant and was used in both world wars. however, the muskets design changed in several important ways from the muskets of the first world war. it was designed to be fired from a variety of angles, to accommodate different grips, and to provide a more comfortable fit. the muskets design also had several key features which later appeared standardised in all modern machine guns, including the bolt-action machine gun and the use of a threaded barrel for cocking.the next weapon used was the sawed-off shotgun, which was first used by the u.s. military in the american civil war and then used by the british military in world war i. the sawed-off was used throughout the first world war. it was the first weapon for which a reliable definition can be found, as it was the weapon adopted by the victors, not the original author. it was also the first non-lethal weapon used by the victors which can be traced back to the beginning of the war. the last weapon used by the victors was the bayonet which was first used by the french military in world war ii, used by the french army. however, the preferred term for this weapon by historians is ""jouissance"".the last weapon to be used in large-scale warfare was the machine gun. during the first world war, machine guns were used by both sides. the english-speaking world used machine guns while the british used machine guns primarily. however, as the war progressed, the use of machine guns by either side declined. the united states military and the british military had a monopoly on machine guns until the end of world war i, when canadian militia groups started to use machine guns. the united states placed machine guns under state control until the end of world war ii, when canada surrendered. the british retained machine guns for use by the royal navy, through the 1940s and 1950s.the final weapon used by both sides was the hand grenade, which was used by both sides. the hand grenade was the most widely used weapon in the conflict, although it was only used by the victors, and only by the united states that were directly involved in the war.  the use of hand grenades by both sides is the subject of much debate among historians of the conflict. most historians believe the hand grenade was first used by the french in the battle of the argentine in april 1914. by the end of the war, hand grenades were already used by the french, russian and austro-hungarian navies.the last weapon used by both sides was the rocket launcher. the french used rockets for launching the first, second and third wave of grenades. the russian navy used similar weapons, but the austro-hungarian navy did not use rockets, because it had no missiles capable of firing them.the last weapon used by both sides was the artillery piece used by the french in the battle of the argentine. the artillery piece used by the french was a type of grenade launcher similar to the american anti-tank weapon. the french used a variety of grenade launchers, including hand grenades, these weapons were used in a series of engagements in the last three phases of the conflict. at the battle of the argentine, the russian used a series of hand grenades which did not appear to have been designed specifically for use in a direct conflict with a franco-soviet rocket launcher.the last major armed conflict to occur during the war was the battle of the argentine, a battle for the strategic and symbolic space between the french and the united states. the war ended when the french declared the independence of the philippines in 1913, after the united states and british had joined the war, and the french-speaking peoples republic of china declared independence in 1915. the",0,1

"thomas schleidenschlager and colleagues found that the number of genes in the dna of sterile snakes varied from 9% to 49% different. they suggested that this dna is ""effectively random"", i.e. that it has no function. this finding has important implications for many aspects of snake biology, including snake sex selection, snake phylogenetics, and snake sexual behavior. this randomness is of interest to biologists generally, especially in the development of snake ion channels, snake recombination, and snake morphology. it also has important implications in ecology where it has played a central role in evolutionary analyses of snake adaptive radiation.genome-wide data from four populations of redback snake showed that there are more global variants of rs-xrn2 in snakes than in any other primate, including humans. this random effect is likely caused by the fact that the populations differ in phylogenetic standing, and so are genetically more similar to each other than to other populations. it is also relevant to the study of ""species difference"" in evolutionary tree analysis, in which taxonomic standing is used to demonstrate that particular taxa have more unique evolutionary patterns  or ""stochastic mutation"" as it is more commonly called. one explanation is that the variation is caused by a multidirectional mechanism involving multiple negative feedbacks. this could also be due to positive feedback, whereby the environment changes and the mutation carriers reproduce the variation.routes may also be responsible for snake mutation. the back-ranch snake eel  like most venomous snakes, the back-ranch snake eel has a single protein that is responsible for the pain it inflicts. the protein used to make the pain signal is located in the sialodacryoadl area of the snake. this pain is responsible for the sensation of pain in the snake, and it is this protein that has been lost in all modern rangemates and pandas. the only other snakes, besides the back-ranch snake, that have lost this ability are the mallard pythons.the back-ranch snake is the only snake of the family lepidoptera that also produce a snake-like characteristic, the tail. the tail is composed of two distinct groups of protein, the back group  the protein used to make the tail structure is located in the back of the snake, and is named the peltier peltier. the peltier peltier is a protein rich in protein and is responsible for the warm, sticky feeling the snake gives off when being handled. this type of protein is lost in most other snakes and is lost in all subspecies of snakes prior to the back-ranch snake, only the in-between groups of snakes such as the caspian snake and the palomar indian snake possess this protein and are therefore classified as distinct species.the following table presents the phylogenetic tree of extant snakes:the three living species of python can be divided into the two subspecies, the ""live"" and the ""dead"" snakes respectively. the ""dead"" snakes are those that have not evolved many different behaviors, and so are not included in the treatment of the live snakes.the word ""python""  was used in the 19th century to denote dead animals and humans.the word ""pythons"" comes from the persian word pyth, meaning ""flesh"", and the word python, meaning ""kingdom or kingdom"".the arabic word ""yemen""  from yemen, the persian word for ""kingdom"" was pyu, a variant of pak.the arabic word ""alam"" means ""heaven, high, lofty"". in fact, the arabic word for ""heaven"" is pak. the arabic word for ""heaven"" is pyur, the persian word for ""high"" is ahmad.the korean word for ""heaven"" is ngun.the chinese word for ""heaven"" is na.the arabic word for ""heaven"" is na.the chinese word for ""heaven"" is nu.the chinese word for ""heaven"" is pn.the chinese word for ""heaven"" is nu.the chinese word for ""heaven"" is pn.the arabic word for ""heaven"" is pn.the arabic word for ""heaven"" is pn.the arabic word for ""heaven"" is pn.the arabic word for ""heaven"" is pn.the arabic word for ""heaven"" is pn.the arabic word for ""heaven"" is pn.the arabic word for ""heaven"" is pn.the arabic word for ""heaven"" in sunda, thailand, is ""mijut"". it means ""pleasant, tranquil, fair"".in french, sunda means ""pleasant, tranquil,",0,1

"hybrid model of the competitive species in the family capybaras, orychophagus capensis, with the hybrid species represented by the genera hydrinodontia and hydrinodontia in the family capybarahidae, orychophagus capensis, and hydrinodontia flavipinnis.the ancestors of modern ruminants evolved from the oryx, which became closely associated with the oryx. the ancestor of the modern ruminant species likely evolved from the oryx sometime before 7010. the southern woodlands ruminant community estimates that about 1 million years ago. ruminants are thought to have split off from the oryx about 7.5.3 million years ago. the southern woodlands ruminant community estimates that about 1 million years ago, which is close to the time of the dinosaurs. the southern woodlands ruminant community estimates that the ruminant split occurred 7.5 million years ago. in 2019, the u.s. national geographic family ranked the ruminant split as the ninth great extinction event of all time.the ruminant clade a. rex can be distinguished from other ruminants by the shape of its mammary teeth. the largest of these are on the left side of the animal, which grow continuously from the base of the tail, while the smaller ones are on the right side of the animal. the mammary ridges become longer as the animal continues to grow, becoming fangs-like structures.the first ruminants to evolve biting means, with the earliest known evidence dated to 200 million years ago. ruminants that are well adapted for biting are called toothed whales and hippopotamuses. for example, the basking shark can bite more than 50,000 times per second, while the krill can easily tear through grape vines six times in a single bite. the earliest known evidence for ruminants that can use their fangs to pierce grape vines is in the fossil record from the paleozoic age, around 220 million years ago, in which the hippopotamus-like ruminant chelonnose may have done so. another example is the dog-sized chimp leoniophrynidinae, which can also bite vine-dwelling mammals like the thylacine.the first ruminants to have well-developed jaws have been found in the paleozoic age. dna from this site has been used to reconstruct the jaws of the woolly rhinoceros, which have been found to have a well-developed jaw base, to 65% of the original length. other sites in the same taxonomic group, such as those of the palaeotragus, have been found to have a lower jaw base.the most primitive fossils of ruminants date to the earliest parts of the cenozoic period, from 290 to 205 million years ago. the soft tissue fossils from the teeth of mammals, birds and sea life show that they were very sticky and sticky in the early stages, but became much less sticky as more muscle tissue was added. in some cases, as in the woolly rhinoceros, the muscle attachment sites are more firmly attached than in other cases where the attachment sites are spread out. this is supported by the presence of collagenase, a protein involved in the structural and biological role of adhesive bands used by most animals. the presence of this protein also makes it possible to successfully apply force to other organisms and subsequently gain leverage to hold onto them.the earliest macropods, ammonites, were about 520 million years ago. the most recent common ancestor of all modern ruminants may be 320 million years old, found in amber from south africa.the earliest known ruminants have been found in amber from germany in 1947, and the united states in 1986.the first ruminants were characterized by their sticky, white or ""egg""like skin and the shape of a carapace. the skin and carapace make it possible to distinguish ruminants from invertebrates.these ruminants were most closely related to modern humans, as they shared a close evolutionary relationship with humans. the oldest known fossil ruminants date back to the Paleogene period  at the same time, there are many archaic human remains that are associated with sites where ruminants were hunted to extinction. it is likely that the ruminants were a result of a trade between humans and the cladontids prior to the spread of agriculture, as ruminants were considered to be more valuable to the hunters because of their color and the potential for them to be used as shell or bone substitutes. it is possible that ruminants were important to the omnivorous Homo erectus as well as the humans that migrated into the new world, as the cladontids were more active hunters and had been observed to consume ruminants.the ruminants that have been excavated so",0,1
"harry king, the fifth president of the united states, was mostly an abolitionist. john wilkes booth, the fifteenth president of the united states, was also mostly an abolitionist. kaiser alfred von thurn und soll, the first chancellor of the dutch republic, was a strict constructionist. german militarism, which the empire sought to destroy, was also mostly abolitionist.the abolitionist movement in the united states was largely confined to the south and the west. during the antebellum period, the west did not include the remainder of the south. the movement tended to be small, active, and focused on government policy and the abolition of slavery. the movement spread throughout the midwest, east, and north.the ninth amendment of the colorado constitution of 1866 included a civil service position for african americans. the interstate compact of 1887 required the states to provide equal rights to ""all other citizens"". however, african americans were denied that right in the icc. they were denied voting rights, safe drinking water, and access to other public services, including the schools. in 1891 the dutch republic, a coalition of slave-holding southern states, signed the treaty of versailles, which also included the demand for prohibition of alcoholic beverages. the north refused to ratify the treaty, and south carolina refused to enforce its provisions, leading to the two-state compromise. the states were forced to compromise and the treaty of versailles was signed in november 1894. the states remained bound by the icc and the treaty of versailles, but they could either abolish it or implement it, as they wished. the states continued to struggle with poverty and racial discrimination, and eventually switched to a gold standard.the post-bellum south incorporated african-american institutions and laws, such as school prayer, the bicentennial celebration of the ennobling of a white government official, and the voting rights act of 1870. in the post-bellum west, african-american institutions continued, including the federal system of government-sponsored schools, the national government, and the system of government-subordinated unions. the thirteenth amendment was passed by the u.s. congress and became the thirteenth amendment in 1875. the amendment affirmed the equal protection of the laws and prohibited the states from denying any persons federal citizenship, except under the power of the federal government. the thirteenth amendment was the last significant piece of post-bellum legislation before the civil war. the civil rights movement in the north did not completely resolve the problems of the south, as racial discrimination continued unabated.after the civil war, the federal government was heavily expanded under the administrations of harry w. curtiss and george w. bush to become the united states, the first post-colonial superpower. the u.s.S. government sponsored welfare, social security, veterans affairs, and the national defense program began to decline as the population grew. welfare was cut back to the level of the late 19th century, with most government services provided by the private sector.the first baby boom in the u.s. economy occurred in the decade from 1947 to 1958. the baby boom generation contributed in part to the increasing prominence of women in professional and business life. marriage declined as a means of securing economic independence, as wives became responsible for the domestic marriage. infant mortality rates rose dramatically from the 1920s, rising from 14.8 per 1,000 live births in the 1920s to 29.7 in 1958.in the post-1960s period, the rate of childlessness declined from a high of 68% in the 1920s to 37% in the 1960s; this trend reversed in the late 1980s and began to accelerate in the 1990s. the rate of childlessness increased in the 2000s and continues to increase today.the post-1960s baby boom generation contributed in part to the aging population. the baby boomers, born between 1946 and 1964, experienced a net loss of labor, defined as the number of persons aged 25 to 64 years who were not married and aged 16 or 17 in the u.s. census of persons aged 25 to 64 years. the labor force participation rate of this group was 31.6% in 20070008.according to the census of population, the average age in the u.s. is 52.1 years. the u.s. population was estimated to be 675.6 million in 2019 according to a total population estimate. this number includes those who did not ask for or complete a citizenship. the u.s. population peaked at 675.3 million in the year ending march 31, 2019.as of 2011, the three most common immigrant origins in the u.s. are: naturalized u.s. citizen  in the u.s. about 82% of the population is non-citizen. non-citizen immigrants are those immigrants who did not become citizens through",0,1

traditional clothing or they may be a complete ensemble with a choice of footwear. different cultures wear different styles of clothing, and so different pieces may be worn by different groups. for example, westerners are more likely to wear sailor blue than sikh bikinis. in other countries, cultural traditions and political systems have favored one particular piece of clothing, so traditional clothing is much more common, or may be completely banned altogether.in some cultures, people wear clothing to signify their identity, such as wearing clothes to show respect or to show their commitment to a certain social group or cause. for example, wearing shirts with a black hat represents the black community, and a shirt that is red, white, and blue represents the united states. this is known as ""colour-blind"" or ""color-inclusive"" clothing, which means that it is not just the colour that matters, but also the style, texture and pattern. in other cultures, people may wear only certain colours, or only for a certain group or community. this can be in contrast to the idea of ""gender-inclusive"" clothing where everyone can wear whatever they wish.in a study of american college students, researchers found that the majority of students associated ""being a girl"" with wearing a dress, and that the majority of students associate being a boy with wearing a dress.in british culture, gender roles are an important factor in everyday life. for example, a woman who fits the traditional gender role may find herself in the gender neutral clothing, and a man who does not may find himself in the gender stereotype clothes.gendai  and other yidaki. gender neutral pronouns are used by the majority of the populace meaning ""everyone"" is not the primary objective of the movement, although it is a registered movement.the goal of the anti-poverty group, unicef, is to eliminate gender stereotypes in the world through effective communication, financial and material assistance for gender-nonconforming people, and through advocacy of gender nonconforming people.unicef works to change attitudes of social acceptance and tolerance of gender stereotypes, including gender stereotypes that perpetuate discrimination. there are several ways people can help prevent gender stereotypes from negatively impacting their daily lives. the most common method is to make people aware of gender stereotypes and the negative impact they can have on their everyday life. another method is to present gender stereotypes in a positive light, which will cause the individual to change their behavior. finally, one can try changing the way people think about gender.people can also help prevent gender stereotypes by making themselves more present in the present. this involves creating a positive mental image of oneself, and reducing negative thoughts about gender.the term gender stereotype was first used by gilbert herdt, an evolutionary biologist and behavioural biologist, in a talk entitled ""the biological differences of humans and other animals"" at the university of wisconsin, in 1971, at the annual symposium on evolutionary biology. the term has since been used to refer to a variety of beliefs and behaviours, including gender stereotypes.the term gender stereotype has been used to refer to a range of negative attitudes that individuals usually hold regarding gender, and which can be found in both general population samples and individuals with certain personality disorders.individuals can fall into four main groups:the term gender stereotype is used to refer to the range of negative attitudes that individuals usually have toward gender. this refers to the range of behaviours that individuals usually keep to the idea that ""men are stronger than women"", ""women are inferior to men"", ""men are better than women"", or ""men are better than women"". although the term gender stereotype has been used to refer to a broad range of negative attitudes, it is most often used in relation to gender stereotypes. these negative attitudes towards gender are often found in individuals who have embraced gender stereotypes and who often hold negative attitudes towards both males and females.negative attitudes towards gender are a function of the individuals race, ancestry, and nationality. for example, in the united states, ""nerds are more likely to say men are better than women"", whereas in scandinavia, ""women are more likely to say men are better than women"". although stereotypes about gender are not universal across all societies, they are found to be most prevalent among young people in most societies.gendai presents research based on gender stereotypes and race/ethnicity as two examples of stereotypes used to explain gender gap. the first stereotype is that men are better than women in every respect, while women are usually considered to be on the lower end of the gender spectrum in terms of social acceptability. the second stereotype is that men are better than women in everything, including math and science.gendai presents the results of a survey conducted in 178 societies to determine the extent and nature of gender stereotypes. the stereotypes that individuals believe are most widespread among women, and men, in g",0,1
" the act of cutting the cord is called a ""cutie run"". a cutie run is defined as a sequence of three consecutive episodes, where the primary difference between the first and last ""episode"" is that the episode does not have a title. cutie runs are typically depicted as three-chambered but can also be depicted as three-chambered-end with the main difference being which chalice is used. the term cutie refers to any child cheerleader, mare, or mule. the show uses a very loose interpretation of the term ""cutie"" and refers to the act of running around with a stuffed animal, usually a baby or an infant, wrapped in white paper. the act of cutting the cord is called a ""cutie run"". a cutie run is described as follows:the term ""cutie"" has been in use since the middle of the eighteenth century, when the english language began to diverge from the practice of initialism  the pattern of having ""cords"" starting with a ""y"" and ending in a ""c"" in the first episode of a series pattern is known as the medieval ""cutie run"". the name was changed in the 1950s to ""cut"" + (episode + (characters + (title) in the late 20th century, the term ""cutie"" was used by some fans to denote a female character, especially a mare, and as such the character in question is sometimes called a ""cutie"" instead of a ""maiden"" or a ""maiden-san"". the term ""maiden"" is preferred by many fans, but the term ""maiden-san"" is preferred by fewer fans. the term ""maiden"" is more commonly used to describe characters who are not female but who are somehow related to the female protagonist, such as the cat owner in the shakespearean quartet, or the owner of the mirror in hattori. the term ""maiden-san"" is preferred by older readers, but the term ""maiden-san"" is preferred by younger readers. the term ""cutie run"" is preferred by many female fans, but is less often used in male fan fiction.the female cutie has been a popular genre in childrens literature. the first story written in 1875 by c.w. hartley featured a character who is ""cutie run"" as a way to introduce a character who can be a child, although the character was only ever described as a ""maiden-san"". other stories, such as d. h. lawrys ""the cutie & the red head"" in 1892 and frederick sargeant and anthony shager ""the cutie & the red head"" in 1897, used descriptions of cutie runs or cutouts to introduce more complex characterizations of the group, such as the ""aunt ra"" of johann henderson. the characters in the stories are largely set in the cutie run setting, but they are allowed to describe more than one, as well as use descriptions of cutouts to complement the main story. an example is the 1894 novella the cutie and the red head, which is about a girl who falls in love with a very handsome prince. the story is told by the cutie and red head together.""the anime medium is used in many forms. the anime format is most often used for short stories and short stories, often featuring a single main character, often a child, with little to no characterization other than their looks. the popularity of these types of works is tied to the popularity of certain key elements, such as the format of the ""two-panel spread"", the use of female pronouns, the use of sexual content, and the fact that the story is set in a magical world. the characters themselves are often drawn very deliberately, with expressive facial features, and often with unusual background costumes. the length of the stories is often measured in the panels that accompany each story, and the presentation of the story as a whole is often accompanied by music or sound, which are often elaborate. often, the music is composed by the same individual who wrote the story, with the story used as a background. each story may be plotted by hand, with the plot itself arranged on a map. the artwork for these types of works often comes from the same place, such as the source material being a colored pencil drawing or charcoal illustration. some anime works are produced by companies that are subsidiaries of larger companies such as nippon express, longsword, and gohan. these works are often done in color, although the work is often done in black and white as well. these works are often written on paper as well as on animation film, which is colored pencil on a paper stock. when done well, the animation is very precise, with precise timing and precise movements in both directions. these works are often very graphic, and include things such as blood, semen, and scottish dubs",0,1
"stebbins, a young british chemist, had been experimenting with the use of dichloromethane in the manufacture of bis(1-trvo-di-ethanol, a strong ethylene glycol which he had prepared by the conversion of a crude di-ethanol into a crystalline form. he had also developed a second method of using ethylene glycol to produce di-ethanol from a crude glycerine. however, he had been unable to reproduce the di-ethanol-based method in catalysis since he had used ethylene glycol with a stabilizer, which he had not been able to remove the stabilizer with a catalyst. he had, however, succeeded in producing a new form of ethylene glycol which did not require any such stabilizers. moreover, he had also developed an inexpensive, readily available, and effective catalyst which he had not anticipated. as a result, in 1874, he had been able to produce the first hydrogen peroxide and the first ethylene glycol.the rate of technological advancement in the materials science and engineering disciplines remained slow until the early twentieth century. in 1914, british chemists james williamson and charles wheatstone built the first practical and widely used hydrogen peroxide, from perchlorophenol which they had synthesized from perchlorophenol in 1872. the hydrogen peroxide was first tested on a cigarette and later on a vaccine against yellow fever in 1920. wheatstone was awarded the nobel prize in chemistry for his contributions in the field. throughout the next few decades, these discoveries were increasingly incorporated into the engineering disciplines, such as engineering, mechanical engineering, and instrumentation. while the study of materials science and engineering remained a relatively small part of engineering, the development of new materials exceeded the engineering expertise of most engineers.the first industrial robots responsible for the manipulation of materials were invented in the mid-19th century. today, there are approximately 1,000 industrial robots in use. the majority of them are small, easily controllable, and self-steeped.the chemical reactions and materials science of the past three millennia bce, first inorganic antimony, then inorganic copper and then inorganic zinc gave rise to inorganic tin, inorganic lead, and inorganic copper all of which were used by the abbasid empire to make weapons and other articles, leading to the collapse of the old iron age.the european exploration of the moon and mars, landing on the south pole and eventually reaching the moon and mars, formed the basis for much of the technology and science to be used on the american, european, and other continents. the search for new materials and new technologies was part of the search for ""better inventions"", beginning with the pyramids at the beginning of the 19th century. the beginning of this period was followed by the discovery and development of the chemical and physical reaction combined chemistry, the fundamental branch of chemistry, in the 20th century. the discovery of the chemical energy and its application to the final cause of matter formation, the electron, led to the development of modern chemical engines, power plants, catalysts, and synthetic leather.in the past few centuries, many cultures have been built upon the materials that formed the basis of their civilization. these construction sites often bore witness to the construction of the structures themselves. one particularly impressive building was the great temple of bethlem, the second-tallest building in the world, but it was probably completed much earlier.the beginnings of the industrial revolution in the 19th century were closely connected with the spread of science and technology. the invention of the steam engine, a method of direct propulsion, opened a new direction for travel, enabling people to travel more easily and at a greater speed. the discovery of the internal combustion engine, a method of avoiding the use of fuel, opened a new path for the manufacture of goods. the discovery of electricity, the source of current, opened a new path for the manufacture of electricity. the mechanisation of production, the mechanisation of transport, the mechanisation of production, the mechanisation of assembly, and the mechanisation of mass-production were all the result of discoveries in the industrial revolution. the rise of rail transport, the ferrofluidics, and the use of steam power, and the electric motors, electric motors, and the electric arc, opened a new direction for industrial production. manufacturing production was the most important manufacturing sector in 1855, when the first integrated assembly plant was opened at the bremmerbach plant in germany. new factories were built to meet the increasing demand for motor vehicles.the rapid growth of the modern industrial system in the 20th century, coupled with the increasing role of machines in supporting and mechanising the production of goods, has led to the transformation of manufacturing in the 21st century. in the 2009 manufacturing year, machining and machining services were the top three in the world, while machining production was the largest manufacturer of goods",0,1
" killjoys is a comedy of errors that began as a parody of british television series the office in 1994. the premise is that the job of a job seeker is to invite misfortune onto himself by committing a crime. the show examines the ethical dilemma of deciding whether to murder someone because he or she seems to be suffering from some ailment and therefore should have some misfortune on the fateful day. the show has been adapted as a play on the british work-ethic series, that features a medical drama with a fictional investigation into a possible illness. the show has also been adapted for film, with the 2009 film the office directed by michael schur that was released to mixed critical and commercial success.the characters are taken from real-life situations and situations are interspersed with humorous dialogue. the setting of the show is fictional, with the characters using real-life situations such as hospital settings, business meetings, and funerals as situations to create the tone of the show. the characters are not real, but a parody of life, and the goal of the parody is to see how the characters react to that situation in real life. the characters are not deliberately realistic, but are realistic in their interpretations of events. the show was a joint venture between the cbs comedy series and the production company, comedy central, which produced the series for nine seasons. killjoys was acquired by the comedy central production company in 2012.the show was created by alan di perna, co-creator of the office and a writer on the office. producer james cameron, a writer on the office, also worked as a writer on the show. the show was directed by cameron and written by him. rob mink, the co-creator and showrunner of the office, wrote some of the episodes. mink was the one who ultimately decided which characters should be killed off. he also serves as the executive producer, and several of the other writers serve as producers. the show was written by perna and cameron, while executive producers are michael schur, kristen graceier and troy miller. other writers include: aisha bhtari, aisha burley, julie dippoldi, fabian jacobson, jay krane, andy samberg, andy samloe, andy move, who has credited for writing and starring in the episode ""i think shes dead"".in august 2018, the show was nominated for a primetime emmy award for outstanding comedy special.the series was nominated for eleven primetime emmy award nominations, including four for best comedy series, in the late 1990s, including three for the primetime emmy award.the series was nominated for five primetime emmy award nominations, including four for best comedy series, in the late 1990s, including three for the primetime emmy award.the series was nominated for five primetime emmy award nominations, including three for best comedy series, in the late 1990s, including three for the primetime emmy award.the series was nominated for four primetime emmy award nominations, including two for best comedy series, in the late 1990s, including one for ""rock show"".the series was nominated for four primetime emmy award nominations, including two for best comedy series, in the late 1990s, including one for ""rock show"".the series was nominated for four primetime emmy award nominations, including two for best comedy series, in the late 1990s, including one for ""rock show"".two of the four emmy award nominations were won by the series, while a third award went to a live-action short-form miniseries. the series was nominated for four primetime emmy award for best comedy series.the series was nominated for three primetime emmy award nominations, including one for ""rock show"", in the late 1990s.the series was nominated for three primetime emmy award nominations, including one for ""rock show"", in the late 1990s.the series was nominated for three primetime emmy award nominations, including one for ""rock show"", in the late 1990s.on december 9, 2006, the series was nominated for three primetime emmy award for outstanding comedy special. the emmy awards were presented the same year to a short-form series based on the book the emmy program, and a second-form based on the book the emmy program: the memoirs of the most important people in television. the first and second-form episodes were both nominated for best picture and best director at the 51st primetime emmy awards.the series was nominated for four primetime emmy award nominations, including one for ""rock show"" and two for ""emmy: show me the money"", in the late 1990s.the series was nominated for four primetime emmy award nominations, including one for ""emmy: show me the money"", in the late 1990s.the series was nominated for",0,1
"answers to the original question, if a man could get fifty cents in a store with his hands on the register, would he not sell? the reply, ""yes"" was the easy answer, and the message was clear. the man had not consulted the store owner or the clerks to ask whether the sale of that coin was possible or desirable. the salesman had simply told them he was willing to pay that much just to avoid having to ask the customer to pay twice. the salesman was not an expert on sales, but he had been in it for 30 years and had no idea that a customer wanted to pay twice. if the customer wanted to take a coin out of a slot and put it back in, the salesman could do that; but if the customer wanted to keep the coin, he would need to ask the customer. with the whole sales process, including coin-removal, salesman-interpreting, and asking customers to pay twice, the salesman had spent the best part of ten hours explaining that it was not possible to get fifty cents in a store with a four-dollar bill. the salesman had spent the best part of ten hours explaining that it was not possible to get fifty cents in a store with a five-dollar bill. even if the customer wanted to walk right up to the cashier and ask her to take the coin out of the register, it would still be impossible to get a fifty-cent ball in a vending machine.some retailers refuse to accept credit cards, and some even require customers to present their hand-held devices. the big three national retailers do not allow devices larger than standard card widths in their stores, and the honda and latters refuse. honda and latters announced in march 2009 that they would ""re-examine"" their coin-operated machines, and honda and latters reiterated these commitments in april 2009. in september 2009, the us department of justice  the american technology corporation, the countrys largest retailer, said that it would phase out the use of coin-operated machines by the end of 2009.the vending machines industry in south africa was a catalyst for the 2009 tel aviv conference. south africas vending machine manufacturer, edwin companies, stated that their machines had been the first to sell e-cigarettes that contain nicotine. the vending machines at the conference were launched by the company maufuku. edwin is a subsidiary of the companys south african armys subsidiary, maufuku. the company maufuku manufactures vending machines that are sold in pharmacies and convenience stores. in july 2018, the company announced that it would be relaunching the vending machine line in south africa.in 2012, the vending machine market in south africa was estimated at us$2 billion. in 2017, the trade was valued at us$4 billion. in 2018, the trade was valued at us$1.5 billion.in june 2013, the startup company turkish vending machine inc. was established in the uk with the objective of entering the vending machine market. the company is based in dublin and had raised $1 million in funding from valar ventures, amazon, and philimore. the company was also purchased by the british company betchery.though the company is no longer in operation, the vending machine brand is used on the packaging of some cigarettes. cigarette vending machines have been operating in the uk since 2012, in some form.the vending machine brand has been a source of ongoing controversy in the united states, where it has been linked to cigarette smoking and obesity. the company has been offered millions of dollars in incentives by cigarette companies, but has declined them. in july 2014, the company plans to re-enter the uk market.in 2017, the company opened a retail location at ackerman park in north carolina.in december 2017, the company opened a second outlet at the triple d in north carolina.in june 2018, carter island, a small island in the atlantic ocean, was the first of the 50 united states to open a vending machine outlet.the company hopes to establish a presence in other countries. in january 2019, the company opened its first south african store at a mall in johannesburg, south africa. the first two outlets are at the north end of the island.the company has launched some vending machine flavors in japan, as well.on december 3, 2018, it was announced that an american company called i-cigarette has entered into a partnership with the british supermarket chain colcannon to market the flavors of the i-cigarette. the company is also working with other american and british supermarket chains including amys, amys super, and food, and is planning to expand to other countries in the future.the company is headquartered in the united kingdom and is owned by british sovereign wealth fund. its headquarters is in north london, united kingdom",0,1
".4% of the worlds fisheries are estimated to be at risk from overfishing. a range of measures have been proposed to mitigate the impacts of overfishing but they are not mutually exclusive. the proposed measures include the use of artificial selection systems and the development of predator-prey systems. by altering the behavior of fish, primarily by reducing the number of fish reaching the surface, there has been a recent increase in the effectiveness of some fishery practices. however, the net effect of these changes has been that fish are caught in less and far with greater frequency in recent years than in the past. the number of fish captured with nets has increased, and the total amount of fish caught by nets has decreased significantly in the past two decades.fishery practices have become increasingly dependent on artificial selection systems that reduce the number of fish that can survive. these practices have been found to have adverse effects on fish welfare, such that fish that survived were often not maintained, and were instead discarded without being caught again. fish are also caught in conventional ways, without being manually caught, trapped, or released into the wild.fishery management differs from other major industries in that the fishery is a social activity that has a positive effect on the community. this is because fishermen use their knowledge of fishing techniques to help inform decisions that improve the welfare of fish. the fish are harvested as part of a commercial activity that has other workers as well as the fisherman who bought the fish. the profit is made by the processors who sell the fish in the marketplace. there is a social aspect to fisheries because of the material used in processing and the work of fishery management. these techniques are necessary for fisheries to function. fish are often caught in dangerous places such as the shallower waters of the atlantic ocean, off the coast of brazil, and on the coast of peru.fishery is a fairly widespread term across the world. it is a major industry in itself, with over 450 million fish caught in 2000. fisheries are an important source of revenue for many nations. many fishing communities maintain fishing vessels that are out at sea catching fish. some fishermen use nets and trawls to capture fish, but most fishermen use nets and trawls only as a last resort, catching fish that cannot be caught on land. in this way, fish are typically caught in a sustainable way, so that they can be released back into the wild, for example by raising fish in captivity. as a last resort, fishermen use nets and trawls but there are also fishermen who ""free-catch"" fish by targeting specific fish species that are commercially important. this practice is done to a certain extent, but not always, by anglers who attempt to free-fish. in this method, fish are caught in the wild and released into the wild.fishery is a complex industry that is subject to many laws and regulations. trout fishing is classed as a very large sport, which attracts many anglers from all over the world. commercial fishing is also a very large sport, attracting many anglers from many countries. fishing regulations vary widely between countries, reflecting a wide variety of fishing practices, the intended use of the vessel, and the species being caught. a fishing license is required of all anglers. the license fee is usually set by the fishing authorities to pay for fish that are caught legally, i.e., in a seasonally fishing area, and according to the fishing regulations, anglers are required to wear brightly coloured clothing at all times, both in the vicinity of the boat and in the open ocean. fishing licenses are also required of tourists fishing in waters near populated beaches; this includes atolls, rocks, and coral reefs. fishing off the coast of peru, on the other hand, is usually free and open to the public.fish are caught at the ocean surface by nets that are either placed to catch the fish or to help build the nets. these nets are called ""seals"" because they are on land only and are made by digging a hole deeper than about 2 metres  once selvedge is dead, leaves fall out. the net is closed and the fish escapes. this is called catching fish. some fish escape when they are caught by nets, while other fish  the net is placed over the angling rod and rod end.in a traditional fishing village, the fishing rod is first used to feed the fish. the fish are then taken by the fishermen to the cabin, where they are cleaned and washed, then cooked. the fish may be eaten raw or cooked into a dish that may be eaten. in a restaurant setting, the fish may be cooked into a meal.fish are also cleaned and washed again before being released into the wild, sometimes thousands of fish are caught in a single day. fish are typically stunned and killed after being caught, or they may be released back into the wild where they are hunted. fish are also hunted in this way in the wild by humans for meat or for trophies.the term for a fish that",0,1

"vessel bezoss theory of mind describes how a person can acquire what he calls ""mental attitude"". the latter term describes a person who is able to acquire attitudes of non-reactive or non-judgmental high regard, non-judgmental respect, and non-judgmental indifference toward others.  in essence, people who are able to acquire attitude would be saying they are moral, ethical, or skeptical. the ability to affect attitudes is said to be ""socially innate"" or ""dynamic"" and is considered a precondition for competence in various social situations. the cognitive brain is the seat of cognition, which is defined as the cognitive processes that occuruate with mental states, and are not exclusively or primarily external to the individual.mental attitude is a specific type of attitude. attitudes are generally classified as positive, negative, or neutral, depending on the context. in the positive attitude, a person expresses approval or disapproval of a situation, and is willing to change or adapt the way that a situation is handled so as to improve its outcome. negative attitude, on the other hand, describes feelings of discomfort or discomfort in the presence of a situation, and is characterized by a person not wanting to confront or modify the situation in order to resolve it in a positive way.in everyday life, people often differ in their attitudes towards various situations. for example, many people may express a negative attitude towards immigration, or a desire to deport illegal immigrants.some attitudes are acquired through experience. positive attitudes are ones that are self-understanding, and are formed from habits of thought, action, and behavior. negative attitudes are ones that are external to the person and are formed by internal dialogues.for example, many people dislike being told what to do by their spouse, parent, or other authority figure.people with autism have difficulty with attributing their problems, and attribution is a difficult skill for people with those disorders to master. for example, children with autism may have difficulty with attribution of their problems, whereas those on the autism spectrum may have great difficulty. negative attitudes are ones that a person expresses to others or to themselves, such as annoyance, disapproval, or disgust.for a list of mental attitudes, see this article.philosophers have debated the nature of knowledge and knowledge-making for quite some time, whether in the abstract sense of the word ""knowledge"" or in the sense of ""observation"", ""objecting"" and ""objecting"". on the other hand, malthus argued that knowledge is neutral, and knowledge-making is the agent by which the agent learns what to do. some view knowledge-making as an act, while others view it as a skill, or a faculty, acquired through observation and experience.several models have been proposed to explain the phenomenon. the model that has received the most research is the ""rat model of knowledge"", based on research by jeremy bentham. this model suggests that knowledge arises from the intersection between the agents interest and the agents interest. the agent is interested in learning how to move faster, so the agent takes the path that is most convenient. this is generally the same as the agent would learn from observing the path the agent would follow if he/she were not in the same situation.experience with knowledge-making often leads to the agents expressing knowledge. this is sometimes referred to as ""seeing-the-self"" or ""seeing-another-self"". an example of self-expression is the agent expressing knowledge about a subject to the environment through non-verbal communication.the use of non-verbal communication is sometimes referred to as ""seeing-others"", ""seeing-self"", ""seeing-self"" and ""seeing-others"". non-verbal communication is a means of signalling to others or a means of communicating onesself. non-verbal communication includes words, phrases, facial expressions, body language, gestures, and voice communication. the awareness of an agent of a potential threat allows the agent to approach the threat and avoid it.by contrast, the word ""knowing"" is a more specific, and more technical, term that is more often associated with physical or sensory awareness. ""knowing"" refers to the level of awareness, not the content of awareness. the word ""awareness"" which is most often used in academic discourse refers to the ability to articulate, express, or understand oneself.according to this definition, knowing ""someone"" refers to a person the agent is interacting with via words, thoughts, or actions.

"a free-spinning spinning wheel was invented by the american engineer j. w. hale in 1869. the wheel consists of a flattened cone, each side of which is spinning by a different mechanism. the spinning mechanism consists of a cylinder, a handlebars are bars that are placed against the wheels rim. the handlebars are made from a carbon fibre, a lightweight sponge, a plastic wrapped around the outside of the wheel. the sponge acts as a friction membrane, and is designed to deform to the shape of the wheel rim as the wheel spins. the plastic is also designed to be reusable, as is the case of the rubber bands used to secure the wheel to the handlebars. a combination of flat tyres and tyres with fins is used on the high-performance bikes.bike-cycles are used in many different purposes, such as:sustainable cycle use, the use of bicycles for local transport, cycling ergonomic and safety improvements, cycling safety and cycling etiquette. there are often more practical uses for bicycles, such as for:cycle exhaust is a term for the flow of air, or exhaust from a moving bicycle, over a distance  and the surrounding air, back towards the rider.cyclists are often compared with motor vehicles, including motorcycles, but this distinction is not universally recognized. in some countries, such as australia, the comparison is often not at all possible, especially in the developed countries, where motor vehicles are still predominately used for travel.bicycles have been used as a means of transport for long periods of time. for example, the first paved bicycle route in europe was laid down in the 19th century. the first motor vehicle to be built was the german car 1/2 in 1901.since the beginning of civilization, humans have used bicycles as a means of transport. they have been used for long-distance travel, and are commonly used for that purpose in developing countries such as china, india, and the philippines. many bicycle manufacturers set up shop in these countries as well, so that the bicycle is usually owned by urban dwellers, rather than the tourist, who usually needs a bicycle for a taxi or for errands.bicycles are often considered a ""taxicab of the first type"" because of their ability to carry passengers safely across city streets. though, the perceived ""safety"" of bicycles is generally a subjective matter, and many bicycle-mounted police departments around the world have been established to provide bike safety and protection.bicycles are commonly used for long-distance travel, and are often considered a ""taxicab of the first type"" because of their ability to carry passengers safely across city streets. though, the perception of ""safety"" of bicycles may be dependent on how far the bicycle is carried, both in terms of travel distance and time. for example, in the united states, the perception of bicyclists ""being easy to hit"" due to their size and speed is widely held to be false, while in china, the perception of ""being difficult to hit"" is common to both sides. a 2016 national survey in usa, conducted by the national bureau of economic research, showed that while bicycle use by young people is low compared to other travel modes, their bicycle-mounted transportation is high. young people who rode bicycles as their main mode of transportation were more likely to use them for trips within the commuting timeframe, and it was higher for trips within the commuting timeframe. they were also more likely to pick them up when they were parked far from the entrance to a vehicle, when they could be more easily exited. this is related to the fact that bicycles are more easily navigated by children and elderly, and also because of the greater safety of riding along bike paths.bicycles are often used by sport riders as transportation to and from rides to and from sports events.bicycles are used by skateboarders and roller skaters for travel from home.bicycles can be used to carry packages across city streets, and are often used by bikies.in british north america, bikes are often used by backpackers to transport non-food items such as small snacks, spare batteries for cellphones, and camera equipment.bicycles can be used to jump from place to place on smooth surfaces. in germany, bikers ride on bike paths to go from point to place on a city street on foot, while in france, bikers ride on the polished steel tracks to go from one end of the city to the other. in india, bikers use the bike path, which divides a city street into two parts, allowing them to cross the street on any part of the bike path.bicycles, being the most common type of roller-traxed transport in the world, can be safely travelled on any roads which have wide enough width to accommodate vehicles on both sides of the road. in the united states, wide-open spaces such as amtrak and amtrak route 10 are often",0,1

"ingrid matthias was the first ""modern"" to use a theme park to provide a theme park experience. the first theme park in the us was opened in 1960 in bloomberg, california. it was the worlds first theme park and was the first to be fully integrated with a theme park. the park also became the home of the bloomberg diamond club  the park hosted a number of notable sports teams, including the bright green i. the park was closed down in 1984 after two years. in 1995, the bloomberg diamond club purchased the land and the name ""muse"" was introduced. the new theme park was officially renamed the ""ingrid matthias land park"" in 2001.museland was a theme park in california that included a variety of rides, attractions, and restaurants. it sat adjacent to the santa monica bay seawall and was built directly next to the santa monica bay seawall. numerous local businesses were built within the park, including a barbershop, a bicycle shop, a hardware store, and a coffee shop. the local zoo, nestor, california-based jigsaw entertainment company, and two amusement parks  the parks popularity, which lasted for over a decade, was largely fueled by the hard-charging and aggressive marketing tactics that were common to all the major theme parks. in the early 1990s, the struggling theme parks in the united states  the strategy, however, proved unprofitable as attendance declined and financial pressures mounted. this eventually led to the closure of muse and the rebranding of the company as theme park operator greenwood entertainment. the original company name was changed to the theme parks internationally.the original theme parks, muse and nurture, were the product of careful planning and extensive planning. conceived in 1960 as a single package, nurture opened in 1969, just in time for the fall crop planting. with a focus on family fun, its emphasis on family was meant to appeal to children, while the theme parks itself was designed with a more adult-oriented purpose. the parks were a joint venture between the uk government and the company, with a joint investment by the uk government providing the cash to pay for the development of the parks. the first museums were located close to the beach, and were often family-oriented, while the rest were closer to the city centre. the first amusement park in the us opened in 1969, in bloomberg, california. the parks also had a distinctly british feel, with attractions centred on fishing and adventure. its success was due in part, to the combination of the large number of cloverbee fish that lived in the same area and the absence of traditional adventure games in the area. the park also featured games such as billiards and table tennis, among other sports.museums merged into one huge green complex in the 1970s. the older, traditional theme parks continued to exist alongside the newer, contemporary theme parks, while the original theme parks were shut down and converted into family fun parks. this was also done to provide space for new family entertainment. the merger of nurture and the new family entertainment company enticed many families to stay in the old facilities, but it also forced the older, traditional parks to close. the result was a huge reduction in park space, many of which was converted into shopping centres, restaurants, and hotels. the closings were a major factor in the 1993 chain mall syndrome. the parks also had large amounts of space for concerts and other music events. the closing of the old parks and their themed areas attracted a younger demographic, causing problems with accessibility issues for older children. the closure of the original parks in the us and ireland also contributed to the decline in attendance at the newer parks.the msa acquired the moniker ""the land of the lakers"" from an earlier park, the santa monica golf club, which went bankrupt in the mid-1970s and was replaced by msan g000, a new lifeline was built across the street from the convention center. a huge interactive bridge brought cars to the convention center from the santa monica golf club. the bridge also brought many new visitors to the convention center, bringing it up to 4 levels to accommodate automobiles. the bridge also lowered the pedestrian mall, allowing cars to enter the mall from the road. the bridge also replaced the convention center concert hall, making it one of the largest in the city. this bridge also served as the convention centers main entrance. the ""golf course"" also had a small amusement park built inside the course called ""the village"". the course also had a mini golf course built on the same site. the ""golf course"" also had a barbecues. the santa monica golf club also had a small amusement park built inside the course called ""the village"". this park also had a mini golf course built on the same site. at one point, the santa monica golf club even had an airport. the walt dis",0,1

wikimedia commons, neuroscience is the branch of biology that studies the mechanisms and physical properties of the brain. it is the branch of biology that has been most concerned with since the first organisms emerged. the term neurology is also sometimes used to refer to the branch of biology that studies neurology as a whole, although historically the term neurology was used primarily to refer to the medical sub-discipline of neurology, which is distinct from the rest of the medical sciences. in addition to the neurological sciences, neurology deals with consciousness and consciousness-related phenomena such as neural pathways, the brain stem, motor neurons, and various kinds of connective tissue. neuroscientists generally focus on the mechanisms by which consciousness and consciousness-related phenomena are produced, understood, and realized by individual humans, and on the problems of consciousness and its associated phenomena, such as the search for meaning and meaning in the world, or the existence of an afterlife. the understanding of consciousness and its related phenomena are of crucial importance to humanitys understanding of itself and future human society.the brain is the most complex organ of the body, with many functions that it performs. it is also the most complex organ of the human body, capable of performing many different tasks and fulfilling many different roles. when compared to other organs, the brain is equipped with a wide range of cranial nerves, more powerful synapses, and a large number of pathways that connect it with the rest of the body. a brain neuron is a small area of the brain responsible for synaptogenesis. this means that it can learn from its environment and adapt its behavior to the changing conditions it encounters. this adaptability is one of the hallmarks of all living organisms. the brain is also a self-organizing machine that continually learns from its environment. the brain stem is the part of the brain responsible for controlling impulses and information flow through the brain to the muscles and other parts of the body. the cerebellum is the main part of the brain responsible for the structure and function of the cortex, a large area of interconnected nerve endings that forms a large area of the brain. the cerebellum is divided into two parts, the right hemisphere and the left hemisphere. the cerebellum can be divided into two hemispheres, one for each hemisphere: the right hemisphere is larger than the left, with a larger number of lobes.the brain consists of three main parts, the right and left hemispheres:the brain is divided into an atrium, ventricularis, and linguale. the atrium is divided into the left frontal lobe and the cerebellum. the linguale is divided into the right temporal lobe and the cerebellum. the atrium and linguale are collectively known as the cerebellum.the brain is commonly thought of as consisting of three main parts, namely the right and left hemispheres, the right and left parietal lobes, and the left superior parietal lobes. the atrium and linguale are collectively known as the right frontal lobe and left posterior parietal lobe. the right and left frontal lobes are fused, and the right parietal lobe is missing. the area of the brain that is associated with the awareness of awareness, known as the right hemisphere, is often termed the sieve of the brain, or the right hemisphere of the brain. it has been proposed that the fusion of the right and left hemispheres in humans occurs at the sieve of the brain, or the sieve of the brain, although this interpretation is not universally accepted.a complex example that uses the sieve of the brain is the human brain, a modern version of the first reported human being, which was discovered in 1871 by the german scientist johannes k0th century.the sieve of the brain is divided into the right and left hemispheres and back to the middle, but the relationship between the middle and back is not as clear. in the early 1960s, it was proposed that the right hemisphere was always in an unspecific location, the left hemisphere was always with specific location, and the brain could have a ""center"" region that was always present. the brain, as viewed from different perspectives, is divided into two hemispheres. the left hemisphere is associated with specific functions, such as planning or learning. the right hemisphere is associated with more general, less conceptual skills, and the associated functions are carried on in both hemispheres. the brain is relatively modular, and is affected by the environment, rather than just by one hemisphere at a time.developmental neuroscience studies the structural neuroimaging of brain development and brain

"salt, which is now common in many parts of the world, was originally used as a mild disinfectant for personal use, being highly flammable and irritating to the skin. it was not until the eighteenth century that the use of it for purposes other than disinfection2, a chemical reaction that produces sulfuric acid, the first chemically stable form of the disinfectant, was identified by jean-paul moravec, one of the founders of modern chemistry.sulfuric acid has a number of salts that have a number of nitrogen atoms in the solid, which is a key characteristic of sulfuric acid sulfone. the most stable salt is called p-sulfoxide, which is chemically similar to sulfinone. p-sulfoxide is also the main intermediate in the synthesis of sulfuric acid sulfone.sulfuric acid sulfone is a base-alkaline sulfone, which can be used as a base in the synthesis of a number of other salts. the predominant sulfuric acid is sulfinone, which is formed by sulfite decomposition of iron and oxygen. the sulfinone-sulfuric acid decomposition is the major factor in the chemical identity of sulfites. sulfites are formed by the decomposition of sulfuric acid sulfone with the co2 produced by sulfur-oxidation. sulfites can be distinguished from sulfites by the presence or absence of a sulfidation product, an oxidizer that is also a sulfuric acid sulfone. the presence of a sulfidation product makes sulfide salt, which is chemically similar to sulfite, a minor salt. if sulfide salt is added at the end of the reaction, the co2 produced by sulfide decomposition is oxidized to sulfuric acid sulfone. the sulfide is converted to sulfoxide by the sulfuric acid sulfoxidation reaction.sulfuric acid sulfone is a base-alkaline sulfone, which can be used as a base in the synthesis of a number of other salts. the major salt is p-sulfoxide, which is chemically similar to sulfite, a minor salt. p-sulfoxide is also the major salt in the synthesis of x-sulfoxide. x-sulfoxide is also a major salt in the synthesis of k-sulfoxide.the sulfuric acid sulfone is a mixture of iron and sulfuric acid sulfide. it is the major salt of sulfide salt. it has a number of salts that are similar to p-sulfoxide, but with different oxidizing products.sulfuric acid sulfone is a base-alkaline sulfone, which can be used as a base in the synthesis of a number of other salts. its major salt is p-sulfoxide, which has a similar oxidizing activity to sulfide salt but without the need for any other salt to be reduced.p-sulfoxide has a number of salts that are similar to k-sulfoxide, but with different oxidizing agents. p-sulfoxide is the major salt in the synthesis of x-sulfoxide.x-sulfoxide is the major salt in the synthesis of k-sulfoxide.by far the most important of all sulfide salts is p-bromide, a branched-chain salt of iron and oxygen, that is used as the base for the synthesis of nearly all other salts.p-bromide is a branched-chain salt of iron and oxygen that is used as the base for nearly all other salts.sulfuric acid sulfone is a branched-chain salt of iron and oxygen that is used as the base for nearly all other salts.sulfuric acid sulfone is a branched-chain salt of iron and oxygen that is used as the base for nearly all other salts.sulfuric acid sulfone is a branched-chain salt of iron and oxygen that is used as the base for nearly all other salts.italic acid is a branched-chain sulfide made from the ethyl group of indole. it is the most abundant sulfuric acid in the human body and is found in the human body, liver, lung, intestines, and skin.p-tertiary acid is a branched-chain sulfide made from the tertiary group of indole. it is the most abundant sulfuric acid in the human body and is found in the human body, liver, lung, intestines, and skin.brominated hydroxytoluene is a mixture of carbon dioxide and a liquid poison. when inhaled, the poisonous effect is similar to that of cyanide. it is used as a name for a substance that resembles this. it is not known how it is obtained, or if it is a hallucinogen. it is also not known how it affects humans.brazilian ayahuasca vine is believed to have medicinal properties,",0,1
"1961

julian jurgensen and his colleagues developed a program to assess the safety of a new generation of strategic communication methods, including mass media. they established that the media had not yet reached its full potential. the risk was that these methods would be misused by criminals or militarists, or used against civilians as a form of warfare. they proposed a new generation of strategic communication methods, one line of attack at a time. they presented their proposals at the 1961 berlin talks.the berlin talks began on 5 july 1961, at the university of berlin with a meeting of the berlin governments delegation and other interested parties. the main focus of the talks was on the problem of PR: in the previous two years, the united states and the central powers had spent millions of dollars on PR, with the british and french spending roughly four times that amount.the third country at the table was the soviet union, which had been developing its own strategic communication systems since the 1960s. the berlin government decided to spend us$100,000 per year for a year in exchange for the exclusive use of that countrys strategic communications network. the berlin governments said they would share the costs with the other participants, and the united states and central powers said they would share the costs with the central powers. the berlin delegates proposed a total of us$500,000 a year for the berlin governments to use strategic communication networks. the american delegation said that the purpose of the communication would be to strengthen friendship and cooperation between the united states and central power. the berlin delegation said that the purpose of the communication was to contribute to the joint planning and coordination of us actions in support of the us-central power alliance. the soviet delegation said that the purpose of the communication was to strengthen the central power alliance, to improve the central power alliance, and to provide the berlin governments with information on the intentions of us and central power leaders. the berlin delegation said that the central power alliance could contain the united states and central power, but not the other west  the berlin delegation said that the united states and central power would be best able to counter us and central power leaders.the berlin delegation said that the idea was that the united states and central power leaders would be the best able to respond to the united states and central power leaders, but that the berlin governments would have the least influence and ability to respond. the berlin government and the rest of the central powers would not be able to coordinate their actions with the united states and central power leaders. the berlin delegation said that the berlin governments would be able to provide the berlin governments with information on the intentions of us and central power leaders.the berlin delegation said that the communication would be managed by a central power in berlin, and that this central power would coordinate actions between the berlin governments.the berlin delegation said that the purpose of the communication would be to build a strategic and material relationship between the central powers and the united states and central power alliance.in the run up to the 1950 united states presidential election, the british and french governments were already preparing for war, and their preparations were based on events in europe and on the assumption that the us would attack south korea. the british and french governments had also begun to build up a large military presence in the area. the threat of us and central power intervention in the korean war had already been discussed in paris and the early 1950s.the original message was ""perhaps its time to split the atom"" and the accompanying text said that ""the splitting of the atom does not, in the main, concern us in the slightest"". the message was intended to convey the idea that ""two atomic bombs can destroy each other simply as the two aerial bombs did"", and that ""we could destroy both the enemy and all the peaceable nations"". according to american strategic policy memorandum number 15, the official message was that ""it is our hope that the two air-powerings of us and e-powerings of europe will soon be brought into play to effect peace in the arabian and muslim world"".the berlin government and the peoples army of berlin were created on 9 july 1947. the first berlin-based army was the berlin-based army.deutsche kommunikant gmbh of germany was established on 20 march 1948 as the first federal government agency with the task of providing administrative and material support to the berlin government. the other government departments and agencies were created later. the government of the reich was established on 18 july 1947, and the offices of the president and of the prime minister of the reich were established on 27 july 1947. the office of the chancellor was established on 1 january 1948 by the reichstag on the recommendation of the prg. the office of the president of the federal republic of germany was established on 3 july 1948",0,1
"""the moods of the audience are what make the show great.""  bernardi explains that the characters pleasure/pain can be influenced by the moods of the audience, and the characters pleasure/pain can be expressed in ways other than the way the characters pleasure/pain are feeling.  this is the first time that bernardi has described how the show is constructed. bernardis description neatly separates the work of the storytellers and the work of the audience: the work of the storytellers is the work of the audience. the work of the audience is the work of the storytellers. the work of the storytellers is the work of the audience. bernardis comparison of a story to the work of the storytellers is an important one, because the work of the storytellers is the work of the audience. in the case of the show, the work of the storytellers is the work of the audience. the work of the audience is the work of the storytellers. bernardis comparison between a story and the work of the audience is further strengthened by the fact that the work of the audience is the work of the storytellers. bernardis comparison between the work of the audience and the work of the storytellers is further strengthened by the fact that the work of the audience is the work of the storytellers. bernardis theory of the movement of the story is further developed in the next chapter.in a ramayana shapada, during the third act, the audience is asked to serve as the raivas in a game where the opposing team must capture the ball and a goal, and the goalposts are at fifty yards.  the raiva caste is created by the players, arranged so that the raiva player receives the ball on his first pass; the second pass is to the player who scored the most points, and the third pass is to the player who scored the least. the game is played between the acts of a game and a game, and the raiva player receives the ball in his first pass after the game. the raiva player then forwards the ball thirty yards to the nearest end and shoots it into the opponents goal.  these four passes are known collectively as the ""point pass"" and they are collectively called the ""shooter pass"". the point pass is then passed to the shooter, who fires it at the goalposts for a goal.the shooting pass is a form of the shapada game. the game of the shooting pass is played between acts of a game and a shapada game. the game is played between acts of a game and a shapada game. the players of the shapada game are called the point passers and the opponents are known as the shooters. the game starts with the passing of a ball back to the raiva player who shoots it at the goalposts. the ball may be shot from the raiva players position, or it may be shot by the holders of the point pass. the kick is the third pass; the kick is fired by the holder of the kick, and is aimed at the goal of the kicking team. the ball may also be kicked from the kicking team. a player who scores a goal and then takes a point pass is called a tikkur in puerto rico. a player who scores a goal and then makes a shooting or kicking pass is known as a cliva in puerto rico.a passing play is called activa in puerto rico. the game is played between acts of a game and a shapada game. the passing play is called activa activa in puerto rico. the game is played between activa acts and goal-line technology is used to measure if the ball has crossed the goal. the technology is also used to calculate if the ball has touched the post or if the ball is still in the air. a passing play is called activa when the ball is played over the top of the opponents back four, or vice versa. the game is played on net with the ball called as ""pitcher"" and the goal called as ""ball"" in cases where the ball is played as part of a three-pass set. in the case of the three-pass set, the ball may be crossed only when the passing player is dropped to one side of the net.a passing play is called activa when the ball is played over the top of the opponents back four, or vice versa. the game is played on net with the ball called as ""pitcher"" and the goal called as ""ball"" in cases where the ball is played as part of a three-pass set. in the case of the three-pass set, the ball may be crossed only when the passing player is dropped to one side of the net.a goal is scored when the ball is sent through the opponents goal; the ball is touched by the goalkeeper to make a goal. the ball may not",0,1

"stebbins was working on a book about drug addiction when he met eric schlosser, a chemist, in chicago, in 1968. he had been studying the effects of heroin on the nervous and immune systems. schlosser was fascinated by the potential for heroin to treat or prevent many  other diseases associated with addiction are liver disease, heart disease, and elevated blood pressure. low blood pressure can lead to fainting and coma, and if left untreated can lead to death.there is a high fatality rate with heroin use, around 3.5% per 100,000 users. of all heroin users who die from overdosing on heroin, around one in ten die from a heroin overdose. of all heroin users who die from a heroin overdose, around one in ten die from a heroin overdose. of all heroin users who die from a suicide attempt, around one in ten die from a suicide attempt. of all people who die in an overdose, around one in ten die from a suicide attempt. of all people who die in a suicide attempt, around one in ten die from a suicide attempt.of all heroin users who die from a self-inflicted overdose, around one in ten die from a heroin overdose. of all heroin users who die from a suicide attempt, around one in ten die from a suicide attempt. of all suicide attempts, around one in ten die from a suicide attempt.of all heroin users who die from a self-inflicted overdose, around one in ten die from a heroin overdose. of all heroin users who die from a suicide attempt, around one in ten die from a suicide attempt. of all suicide attempts, around one in ten die from a suicide attempt.of all people who die from a drug overdose, around one in ten die from overdosing on a drug.of all people who die from a drug overdose, around one in ten die from a heroin overdose.of all heroin users who die from a suicide attempt, around one in ten die from a suicide attempt. of all suicide attempts, around one in ten die from a suicide attempt. of all suicide attempts that make it to the hospital, around one in ten die from a non-fatal overdose.of all drug overdoses, around one in ten die from accidental poisoning. for example, in a suicide note, a person may write that they had consumed a large amount of alcohol, took a drug which caused them to feel extremely uncomfortable, or ingested a new drug which caused them to feel uncomfortable. this could be due to side effects or other health concerns, such as anxiety.the time a person overdraws can vary from person to person. in the united states, the average person drinks about four shots of ernesto to dramatize the ernesto effect. in the 1980s the average person drank about four pills a day, on average. in the early 1900s the average person drank about thirteen to fifteen shots of ernesto to dramatize the ernesto effect. while the effects of alcohol on the human body are similar, the amount of weight gain is much greater. thus one can expect people to gain weight as a result of a heavy drinking habit, while it seems that the effects of alcohol on the body are more subtle.people who drink excessively tend to overeaten, while those who drink moderately tend to overeaten less. this is a subjective matter, and many factors can influence it. people who drink moderately tend to eat more than those who drink heavily, and vice versa. people who drink heavily tend to eat more than those who drink small amounts. this may be due to the fact that heavy drinkers have more access to alcohol in a given time, while the former drink less and consume it more slowly. people who drink small amounts of alcohol frequently tend to eat more than those who drink rarely, and vice versa.people who drink occasionally tend to drink less than those who drink infrequently. this is also a subjective matter, and many factors can influence it. binge drinking is associated with higher consumption, binge eating is the reverse of binge drinking, and drinking at regular intervals increases the risk of both binge eating and overeating.people who drink moderately or rarely generally do not report any negative health effects from excessive drinking. people who drink at excessive levels are more likely to experience lower body weight gain, a more significant reduction in cardiovascular disease, cognitive decline, and a faster aging rate.beverage is the popular form of alcohol, produced by the oxidation of starch in alcohols by the enzymatic reaction of sugar with acetic anhydride. the chemical processes underlying this reaction are somewhat controversial, and the degree and intensity of acetic anhydride in beverages vary among different craft spirits. the degree of final alcohol reduction by heat is a matter of some dispute, as some people reduce it to much alcohol reduction by water, others heat it to just enough to reduce it to alcohol by boiling, and still others reduce it to alcohol by vapourious ethyl alcohol. several other chemical reactions occur,",0,1

"thomas rogge, a professor of history and public policy at tufts university and author of the forthcoming theory of history, agrees with van gogh that history is a social science rather than a science, and that it is therefore somewhat different from science.history is the study of the way things change. it is a social science, different from science which is concerned with the physical world. it is also a social science, but not a scientific one, because the methods used in research are not based on scientific principles but on ""public relations and the media"", according to rogge. he argues that the terms ""history"" and ""science"" should be distinguished in their respective ways, and that the terms ""history"" and ""science"" should also be avoided.some scholars argue that, although it is sometimes argued that history is more accurately described as a social science, this is not always true. in particular, sociologist d.h. cox  in his book, through the eyes of history, cox shows how historians have often been skeptical of the concept of ""history"" itself.historians have often been skeptical of key aspects of the concept of ""natural law"" of the legitimacy of the legal systems that they created. for example, jeremy grimes  cox also argues that while historians may argue that the role of the state was originally modest, and the discussion of states to justify colonial expansion inevitably included conflicts, the contemporary concept of ""state"" is a more recent invention that arose out of the revolutions of 17th century europe.the study of history, as much as other branches of british study of history, is also in part a study of societal institutions. the history of the state is studied at the university of cambridge. the primary institutions of society are the state religion and the state church. the history of the state is studied at a university of cambridge. the study of state religion has followed the same pattern as the history of the state.producing and consuming history is a form of consumption, which means that the consumption of the historical period is part of a series of events, which are all linked to the production of a particular cultural product in the modern world. this is a major form of media consumption, and a major aspect of the history of culture.historians have often been skeptical of attempts to understand the past. for example, david mann and anthony d. horowitz question the historical veracity of apa, the hindu chronicles, and the british past, as well as other sources. other scholars, such as elmer l. delt, have pointed to certain events being of social significance, such as the destruction of the frescos in the temple of the sun at delphi. other scholars, such as robert m. charlton, have argued that the events were largely symbolic. the destruction of the frescos was symbolic because it symbolized the overthrow of the polity, as the sun deity was represented by destruction in the new constitution of the republic of greece under theaetetus, a system of government in which the polity was replaced by a deity that neither the state nor the people believed in. the frescos were symbolic because they were a part of the polity. other scholars, such as robert m. charlton, have argued that the frescos were symbolic because they were part of the polity. the history of the nubian empire was written by chichul, the 29-year-old daughter of a chinese general who overthrew the nubians in the second non-chinese century. chichul chronicles the ways of the empire to a contemporary audience by showing the peacefulness and prosperity of the times. the book was translated into chinese by the chinese scholar wang bi, who also wrote the history of the empire  the book was also reprinted in 1934 by the chinese nationalist zhu wang.the study of history is one of the three major branches of british study of history, alongside geography and literature. the history of the 20th century has been characterized by three major philosophical trends that are integral to the study of history: empiricism, realism and relativism.in the 19th century, major events leading to the rise of history were: the discovery of new lands, such as the new world, the discovery of old lands, such as the western hemisphere, the first world war, the discovery of new languages, such as german and french, the advent of the great cultural revolutions, the unification of the church, and the industrial revolution. this was followed by the rise of modern institutions, such as the state and the university, which educated the elite and invented machines and technologies that enabled the rise of science and industry. this is the industrial revolution, which made possible the vast expansion of resources available to the industrial revolution.the disciplines of history and politics also contributed to the rise of history, although the study of history was not always pursued systematically.historians are anyone who studies",0,1
", a republican is someone who is loyal to the political principles of the republic for better than average life time, but has not elected to become a member of the republic. the word republic derives in part from the ancient greek word 0th century, ""republic"" was shortened from the earlier proto-iranian romanization of the word. the modern concept of a republic is, broadly, that of a government of state, in which the executive and legislative branches of government are separated by separation of powers, with the legislature and the judiciary composed of the two highest branches, and the executive and the judicial handling of domestic affairs. a state is distinguished from a monarchy, which is distinguished from a republic, which is distinguished from an hereditary monarchy or a hereditary monarchy.governments have historically been created in order to balance power between the various levels of government. in many societies, the institutional arrangements for the exercise of power are such that the state is the dominant power, or at least the dominant power in terms of the size of the state population, and the institutional arrangements for its effective exercise are such that the state is the dominant power in nominal terms as opposed to the size of the population. alliances between rulers and their political allies and enemies are common in most civilizations. the principle of alliances between rulers and their political allies, has been called the ""golden age of alliances"" by david parnas and david kolbert, and the ""ruler-client"" relationship by henry cake. in the past, alliances between rulers and their armies were considered as political instruments of the state, as they were between monarchs and the armies of a conquered state. the state sometimes worked with other states to form an alliance, but these were less common in developed nations. political friendships were also made through economic alliances between states, which was the basis of international trade, and so were no longer sufficient to create an open market economy. states also established diplomatic relationships with each other, through trade agreements and other state actions. the first recorded attempt by a state to establish diplomatic relations with another state was made by the british dynasty in 1639, with the first recorded treaty of friendship between a foreign power and a state being the treaty of ghent between the english and the british in 1648. the first officially recognized foreign embassies of the united states were established by the american republic of china in 1828 and the french in 1836.the power of kings and rulers to rule a country has often been questioned, and the difference between a ""republic"" and a ""democracy"" is often emphasized. the distinction between a ""republic"" and a ""democracy"" is often considered to depend on the nature of the political system being established. in many democratic nations, the term is used more expansively, including in some western nations, such as the united states, canada and new zealand, where the word ""democracy"" is more restricted.the term ""republic"" is generally used in its broadest sense, which means both a commonwealth and a government of commonwealths, as distinct from a monarchy or other form of government of commonwealth. the word ""republic"" also appears in the title of the 18th-century english dictionary of the english language, which is the first modern english-language source of common english words with any word in the english language. the adjective republic is an anglicization of the words royal, commonwealth and parliamentarian.the word ""republic"" descends from the latin reliquus, which means commonwealth or kingdom. the word republican is from the latin reliquus, meaning commonwealth. the word republican is the source of many words in the english language, such as royal, commonwealth and parliamentarian. the english word republican is also used for the continental european language, which uses the word republican as its word of the first origin, as does the dutch.the term republican can also be found in a variety of other words in the english language, such as the english chronicle, english literary world, english parliamentary world, english court of common pleas, english house of lords, english crown, english high commission, english parliamentary system, and english parliamentary system.the majority of english states adopted their own constitutional form of government between 1733 and 1783, although the duke of wellington had suggested a model comprising three distinct legislative assemblies, a parliament, a parliament of commonwealths and a sovereign.  the 1733 english statute book is divided into three sections, each from which derive their own names. the three sections of the model consist of a parliament of commonwealths, a parliament of assemblies, and a sovereign. each of these is named after its state, and in some cases the name of the state. the first state is the republic, which may be called either the commonwealth or the kingdom. the third state is the republic of england, which is also called the

"2007, and the conception and birth of the child tax credit. the child tax credit was announced at the american federation of parents congress on september 22, 2007. the credit is primarily based on the principle that parents can earn interest credits on the money they save at the end of each month, instead of the interest they pay on savings, that the government provides to the insured. the credit is paid at the end of each month based on the same repayment schedule as for ordinary income. the credit is, in effect, a tax refund minus expenses from the qualifying sources. the child tax credit was credited with increasing the number of childless workers from 35 million to 415,000 in 2007. the credit is the policy of the federal government of the united states to reduce poverty within the united states.the child labor movement has been an important issue in the context of the family and the law. the movement is generally concerned with the effects of child labor on workers in the home, and seeks to change current laws that are detrimental to the health and well-being of children. the movement argues that the current system of child labor is harmful to workers, who are effectively exploited and enslaved directly or indirectly by the system.child labor laws have changed over time and vary by country. in the united states, for example, the day care centers and daycamps that once dominated the american home are no longer common. today, most workers in the home are employed by employers in a variety of child-care settings. child care is often a crucial part of government programs such as the work allowances program, the earned income tax credit, and the work from home program.child care and the child labor movement are both welfare-state and benefit-state movements. the child labor movement, on the other hand, is concerned with the effects of child labor on workers.child-care centers and day-camps once dominated the american home. today, most parents work in non-parental roles, and the traditional role of the mother is the caretaker. while the mother is the main caretaker, the father often works in the home as an industrial job. many child care centers and day-camps are industrial-type facilities with a low percentage of employees, and many of the same problems exist in the actual practice: child labor, child labor safety, parental leave, parental leave, child care, and employment policies. there are also concerns about safety and health and the permanence of child-care conditions.in the united states, there are two types of child care: day care centers and daycamps. a ""day care center"" is a child who is placed with an adult caregiver on a temporary basis for a limited period of time, such as a daycare center, and the child attends the same school as the parent. a ""day care center"" may be referred to as a ""permanent nursery"" or ""permanent day care."" a ""day care center"" is also a child who is placed with an overnight care provider at the childs home, for example, a foster care facility or a day-care center. a ""day care center"" is also a child who is sheltered from home and away from other children, in a home. a ""day care center"" is, at least nominally, a ""permanent nursery.""a ""day care center"" is a child who is sheltered from home and away from other children, in a home. a ""day care center"" is also a child who is sheltered from home and away from other children, in a foster care facility or a day-care center.child care has become a recognized speciality of the united states. the federal bureau of labor statistics reports that the percentage of children in foster care, as of december 15, 2015, stood at 9.2 percent  in the year 2007, there were an estimated 3.7 million children in foster care in the united states. children in foster care have unique needs, such as having a mother or father who is not able to care for them. children in need of care have often been turned away by child protective services.the term ""day center"" was used in the 1940s and 50s to describe the facility for children with home-based on-site care. the term ""day center"" is now obsolete as of january 1, 2020, as of october 1, 2020, all children in these facilities are considered daycamps.worldwide there are seven million children in care and approximately 11 million children in the un residential care program. there are also around 4.2 million children in the international refugee movement with no home.the word ""day""  is a derivative of the ancient greek dionysus, according to the hebrew scholar th-holubel. dionysus is a ""day"", ""a half-day"", or ""a minute"", in latin dionysus, ""day-medium"", which is a name in aesops. in the ancient greek",0,1

""american"" is used as a nationalistic designation, usually spelled ""amer"" or ""americanization"", which refers to a development of national pride or patriotism. the phrase ""patriot"" refers to a person who takes part in politics, usually in a public role, who is considered part of a national community.

"d. c. meade and m. floyd, two political scientists who study the relationship between religion and politics, argue that ""religion has a special relationship with political power that is often at odds with the incentives faced by other economic actors."" according to this description, religion offers a shared destiny, a shared history, and a shared future. this shared destiny is ""generally impossible to destroy, even through military might.""religion and politics interact in a complex and ever-evolving way. there are many reasons why and how religions can influence politics. for example, many religions preach the importance of cooperation between people, such as with the concept of bacchanalia. the importance of religion in politics is demonstrated by the fact that the political classes of the united states are predominantly christian whereas the political classes of india are religiously divided.sociologist l. christopher stevenson describes four kinds of religions in his book the relationship between religion and politics:civilization and religion, the study of history, the study of religion and politics, and the study of religion and politics in the digital age. stevenson attributes religion to the ""recognition of the collective memory of a shared experience"" and the ""healing of wounds through ritual and myth.""religion scholar and political scientist stuart mcguire has written that, ""religion is the product of politics, not vice versa.""for example, according to religion scholar michael gaffney, ""if you look at the relationship between religion and politics, you also would not find a conflict there either. the anthropologist l. david mech in his book political religion and the rational persuasion, argues that the same relationship between religion and politics exists in all human societies and that ""beliefs are essential to political life, just as belief is essential to the way people live and the way politics is conducted.""marxism and the sociology of religion, considered first by industrialist marx and sociologist georg simmel, argues that religion is a product of modernity as well as the emergence of the modern state. merchants who have created a state for themselves also create a state for other people to use as a market for their wares. the sociologist thomas a. gunther, in his book why we love, argues that religion creates a positive feedback loop.the co-operative economic system that we have today was created by people who had nothing to do with any religion. they had a market in which anyone could set up a co-operative and sell products. they set up a church, a school, a funeral home, a community centre, and whatever other institutions they pleased. they did it so that people would have a chance to make profits for their co-operation. in modernity, the state is the product of religion.the study of the state and modernity, as well as the study of modern political ideology, are central to the discipline of political science. political science is the study of the interaction between politics and politics in all countries, in all historical periods, in all societies, and in the 21st century. many political scientists are engaged in the study of political science as a discipline.political science is a social science , the scottish constitution or the scottish commonwealth is a government of the united kingdom created by king charles i of england and king john james of scotland on 1 january 1666. its primary functions are providing for the common good by regulating the internal trade, and providing for the defence and general well-being of the kingdom and its people. the scottish crown is the monarchs exclusive power. the commonwealth also acts on behalf of the parliament of the united kingdom. the scottish government is the supreme legislative body of the united kingdom, administering many of the same functions as the monarchical government of the kingdom. it is the first government in the world to be entirely elected by the people.the term ""council of the crown""  is used to refer to the legislative body, the parliament of the united kingdom, which is a standing body of the parliament of great britain and the unelected parliament of scotland. the word ""the"" ""is an adjective, referring to the scottish flag, and ""the"" is a noun, referring to the indigenous people known as the scottish people, whose culture is still used by the rest of the british empire.the scottish government is the supreme legislative body of the united kingdom, administering many of the same functions as the monarchical government of the kingdom;

"incredibly, the size of the birds themselves is of little consequence to the individual birds. many, including kitten-signalling species, have been found to be as small as 80 to 133 millimetres the size of a kiwi is not very useful for navigation, so the birds are specialized in a different type of flight: the pteropodidae pteropus longirostris , the eagle is a member of the order pteridae, in the family pteridae, the smallest being the pteropus. the egyptian panthera tippelskirchis was the first bird to fly, and the earliest known bird. the earliest known hummingbird is the putumaya, which dates to the middle of the 17th century. the oriental gyrfalcon is believed to have been first flown in 1676. the putumaya was usually followed by the oriental rainbird, but the rainbird disappeared after the oriental gyrfalcon was captured. the caspian hummingbird is closely related to the oriental gyrfalcon, and evolved from it. the pteropodidae pteropus tippelskirchis was the first bird to fly, and the earliest known hummingbird. the putumaya was not alone in the eccentricities of its vocal repertoire: the other hummingbirds are named for their distinctive whistles.the pteropodidae pteropus tippelskirchis was the first bird to fly, and the earliest known hummingbird. it has been suggested that this pigeon was adapted to communicate using sounds made by whistling, rather than foraging for food. it has been suggested that the pteropodidae evolved from the oriental gyrfalcon. the pteropodidae is split into the two wild species, p. tippelskirchis and p. tippelskirchii, although these are not closely related to the extant hummingbird species.the commonwealth bird, or hawksbill, is the smallest hawk. it is also the only species of hawk that can be found nested within an egyptian royal burrowing spider nest. however, the hawksbill is not adapted to travel: it has a longer beak, a denser body plumage, and a longer beak-shaped tail than the pteropodidae. the pteropodidae are adapted to live in trees. the pteropsidae are also adapted to live in trees, being able to jump as far as they can and remain stable on the branches.birds have been adapted to live in trees. the pteropodidae can be found in trees, including in tree hollows and in tree trunks. the pteropodidae and the pteropodidae live in groups, known as flocks, in tree hollows. the pteropodidae are the only non-mammalian species adapted to live in tree trunks.the pteropodidae have been known to travel up to 14.5 metres  the most notable example of pteropodidae was the hummingbird, which was first captured by juan de la cierva in the 1850s. the hummingbird was not alone: other hummingbirds, such as the jaguar, panthera tippelskirchii and the basking shark, live in tree hollows as well. it is unclear whether the hummingbird evolved from the pteropodidae or whether it evolved separately, independently from the pteropodids, during the cretaceous period.the pteropodidae are considered to be close to being the sister genus to the pteropodidae, so a cladogram of pteropodidae is included in the present article. the genus pteropus is divided into several subfamilies. the non-mammalian pteropodidae are further divided into the two monotypic species: the jaguar and panthera tippelskirchii are monotypic, and the basking shark and the hummingbird are intristerotypic. a cladogram of pteropodidae is included in the present article.the pteropodidae are classified as cladontidae: they share a common ancestry with the pteropodidae. however, their anatomy is more like that of the pterostodidae. in addition, the pteropodidae share with the pterostodidae the same basal gene distribution.the pteropodidae are monophyletic or monophyletic with pteropodidae being sister clades to pteropodidae. the two monophyletic families are pteropus and pteropodinae . pteropodidae are divided into two clades, the jaguar and the panthera , and is the only species of hawk. the jaguar is",0,1

American chemist john williams invented the method of distillation in 1894. distillation is a method of heating, in a closed vessel, a solids solution of a substance to yield a product. the process of distillation is as follows:a complete distillation of a liquid is complete when the product is filtered out with a filter. the product is treated with heat and evaporated out of the vessel. the product is filtered and concentrated in a hot nitric acid solution. a mixture of sulfuric acid and water is heated to vaporization. the product is heated to vaporization until the sulfuric acid vaporizes and the water vapor is condensed to the liquid solution. this condensed product is cooled and is ready to be bottled.a complete distillation of a liquid produces a finished product. the distillation product is cooled and is ready to be bottled.a complete distillation of a liquid produces a finished product. the distillation product is cooled and is ready to be bottled.a distillation of a solid is complete when the product is filtered and a solution of the solid is saturated with a filter. the product is filtered and a solution of the saturated product is prepared to be distilled. the product is cooled and is prepared to be distilled.a complete distillation of a liquid is complete when the product is filtered and a solution of the liquid is saturated with a filter. the product is filtered and a solution of the saturated product is prepared for cationing. the cationing is complete when the product is filtered and a solution of the liquid is prepared for filtration. in the case of a solid, the solution is prepared for ionization. the ionization of the product removes the precipitate, ionization of the product, and finally the filtration of the solution. the filtration of the solution removes precipitate, ionization, and finally the removal of the filter. a complete distillation of a liquid is complete when the product is filtered and a solution of the liquid is saturated with a filter. a liquid is saturated with a filter only when the product is filtered and a solution of the liquid is saturated with a filter. a solid is saturated with a filter only when the product is filtered and a solution of the solid is prepared for ionization. the ionization of the product and the solution follows the same process. the product and solution are prepared for ionization.in the case of a solid the solution is prepared for ionization. the product and solution are removed from the liquid and the metal wicks that were used to filter the liquid are replaced by new metal ones. the new wicks are coated with nickel and then covered with conductive nickel foil. after this, the new liquid is purified by heating on an electric arc. this heating allows the new wicks to stick to the nickel and prevent them from separating. the heating stops when the new wick separates. in the case of a liquid, the separator is heated to remove the liquid. in the case of an electrolyte solution, the cathode is heated to remove the electrolyte. the heat of the cathode allows the atomic layer to heat up and provide a conducting surface for the new electrolyte, while the heat of the metal layer allows the liquid to conduct.in the case of a liquid, the electrolyte is heated to ionization. the product and solution are removed from the liquid and the new solution is prepared for ionization. the ionization of the product and the new solution removes contaminants and removes the ionization product. in the case of an electrolyte solution, the solution is heated to ionization. the product and solution are heated to ionization and finally the separation is achieved when the liquid reaches the temperature of the ionization product.the oil and water vapors that are left over from the distillation of the original liquid are heated to gas phase and the resulting gas phase is passed on to the heating coil. the heating coil passes the gas on to the heating element that is heating the liquid. the element is set to take this gas through a nozzle to the heating element and the nozzle passes the gas on to the heating coil. the heating coil passes the gas through the nozzle and the nozzle passes the gas on to the coil. this ensures that the liquid that is being heated is heated correctly. the gas phase is heated until it begins to vaporize and the liquid is taken through the nozzle to the heating element. as the vaporization proceeds, the heating coil is heated until the gas phase is completely heated and the liquid is taken through the nozzle to the heating element.wheels:wheels are used to help stabilize the liquid during the heating and cooling process. with the use of a wheel, the fluid will flow and condense onto the wheel. in the case of a wheel, the wheel is used to apply heat to the wheel. this results in a lubricated surface that provides improved grip and helps the wheel remain more stationary while the heat is heating and cooling the liquid.wheels are",0,1

in recent years, alternative medicine has become a growing field of science, with a rise in research methods and in the use of randomized controlled trials  a number of alternative medicine approaches have been developed, and most alternative medicine systems are based on specific principles: they may not be based on a particular model or theory, and they do not claim to be better than conventional medicine.alternative medicine has been used by the military, the national armed forces, and other large organizations in the treatment of a variety of different conditions, including cancer, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis. the term alternative medicine is used to describe medical treatments that are based on alternative medicine concepts, such as herbalism, homeopathy, naturopathy, and chiropractic care.alternative medicine is not a new field of science. it has existed since the beginning of medicine, and is practiced today by many ancient and modern medical practices. some of the most common alternative medicine practices include:the word ""alternative"" is derived from the ancient greek word 0th century.in the medical literature, several alternative medicine theories were proposed, including alternative medicine being based on observations of natural phenomena0th century, alexander peterson, a professor of medicine at the yale school of medicine, proposed a very simple, albeit controversial, theory: that vaccines are ineffective and that antibiotics should be replaced by alternative methods of treatment. his work was largely ignored by the medical community until he submitted his paper to the american journal of medicine in 1971.peterson believed that because no vaccines work, it is possible for a vaccine to be invented that works like a vaccine and is given to people every year instead. he also believed that because the immune system of humans is weak, a vaccine can be designed that works like a vaccine and given to people every year instead. alexander m. kastle, a professor of medicine at the yale school of medicine, proposed the following pseudoscientific rationale for vaccines: ""it is possible that in the future, i could have a vaccine that works like a vaccine and takes a few weeks to make. in the meantime, im keeping an eye on this.""  in 1983, the government of the united kingdom announced that it was paying a group of researchers $250,000 to carry out a study to determine the safety and effectiveness of a vaccine against measles, mumps, rubella  the study was largely ignored by the medical community, despite several authors having receiving payment for their participation.in 1987, the us public health service started a study looking into the use of a combined measles vaccine that had been developed with mumps vaccine. the us study found that the combined measles vaccine was highly effective in preventing mumps in the united states. despite high vaccine effectiveness rates, the us study did not find enough evidence to recommend the use of the combined measles vaccine, which was not to be expanded upon.the us mumps virus vaccine was also highly effective in preventing mumps in the united kingdom.a 1986 study found that, although a booster shot was generally more effective than a one-shot placebo, the effectiveness rate with the one-shot vaccine was significantly higher with one shot than with booster. a 1986 study found that the combined measles vaccine was less effective than the combined dm vaccine with one booster. a 1987 study found that the combined mumps vaccine was no more effective than the combined measles vaccine with one booster. a 1989 study showed that the combined mumps vaccine was no more effective than the combined dm vaccine with one booster.in 1993, the us preventive services taskforce reported that about 37% of children in the united states had been vaccinated with mumps-containing vaccine. of these, about 68% were unvaccinated, 24% were vaccinated with mumps-containing varicella vaccine, and about 16% were vaccinated with a chicken pox-containing vaccine.in the early 1990s, there was considerable concern that the mumps virus vaccine might be causing severe allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis. this was disputed shortly after the mumps virus vaccine was introduced; the concern was eventually resolved, as sheeps eggs and tissue were accidentally mixed with the vaccine, and this was corrected after the samples were subjected to a screening process to eliminate potentially susceptible sheep.the mumps virus vaccine is effective in reducing the risk of mumps in young people, although there",0,1

" had been published in the american journal of medicine, and the first american review of the effects of ernest n. alva  he was working on a book about the effects of a single high-dose iv combined with dietary restriction. within a few years, he was also working on a review of the effect of various diets on improving human performance. alva shared his initial conception of exercise as the primary subject matter in the early stages of clinical trials in the late 1920s, but in the course of writing of the book he realized that it could also be the primary subject matter in further studies.alva was at the center of a controversy in the late 1920s over the proposed use of exercise as a treatment for low blood pressure. the relationship between hypertension and exercise prompted public and congressional criticism of the drug. alva was widely criticized for failing to communicate his conclusions adequately to the public, and he faced pressure to grant the request for a grant of some $25,000. he decided to give the money to the national institute of health. the first grant went to the university of massachusetts, which operated a medical campus and a research laboratory for exercise research. the university of massachusetts managed-care and clinical training program funded the program.the penny-pinching approach of the time was not lost. in 1923 john willer, director of the pennsylvania athletic clubs program, sponsored a 30-person summer program at the university of philly. these were the first Pennsylvanian to sponsor an athletic program. the summer program was based at the pennsylvania state athletic club in fairmount, pennsylvania. willer and the pennsylvania athletic clubs staff were organized and staffed by former and current college and university coaches. willer also hired two summer basketball teams, coached by ex-nba players and current players.the first long-form study of exercise and hypertension published in the 1920s, by l. david mech in the journal of the american medical association, examined the relationship between hypertension and various physical activities. using this approach, mech proposed that exercise produce an increase in blood vessel blood flow. in a subsequent study, led by james e. hamilton, a professor in the department of kinesiology and cardiovascular physiology at the university of massachusetts medical center, forensic investigators demonstrated the effectiveness of exercise as a preventive measure against cardiovascular disease. in the present study, researchers from the department of kinesiology and cardiovascular physiology at the university of massachusetts medical center and the university of pennsylvania state the study was called the ""athleisure-activity"" hypothesis and found that the benefits of exercise were greater the more time people exercised. this was supported by a variety of evidence-based studies including race, age, gender, body-mass index, heart disease, smoking, and use of statins.in june 2009, a ten-year study found that exercising increases the number of postprandial blood clots in the blood. in a later study, researchers found that the benefits of exercise can last throughout the post-workout period. of the approximately 2,000 participants, almost all exercised for at least four hours. many participants exercised more than one hour at a time. in one exercise trial, participants exercised for eight hours and then practiced a seven-day recovery period. in the other trial, participants exercised for 10 hours and then practiced a ten-minute walk each day for two weeks. the trial also found that both groups performed better on cognitive tests of visuospatial orientation and attention. the studies support the notion that increased physical exercise can be a useful strategy for weight management.the benefits of exercise are recognized by the number of people who maintain a healthy weight, a healthier waistline, and reduced risk for cardiovascular diseases. however, the relationship between exercise and weight is controversial. a 2012 review found that although exercise does have beneficial effects for weight loss, weight loss is likely to be more successful if started before age 20. the benefits of increasing waist-to-hip ratio are better understood in this context because that ratio has been shown to be a predictor for weight-loss.the relationship between exercise and cardiovascular disease is less clear. a 2012 meta-analysis found that exercise does not increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases, but rather the risk of cardiovascular diseases is increased when compared with sedentary individuals. the meta-analysis was based on the hypertensive effect of exercise  a 2014 review found that moderate levels of musculoskeletal pain were an independent risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. the authors concluded that the hypertensive effect of exercise appears to be more likely an adaptive response to a severe stressor. however, a 2012 review had found that lower levels of metabolic rate, sleep, eating, and hormone levels are all independently affected by exercise.the relation between obesity and cardiovascular disease is less clear. a 2012 meta-analysis found that obesity is associated with an increased risk of heart disease, but the relationship between weight and heart disease is more

"stuart klein, a professor at the yale school of management, has argued that, ""the challenges of entrepreneurship are baked in the DNA of human beings. it makes sense that a business which provides an entity that provides a service to another entity should have its business value determined by the service provided."" according to klein, the reason entrepreneurs ""don_t_give_a_shit_about_your_self"" is because they do not ""give a shit about yours"".klein states that because entrepreneurs ""don_t give a shit about their customers"" and because ""they dont care about your business or the company"", the business cannot be considered an investment.according to the business practice known as ""creative accounting"", an entrepreneur hopes to generate positive returns by maximizing net income from the business. this may involve minimizing expenses, maximizing the return, or maximizing the net income. the entrepreneur assumes risk, such as investing while operating a business. the risk is calculated according to the entrepreneurial risk model. profit from the business is assumed to be zero, which means there is no risk involved. the entrepreneur can, therefore, use the accounting principles to generate positive earnings.the term ""irrational exuberance"" was first used by the great ape raisinius in the 19th century to describe the excitement and rush that entrepreneurs felt upon discovering a new product or service. entrepreneurs are said to ""run wild with their emotions"" and are said to ""play with fire"".exuberance is a state of mind characterized by excessive consumption, lack of reflection on activities of daily living, and the absence of meaningful work or other concerns. exuberance is often associated with seeking out new experiences and situations, while avoiding mundane concerns. exuberance is a common trait of young people, but can also be found in old people, who engage in repetitive or inattentive behaviours in order to occupy their minds with excitement or entertainment.exuberance is a state of mind characterized by excessive consumption, lack of reflection on activities of daily living, and the absence of meaningful work or other concerns. exuberance is a common trait of young people, but can also be found in old people, who engage in repetitive or inattentive behaviours in order to occupy their minds with excitement or entertainment. the former description fits well with several observations about exuberance and anxiety, such as that excessive exuberance can lead to anxiety, irritability, and worry. this is contrasted with the former description of a person who is engaged in a productive activity and who does not indulge their emotions. the former description fits well with several observations about the mind and its functioning, such as that each day brings new opportunities for developing and testing new ideas and that work is sustained by the existence of work-associated work-life balance.exuberance is a state of mind characterized by excessive consumption, low self-awareness, and an inability to be considered an active participant in the temporal distribution of the wealth created by one who engages in ""creative"" activity. the term ""irrational exuberance"" was also used by l.e.b. brucell, one of the founders of the theory of irrational exuberance, to describe the state of mind of an individuals rational exuberance. the irrational exuberance theory posits that people who are not engaged in creative activities are not generating wealth and that the goal of generating wealth is not productive activity. this gives rise to the theory that the resources created by one who is not creative are not being used effectively. according to brucell, people who are not creative are not using their resources effectively because they are not using the resources effectively.the irrational exuberance theory was inspired by the experience of ronald coase, a chemist who had discovered chemical elements in water and who had been leading the effort to prove that the chemical forces in the elements were the product of random chemical reactions rather than the result of a process that had a specific beginning and ended at a predetermined point in time. coase was making the argument that because wealth is the product of productive activity, one should assume that the same productive activity is going to be used to generate wealth. according to brucell, this applies to the use of one sows seed to fertilize a field of grain and to the plant being left to recover its nutrients. if the sows is left to use its resources to fend off other predators, it is not productive; so it must be assumed that the same resources are not being used to fend off predators. according to brucell, this also applies to the use of one sheep to pull a cart. if the sheep is left to do this, it must also be assumed that it is not being used to pull the cart. this, combined with the fact that livestock are not used to pulling a cart, implies that the same resources are not being used to pull the cart. thus, brucell concluded that sheep are not simply passive consumers of the resources in their surroundings, but actively participate in the resources being used by their sheep.in",0,1

"heid jansen wrote ""the story of the great man"". it was first published in 1891 as part of jansenists training, and was adapted into the 1937 film the great career. jansen was one of the founders of the zulu language.the zulu word ""man""  zulu is a colloquial term for a person of any nationality, who may be of any sex, and who derives his or her identity from the fact that they are a member of a racial, ethnic or religious minority group. the term ""race""  in american english, it is sometimes used as a derogatory term for black or asian people. the term is also commonly associated with physical, or mental retardation, and is also sometimes used to describe ones own race. the term is most often employed in western society in racial and ethnic conflict, where it can be used to dismiss or disparage a racial or ethnic group, as well as a nationality.the first documented use of the term ""race""  the term has been used in the context of social and political disagreement, especially in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, to describe social and cultural differences, often used to describe physical differences between peoples, or differences in the number of white people on earth, and to describe biological differences between peoples. the term has been used in racial and ethnic discourse since at least the ancient greeks.in the history of ideas, there have been many debates about the nature of races. some movements have argued that all human beings are biologically the same and have been influenced by the same forces, while others have argued that some human beings are genetically distinct and have been influenced by those forces. in the modern era, the idea of race has arisen in response to the questions about genetic inheritance and the role of race in the transmission of human culture.the origins of the term race can be traced back to the ancient greeks. alexander the great, one of the greatest men of his time, was of a questionable tradition. his concept of race was often in tension with his concept of civilization, which saw both races as destructive to progress. it has been argued that, while race was important in ancient greece, it became a hindrance to progress and was therefore not essential in a democratic society. the ancient greek idea of race was not replaced by the modern concept of race, which remains the guiding light of western civilization.racism, as the new concept of the world beyond the ethnic divide, was born. the term emerged from the revolutions of the ancient greeks, who insisted that aryan supremacy or the ""white race"" was a myth. they argued that the white race, as the inheritors of the blood that has been spilled in european culture, was an aberration, a deviation from the natural order of the universe, a deviation from the moral order of the universe, and the source of all that is good in human society. they saw themselves as the ""white race"" descended from, and adapted to, the ""white race"" of ancient greece. they saw themselves as the progeny of the ""white race"", a progeny that, in the course of time, would sweep away all other national and racial groups. they believed themselves to be the ""white race"" because they were the progeny of the ""white race"". this conception of race was not contradictory to any other ideas that were around at the time. the concept of race was so widely accepted that, by the end of antiquity, most people considered themselves to be ""white"" even if they did not look like the majority majority of europeans who were not considered ""white"" in the sense of being ""white"" in the culture and society, and in fact, according to the romans, they were considered to be ""castes"" or ""aliens"" as the majority of people of the continent were also ""castes"".in the early 19th century, the racial ideology of the americans came to be seen as a natural extension of their national identity. for the first time in human history, racial categories were used to identify the society and the state of society.race was also used to identify people who were not considered white by europeans, ottomanis or russians. it was also used to identify people on the southern coast of spain who were not considered white by the majority of people on the island.race is also used by german people to identify people from non-white origins. in the same way, russian and baltic rachel are used to identify people who are not considered white.the term ""european"" is used to describe people of european ancestry. the term comes from the french and italian word 0th century, the term ""natives"" was used to describe people of native american ancestry. this term did not cover the european people, nor did it include the indigenous australians, nor did it include the inuit or lowland mexicans",0,1
"taoism and taoism studies include the study of  the various texts, the  british british cultural anthropologist robert frager relates that the british government ""took a keen interest in the development of east asian cultural politics and social institutions. a major concern was the role of the chinese in the development of british national identity,  the british government even created a chinese cultural department to focus on the development of the british cultural and social identity of british people. the united states had a relatively neutral view of chinese cultural influence, but it was on the rise in the communist east asian economic bloc. the british government was concerned that the influence of chinese cultural activities would be undermined in the event of war against namibia.the study of chinese history is a major academic field. it is also a recognized field of interest in the chinese language.taoism is a branch of taoism that emphasizes the study of the nature and behavior of the taoist system as a whole. the system itself is studied, its principles are developed, and its applications are emphasized throughout the teaching of the sutras and teachings from the various taoist schools. the study of taoism is closely related to the study of medicine, and, more specifically, to pharmacology.taoism is considered one of the ""three great historical currents of china that have had a profound influence on the cultural life of china and have significantly shaped the development of chinese society, politics, and culture for nearly three millennia""  as a cultural movement, taoism has entered into the global cultural conversation about topics as diverse as politics and philosophy, as well as the social and political history of china.taoism is recognized internationally as a distinct and central theme in chinese culture. it is one of the four major themes that characterize taoist thought. taoist thought is expressed through literature, and through the activities of taoist associations and schools, taoist schools of thought have a presence in many chinese cultural life. in the peoples republic of china, taoism is sometimes identified as a religion, and is sometimes included in the definition of the shangzu  in tibet, taoism is a major religious topic, as defined by the tibetan authorities.chinese taoism is a school of thought that emphasizes the concept of tao, or tao, as the path toward awakening. taoism is defined by its adherents as a system of philosophy, where tao is a way of life. its adherents are known as taoists, and there are a variety of schools of taoism. the taoist associations and schools are grouped into four groups: buddhist taoists, taoist buddhists, huanggushan taoists, and tangshiquan taoists.the buddhist taoists are buddhist monks who devote themselves to the teachings of buddha. buddhist taoism differs from buddhism in that buddhist taoists do not equate buddhist teachings with buddhist practice, and buddhist taoists do not venerate or follow the teachings of buddhist buddhas. the founder of buddhism, buddha, is described as a taoist, though buddhist monks who dedicate their lives to buddhism are not called buddhist taoists. the huanggushan taoists consider buddhist buddha to be a great buddha, a manifestation of buddha-like states. tangshiquan taoists regard buddhist tao as the manifestation of the great buddha, buddha-like states.the huanggushan taoists are han chinese buddhist monks who have dedicated their lives to buddha-like states. the taoist communities in china are known as buddhist taoist buddhist monastics, or buddhist taoist buddhist monk, and are recognized by the chinese communist party as the ""taoist order"". this order claims to uphold buddhist teachings, and has been called ""the most prominent and powerful force in the world promoting buddhism"".the tangshiquan taoists have been called ""the most powerful force promoting buddhist  buddhist monastics are freely chosen in the ""purest, purest, purest, purest"" way, and recognized by the central government as ""buddhist taoists""  in china, the ""four systems of taoist buddhism""  are recognized by the ministry of state cultural affairs and tourism as educational institutions offering taoist programs.there are four buddhist systems of taoism: buddhist, t",0,1
"thats not to say that the time of migration is necessarily the same for all modern humans, nor that the same rule applies to the same individuals or populations across time. for example, it is possible that homo erectus and homo erectus spread across asia between 18 million and 10 million years ago, followed by archaic homo in east asia between 13 million and 8 million years ago, and archaic homo in south asia between 9 million and 7 million years ago. it is possible also that modern humans spread westwards into asia between 6 million and 3 million years ago.the spread of the modern human species may have started with homo erectus, which is thought to have spread from west to east, by expanding along what is now julyan corridor. the modern human species may have spread westwards again beginning about 5 million years ago, between the last glacial period and the last glacial maximum.the earliest modern humans to spread westwards were the homo erectus or Homo neanderthalensis, who spread along with early modern humans into sub-saharan africa and west to south asia, and then east to south america. the homo neanderthalensis spread westwards into asia, including mongolia, southeast asia, china, and thailand, while the early modern humans spread into the indian subcontinent, china, north korea, and armenia, and then moved west into east and southeast asia.the earliest known written accounts of people migrating from east to west can be found in the migration of the nubians in the 6th century, the nubians traveled east to kaffa, a town in the sack of samarkand, to escape the muslims who had taken over the city. they contacted the mongolian sultans and were permitted to cross the red river into somalia. the sultans invited the mongolian mesti to dwell in somalia, but the mesti refused; he resettled in north kaffa. the sultans sent a fleet to confront the mesti at obokan, but the mesti quickly defeated the invaders, bringing obokan back under muslim control.the mongolian empire controlled most of the balkans, with the vikings and the hussars also occupying the balkan peninsula. the erasmus diaspora continued into the middle ages, with the first europeans to reach the balkans reaching spain in 1066. the erasmus continued to control the balkans, annexing their eastern territories and dominating them in the south, which eventually gave the sultans the necessary territorial access to the balkans. the erasmus were the last major european empire to fall by the wayside.the mongol empire was the dominant power in europe from the 15th century to the 19th century. it held the southern borders of the balkan peninsula, the mongolia region, and the two major rivers, the amur and the amur, as well as the mouth of the danube. in 1871, a small tatar population moved into what is now belarus, which became the new capital of the soviet union, ukraine.this is the one of the most historically dynastic states in the world, as the republic of belarus and the independent states of kosovo, serbia, albania, the balkans in the soviet union are the main geopolitical units. a central authority with significant administrative control over the area and its nomadic peoples, the peoples militia  the people of the former republic of belarus, the republic of serbia, the republic of albania, the republic of japan, and the republic of the vojvodina had no common political system until the late 19th century, when this power was shared through the federal commission for the unification of the soviet union.belarusian president ernst nzapimukhina and belarusian president masta kisena in 1872 proposed the idea of a federation that would have encompassed the whole of eurasia. the federal commission for the unification of the soviet union held a series of meetings, and the final decision was made in jerzy neyman ivs republic of serbia in 1884.following the first soviet winter olympics in 1924, the soviet union was the first western country to host a major race, the 1936 berlin games. the federation of the independent states of kosovo and serbia held the winter olympics that year.the united states of america established the nation of archangel, a tax-exempt organization for children of the united states, in 1948. the organization exists to promote sports and educational opportunities for children of the united states.in the united kingdom, the united kingdom is the chief sporting nation",0,1

"e-cigarettes were originally conceived as a nicotine replacement, but in 2015, the united states food and drug administration stated that e-cigarettes are likely to be future-proofed to provide a longer-lasting nicotine replacement, without risk of long-term harm to users.e-cigarette companies have developed a range of flavors and models, all designed to be used with a battery-powered heating element. many of these have been designed for use with e-liquid, and others have been designed for use with conventional cigarettes. some have been manufactured to be smoked in public places, while others have been manufactured for smoking with e-cigarettes, or for use with traditional cigarettes. e-cigarette companies do not plan to make e-cigarettes a viable nicotine replacement for smoking traditional cigarettes.the e-cigarette industry is also experiencing a shift toward traditional cigarettes. in particular, vapers are increasingly choosing to vape rather than smoke. vaping has become a substitute for smoking, and a regulated trade, with e-cigarette companies offering e-cigarette products and manufacturers producing traditional cigarettes. e-cigarettes and traditional cigarettes are not yet mutually exclusive products. there is no clear consensus as to whether vaping is a viable new nicotine replacement. e-cigarette companies are experimenting with e-cigarette products, such as cigalikes, and traditional cigarette packaging. in the e-cigarette industry, traditional cigarettes are a major component of the tobacco product market. e-cigarette companies are selling e-cigarettes as a safer alternative to traditional cigarettes. traditional cigarettes are sold in many countries, but e-cigarette sales are strongest in the united states, united kingdom, and canada, and are declining in other countries. in the e-cigarette industry, there is a significant shift from the traditional cigarettes to the vaping industry. traditional cigarettes are still the dominant product in the e-cigarette market, but the vaping industry is growing rapidly. by 2020, the e-cigarette market will have reached $US70002020, with a market share of about 80%. in the uk, the market share for e-cigarettes was estimated at about 04% in 2019. in the u.s., e-cigarette companies are also dominating the traditional cigarette market. a 2015 pew research center study found that 75% of american adults vaping is ""engaging in promotion, marketing, advertising, and purchase in order to reach young people and help them to quit smoking"", and that 18% of americans vape at least once a month. e-cigarette companies are also targeting young people by offering products that are not intended to be smoked, such as the e-cigarette e-cigarette. the products that e-cigarette companies are selling are not intended to be smoked, and products that are not marketed to young people are not being sold in the e-cigarette market. e-cigarette advertising includes product placements, promotion, and product reviews. e-cigarette companies have also developed and marketed electronic cigarettes, which are not expected to be smoked. in 2019, a british father demonstrated that his son could be trained to inhale from an e-cigarette.cigarettes have the potential to become the next tobacco product. tobacco companies have been urging smokers to switch from traditional cigarettes to e-cigarettes, a shift that some experts say could have a negative impact on tobacco control. e-cigarette use has been increasing in the eu. in 2013, e-cigarette use increased by 18% among 10-44-year-olds. in 2012, e-cigarette use increased by 38% in europe, and in 2015 by 41% and 50%, respectively. e-cigarette use among 10-14 year-olds increased from 2013 to 2015. e-cigarette use among 15-24 year-olds increased from 2013 to 2015. e-cigarette use among 25-34 year-olds increased from 2013 to 2015. e-cigarette use among 35-44 year-olds decreased from 2013 to 2015. e-cigarette use among 45-54 year-olds decreased from 2013 to 2015. e-cigarette use among 55-64 year-olds decreased from 2013 to 2015. e-cigarette use among 65-74 year-olds decreased from 2013 to 2015. in the us, menthol has been used as a substitute for e-cigarettes in many e-cigarette products. e-cigarettes are not intended to be smoked, but smoke-free devices have been sold. a 2014 pew research center survey found that 13% of e-cigarette users reported they vape for pleasure and 7% for nicotine. a 2015 pew research center survey found that 13% of e-cigarette users vape for nicotine, 9% for menthol, and 4% for a flavored e-cigarette. e-cigarettes are not intended to be vaporized, but vaporized flavoring is used to impart a taste and aroma. e-cigarettes are not intended to be inhaled or ingested. the flavoring may have an odor, taste, and other characteristics depending on the composition of the liquid and the vaporization method.some brands of e-cigarettes are marketed as ""vaping"",",0,1

" andrew mcchesney, a professor of political science at the yale school of management, has suggested that social inequality is a more important factor in the 2012 election than the economy, terrorism, the trade deal with canada, and the obamas nominating and confirming processes. he contends that the economic downturn and the terrorist attacks changed the politics of the country for the worse. he attributes this to the displacement of the middle class by the poor, the decline of conservatism, and the erosion of the middle class through technological advances. another prominent economist, robert coase, professor of political science at yale, has suggested that the great depression and the beginning of the cold war contributed to the election of george w. bush and ronald reagan, while the trade deals of the cold war contributed to the election of barack obama. in his book, political plants: the causes and consequences of the great depression  sharon salz, professor in political science at the yale school of management, has found evidence that two factors together can explain the election of scott pence. the cold war gave people a reason to be politically fearful, and terrorism gave people a reason to be politically terrified. pences victory over trump was ""due to pence being a stronger politician than obama"".the election of barack obama as president was widely perceived as a major success for the socialist socialist party. the party achieved a new, unprecedented level of influence in the united states government. in the 2009 election, the party had controlled the government through the work of the democratic party of the united states  obama won an estimated 332 of 568 electoral college votes in the u.s. congressional elections, more than any other democratic candidate since 1920. he took the most votes in the states that produced the most candidates. in the presidential election of 2012, he received more votes from independents and democratic-leaning super-delegates than any other candidate.obamas most notable accomplishment has been the passage of the patient protection and affordable care act, commonly referred to as ""replace-or-subtly"" health care reform legislation. the legislation, signed into law by obama on december 19, 2010, is the largest health care reform in the history of the united states. it addresses the problems of high costs, high deductibles, and the high costs and deductibles of health care. it is also the first time in the history of the united states that a single political party has succeeded in winning both the majority in both chambers of congress and the presidential election.obamacare, the largest health care reform in the history of the united states, was partially repealed by the president of the united states on december 19, 2013. obamas replacement plan, the american health care act, was partially re-passed in december of that year, and in february 2014 the supreme court upheld its constitutionality.obamacare is the product of an expensive and lengthy political battle between the parties. while the american health care act is considered by some to be one of the most politically expensive pieces of legislation in american history, other parts of the healthcare law have been found to provide substantial tax benefits and reductions in costs. the law also expanded medicaid eligibility for indiana residents and provided tax relief for individuals in the virginia and mississippi.obamacare has had a significant impact on the health care system in the united states. since its passage, the number of people without health insurance has decreased from 13 million to just over nine million in june 2014. in addition, the number of people without health insurance has increased from two million to three million in july 2014. the uninsured rate has declined from 35.4% in 2005 to 31.7% in 2014.obamacare also expanded medicaid eligibility for indiana residents and provided tax relief for individuals in the virginia and mississippi. it also expanded the medicaid eligibility age and lowered the cap on indiana residents who would be eligible to receive aid from public programs. the law also lowered the co-payback time for Medicaid and co-payback for private insurance plans from 6 to 3 years.obamacare also expanded medicaid eligibility for indianas 15 million uninsured poor. the law also said that if an indiana resident had a pre-existing condition, they could lose their health insurance coverage. the indiana congresswoman josh pravo said the law was ""a big, fat wad of money"" that had to be repaid with tax revenue.in july 2014, the kansas legislature passed a bill that required nearly all indianas businesses to offer health insurance to employees. the bill was signed into law on july 1, 2015. in september 2014, the kansas supreme court ruled the state could opt out of the health care law. in 2015, the federal courts upheld the decision.in 2014, the national institute for health and american research  the nhc finds that mandating health insurance coverage for indiana workers will have no positive effect",0,1

bike in los angeles. theres a reason why people like to ride a bike. because its safer. because its a form of exercise that doesnt take up much of their time. many people like to exercise in the company of other people. theyll say its hard to get to the park in los angeles. its because its a much more comfortable and familiar experience. many people who love to ride a bike also like to take

of teaching children throughout their lives to memorize material in order to better understand and create knowledge in the child. it is often seen as a work of the parents, teachers or other caregivers as a method of teaching, however, it is also intended to improve the childrens self-confidence and mental health. it is also believed to help parents and children to learn more in a less structured way.the term homeschooling covers the use of homeschooling by students  in many cases the training is done at home, rather than at a school, facility, or institution. the purpose of homeschooling is to help the child develop skills in house and learn at his or her own pace. students train by making crafts, learning crafts, and other activities. students complete projects individually, such as constructing items such as chairs, walls, beds, and a christmas ornament.theyll find many different types of information, teaching methods, and resources on the internet, in books, on youtube, or through the local school system. some homeschooled students may also obtain on the internet the materials they need to complete a project. the principal difference between homeschooled and public schools is that students are not allowed to ask questions, but must follow teacher led instruction. this is a form of learning that many parents choose to do in private schools, however, many public school students do not have this choice.in the private schools, students are allowed to choose which teacher leads they wish to follow. theyll be seated in a specific row, given a specific task, and then graded based on effort. it is also common for students to participate in group learning. the principal difference between homeschooled and public schools is that the student can be given material at home and choose which teacher to receive it from. in the classes that are taught at home, students are not allowed to make their own learning materials nor learn how to complete a project independently.studies have shown that children who have their own school and teachers are more likely to be referred to a counselor, in some cases, this is done in a ""cold book"", in which a teacher teaches only the material in the books materials. the counselor visits the child for a short period of time, after which the student is taken to a different classroom where a counselor teaches the same subject. some homeschooled students also enroll at a for-profit school or a charter school, which are also different from public schools in that students are not allowed to ask questions or learn from the material.a ""home-schooling"" or ""home-education"" is a childs choice type of home education. it is an educational method that involves providing materials at home and then using those materials at the beginning of the childs education. the child is not required to be a student in the traditional sense, but a student can be a student in the ""home schooling"" sense. a ""home-education"" may be customized to the child based on what skills the child already has, or the child could learn from scratch. a ""home-schooling"" is a method where the child learns through play.a homeschooled student may receive formal or informal ""support"" from parents, teachers, or other students of the school, community, or other group to help them achieve an education. this can include instruction in the home about the schools ""core curriculum"", such as the core curriculum, lesson designs, and lessons, such as composition, grammar, and spelling, taught by non-educational staff. a homeschooled student may also receive referrals to tutoring. the student will learn in a tutoring environment, with non-educational teachers and other students providing instruction and support.home schooling is a form of attendance that is generally more structured and less spontaneous than homeschooling. it is a learning experience for students, where parents, teachers, or other students of the school provide education at home. it is also a learning environment where parents, teachers, and other students learn through play.home schooling is a learning environment where parents, teachers, and other students provide instruction and support.home schooling may also be called home education, home-based education, home-based learning,",0,1
"the united states has been known to have the most prolific of all nations in the world in terms of climate change; it is the largest carbon emitter per capita, and the worlds two largest emitters of greenhouse gases.as a nation, the united states has been the leader in environmental activism since the beginning of the 20th century. the united states has been at the forefront of several environmental movements, and the environmental movement has had a particularly strong presence at the national level in the united states. the environmental movement grew out of a reaction to the cold war. the environmental movement is often described as a ""conservationist"" - the conservation movement is devoted to the preservation of natural resources, such as the environment. the term ""green"" is often used interchangeably with the term ""environmentalist"" or ""socialist"" to describe those who work to minimize or mitigate environmental damage, such as those working to reduce global warming.environmentalism emerged from the anti-establishment movement in the 1960s and 1970s whose leaders were socialists and environmentalists. the movement focused on environmentalism as an alternative to environmentalism, sometimes identified as a ""renewable energy"" or ""energy conservation"" movement. the movement urged alternative forms of social organization to address environmental problems, such as energy poverty, energy shortage, and energy policy. the movement stressed the need for people to be able to solve environmental problems without resorting to the fossil fuel industry. it was strongly associated with the anti-establishment conservation movement. the environmental movement was primarily associated with a radical environmentalist perspective, including a concern for the earths ecological sustainability. the environmental movement attracted a strong following in the 1960s and 1970s, with many student environmentalists involved in environmental issues. the movement attracted a large following among younger people, particularly during the cold war. the concept of ""renewable energy"" was first used by the alliance for a just transition, a coalition of student environmentalists, industrialists, and libertarian economists for environmentalism. the coalition was formed with other student left-wing political organizations. the term ""renewable energy"" is a combination of renewable energy  the new york times wrote in 1974, ""renewable energy has become a new political force; the environmental movement, once a dead-end for the leftist activists, has become a force of life.""renewable energy is an alternative energy source, and is usually associated with wind, geothermal, hydrothermal, and solar energy. however, it has also been associated with hydrogen, ethanol, and biofuel as well as electricity and even hydrogen-rich liquid fuels. wind power and geothermal energy are often used to power electric vehicles, some of which have been used to send people across the atlantic ocean to a new life. some wind turbines have been installed at military bases to provide a continuous source of energy.renewable energy is typically specified as kilowatt hours  the energy required to produce one watt of electricity is given as eewb, or kWh, the value of kWh for electricity production is given as eew, or kWh.a wind turbine, like all wind power plants, uses energy that has the potential to be stored as carbon dioxide, but is not. the energy stored as carbon dioxide is called greenhouse gas  therefore, any energy production from a wind farm must be balanced against the potential to recapture carbon dioxide. as of 2009, the major energy storage technologies that exist are battery storage and the use of tectonic plates to strain the crust to release trapped carbon dioxide.carbon dioxide is a gas produced by human activity that can be stored as carbon, either in the form of carbon inorganic carbon or a mixture of carbon in the form of carbon. when stored as carbon dioxide, it is a solid at minus 273.5, the carbon is said to be in the form of carbon monoxide. in the presence of a catalyst, a mixture of carbon dioxide and oxygen is formed, which reacts with the reactive groups in the gas. this reaction creates a gas called carbon monoxide, which is a solid at minus 273.5. it is not clear how carbon monoxide is formed. it is formed by the decomposition of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere  the amount of carbon dioxide is unknown, but it is thought to be as a byproduct of the decomposition of carbonic acid.the production of carbon monoxide, as opposed to gas produced by burning fossil fuels, is the method of production that is most commonly used to dispose of carbon dioxide. it is also the most carbon-intensive. the production of carbon monoxide is the most energy-intensive part of the manufacture of carbon credits, and intertidal zones are another important source of energy. the production of carbon monoxide requires a catalyst that can store carbon dioxide as carbon dioxide, a material that is not produced by burning fossil fuels. this requires a catalyst that can store carbon dioxide in the form of carbon monoxide. the carbon dioxide that is required to make one ton of carbon dioxide is not produced by any particular process. rather",0,1

", the legal status of being a lawyer is recognized by law of the sea, article 32, article 49, article 70 of the australian criminal code, the australian criminal code section 18.1, and the australian criminal code section 18.3. in some cases, a person that is not a lawyer is guilty of an indictable offence even though he or she is a lawyer. the term ""unlawful practice"" is also commonly used.the first lawyers, the baron de paris, were lawyers who were active from the 16th century to the 18th century. the first lawyers were british in origin, and their clients were mostly british aristocrats. the first baron de paris was the 17th-century baron henry paul vi of london. the first lawyers in the european colonies were british as well. the british began representing their peers and clients in court in the 16th century. the british east india companys first lawyers were british in origin, and their clients were mostly british barons. the first lawyers in the netherlands were british in origin, and their clients were mostly british lords. the first lawyers in england were british in origin, and their clients were mostly british barons.in the united states, the first lawyers were actual lawyers, like the baron de coeur dalaz at the bar at philadelphia, the baron frederick at philadelphia and the baron george at the bar at philadelphia, among others. in 1741, the first u.s. attorneys were british in origin and their clients were mostly english aristocrats.in the early 17th century, the baron louis xavier de chambord arrived in paris and started representing english clients at the bar of the auguste dangevin, followed by other barons in 1761. the first european lawyers were established in scotland and hungary in the 17th century, and they were followed by other lawyers. the british east india companys first lawyers were british in origin and their clients were mostly english barons. in scotland, baron edmund davy was the baron of cheshire from 1656 to 1667, and baron francis willoughby from 1671 to 1679. british baron edmund davy is known as ""father merv"" as he is the only player of the name davy to have won the jackie macdonald tournament in his career. other players such as willoughby, the earl of yonah, the earl of yonville, the earl of yonville, the earl of yonville and others were also influential in the development of the field.the legal profession developed rapidly after the legal profession emerged on the continent. the british east india companys early members included bobby morgan, john bronne, thomas burke, james cuthbert, and edmund davy. bobby morgan was the first british lawyer in new south wales and the first south westerner to win the british east india prize. john bronne was the first south westerner to win the british east india medal. james cuthbert was the first south westerner to win the british east india medal in 1837 and was the first south westerner to win the german east india medal in 1843. edmund davy was the first south westerner to win the british east india medal in the twentieth century. he was the first south westerner to win the golfers alaa grade at the start of the 20th century. in the early 1900s, the profession began to decline as unemployment rose, and a large number of young lawyers left the profession. the rise of industrial capitalism in the latter twentieth century saw a large increase in the numbers of lawyers in the profession. in the profession, a new generation of lawyers has emerged that do not take easily to the idea of being a lawyer. they are not easily swayed by the slick commercial presentations that lawyers receive. they are determined that their opinions and arguments are based on solid legal principles and they are confident that they will be heard.the history of law in the united states can be divided into periods of the following three main branches0th century through the 1960s, and again beginning in the 1970s. each of these periods of law followed a different political paradigm. during the 1960s, the presidency of lyndon b. johnson shifted the focus of the federal judiciary to areas of law that were more relevant to the federal government than the states. this was done to give the courts more power to resolve disputes and to ensure that federal money was not used to settle disputes outside of the federal system. the federal courts",0,1
"sodium chloride is used to treat pediatric cancer because it is a very effective treatment for pediatric cancer.  in children with cancer in the brain, the effects of this therapy are consistent with those of the anti-mrc treatment paclitax.  because of this and the limited progress made with other cancer treatment methods, it is recommended that scl is used as a last resort only in the most aggressive stages of cancer, when other less effective treatments have failed or are unlikely to be successful.in healthy people, the body makes more sodium chloride than it needs. therefore, the body makes sodium chloride in its attempt to fulfill basic needs. this happens organophosphorus like chloride, which is caused by the photosensitization of chloride ions in water. in the body, this photosensitizes the sodium in the blood stream. the sodium builds up in the body and prevents it from being properly utilized by cells. this happens organophosphorus like in the case of the photosensitization of chloride ions in water, it is stored in the body as sodium phosphate, which is further ionized to form chloride by the action of the electrolytes in the body.in normal people, the body makes about 8-chloroalkylresorl the salts in marijuana are the active compound, with the disaccharide molecule, d1-alkyl-m-(1-nitro-4-brominated hemiphilic acid sodium chloride is a salt that contains the chemical formula, n-alkyl-resorl, the same as sodium. it is used for many purposes, including as a salt for human consumption, as a salt for fish and other shellfish, as a salt for amphibian eggs, as a salt for amphibian eggs, and as a salt for aquarium fish.  it was developed by the chinese in the early 1960s to replace saltpetre due to its superior ripeness and its low molts content. it is used in many places as a condiment, especially in the form of powdered salt, to be mixed with food, particularly in chinese cuisine.  it is also used for chewing and drinking.in the us, the salt content ranges from 0.1% to 3.5% salt. fresh jesse is classed as salt, though the jesse obtained from a bottle is usually not salt at all, more often a syrup or a paste. coffee and other prepared foods prepared the same way as food may be classified as either prepared salt or finished salt.salt is used in many situations in cooking to give flavor or to add texture. in cooking, salt is placed in a container with heat and the salt water will begin to vaporize. this vaporization usually occurs when the salt is placed in a piping bag, and when the heat is applied to the salt water, it causes the salt to boil. salt is not required to be placed in a water container, salt is just used in a piping bag to collect the water and prevent it from evaporating. in one example, the international salt commission provided a chart to help food chemists distinguish between salt that is treated with heat and salt that is not. the chart indicates that heat treated salt has a higher melting point and a lower boiling point, but a lower temperature for salts. this may be advantageous for certain applications such as making salt from seaweed and making salt from coar, slivers, and grains. however, it cannot be used for other purposes because of the high heat and the loss of vaporization through contact with air.the term ""salt"" is usually used to describe co2, but this is not universally true. in the united kingdom, the word ""salt"" is used in certain contexts to describe co2, such as in a public statement about the ""preference of ale, mace or salt"" over ale, mace or salt. in the last of these uses, however, the word ""salt"" is used at least as far back as c. 1300 in the meaning of the term ""salt"" in lithuania, the word ""salt"" is used as a synonym for co2:xii  co2 is the isotope of the element carbon, and it is known to have a significant influence on the composition of the atmosphere.the atmosphere of a planet is composed of two primary layers: the carbon dioxide layer at the center of the earth and a thin layer known as the ethylene atmosphere above it. below this layer are oceanic water vapors, which are mainly made of water-soluble carbon compounds. the atmosphere of a planet is also home to neutral nitrogen compounds, including carbon 2 , carbon 3 and carbon 4 .salt is a key greenhouse gas because it is the most effective carbon-based chemical store, and also because it is the cause of global warming. the amount of warming caused by atmospheric sulfur is greater than the amount due to co2 dioxide alone.air pollution, in the form of aerosols, are a far greater greenhouse gas to",0,1

" the ancient greek philosopher celsus wrote in his history of the world against the tetrarchy which is considered by many to be the core of the taoist and hsrian ideas on how to win the wars of the world. the taoist celestes advocated a strategy of conquering the weak points and creating a powerful empire through an active re-awakening of the noble savage. the hsuan school of taoism, founded by hsin, aimed to build a powerful empire through a combination of military conquest and economic expansion through trade.the chinese taoism and hsin school of taoism were both opposed to the taoist and hsin school taoism is a school of thought that views the tao as the only truly universal universal spiritual teaching and the only way to attain immortality. it is different from hsin school of taoism in that hsin considered the tao as a path that can be followed without necessarily experiencing death, and likewise, it is not the path that can be followed without experiencing death. the two schools are considered to have been closely connected since the beginning of taoism.the origin of taoism is generally considered to have started in 221 bc when the taoist master buddha satyamena, along with buddhhatyamena and buddha-instinct, founded the buddhist order of six treasures in japan. the buddhist order of six treasures was founded by buddhist monks whose primary goal was to free themselves from the restraint of worldly desires and to awaken to the pure teachings of buddha. they did this through intensive study in buddhist monasteries and temples, and through the practice of buddhist medicine.taoism was a major school of thought in chinese history. huang kong described taoism as ""the one philosophy, the one path, of the tao."" taoism developed from buddhistism, which was the dominant world school of thought at that time, and was the school of thought that huang kong, chinese nationalist leader tao bajie and other chinese leaders were brought into being taoist monasteries and temples.taoism developed out of buddhist teachings, especially the four chan masters  the buddhist order of the six treasures was a school of thought that saw buddhism as a way of seeing the world, and taoism as a way to achieve this in practice. the buddhist order of the six treasures developed out of buddhist temples, out of the temples themselves, and through buddhist monks who disseminated buddhist teachings and rituals to taoist magistrates and lay persons.taoism has had a long and complex history. taoism has existed as a religion, an art, a philosophy, a culture and a political movement, and has been both the subject of and the object of academic study. in the western world, taoism is the most well-known and widely practised religion, with temples in nearly every western country, schools, scriptures, temples, lay organizations and temples, all of which are temples of the western world. taoism is the second-most studied religion in the world, after christianity.the taoist canon includes mantras, sutras, and a number of works that contain the tao as the central concept. many of the texts of the tao are expressed through these works and the taoist canon is one of the major sources of taoist theology.the taoist canon includes texts from the buddhist traditions of india, china, tibet, japan, and laos. texts from the hindu and sikh traditions are also found in tibet and india. texts from the chinese buddhist tradition are also found in laos. tibetan buddhism has also been influenced by buddhist traditions.tibetan buddhism also has its own buddhist traditions. these are also known as buddhist buddhist practices, buddhist monastics and buddhist spirituals.tibetan buddhism is also influenced by jain and taoist traditions. some of the buddhist practices are associated with the practice of buddhist meditation. tibetan buddhism also has buddhist practices, such as chanting buddhist mantras and buddhist buddhist ceremonies. some of the buddhist mantras are associated with the practice of buddhist meditation. buddhist spirituals also practice buddhist meditation.tibetan buddhism also contains buddhist practices such as buddhist medicine, buddhist ceremonies, buddhist rituals, buddhist monastics, buddhist vows, buddhist practices, buddhist practices, buddhist iconography, budd",0,1

"2016 was a year for the big bang theory. a study of the data available to the national statistical institute showed a significant increase in the number of deaths linked to unexplained cosmic inflation since 2014. the inflation apparently kicked in after the big bang. the number of reported deaths could not be explained away as a result of a terror attack, a natural disaster, or some other phenomenon. all four of the seven biggest bang theories are now mathematically confirmed.the 2015 and 2016 pyramids of giza were built by seven children of egypt. the pyramids were completed in 3,884 and 2,962 years, respectively. the pyramids were built by slaves from the greeks and egyptians of the ancient near east. the vast majority of the work, approximately 3,900 men and 2,200 women, was carried out by the same group of slaves. the pyramids were built in a desert climate with no natural springs and excellent sanitation facilities. each of the pyramids was guarded by a different kind of slave, whose duties included monitoring the pyramids and the work of the pyramids.the remaining 1,064 years, during which time the city of egypt was under the rule of the anointed one, were described by the greek philosopher isocrates. isocrates visited egypt in the 2nd century bc and reported that the land was covered with the flesh of animals, both domestic and wild. he also found there a sea-borne disease which killed young men who drank too much of the water it contained. isocrates believed that this disease was brought by the the greeks to the land. during the 109th year of the pyramids, the sun god set his eyes on giza. the greeks overthrew the sun-god and brought the pyramids to their capital at maadi. it is implied by isocrates reports that he visited egypt when he was twenty-five. in the year following, egypt was ruled by the anointed one, who also became the sun god. the pyramid of isocrates is the oldest known structure in the world. the pyramids were built by the pyramids and temple workers, who were egyptians in the 3rd century bc. the pyramids were destroyed by the egyptians when they conquered the land in the 4th century bc. the pyramids were replaced by a single, more powerful structure, the great pyramid of giza, which ultimately collapsed in 3,690 bc. the two pyramids are the pyramids of the second dynasty of egypt  a similar structure, the pyramids of the third dynasty of egypt  and the great temple of isa, the first pharaoh of egypt from 2553 to 2650 bc. in both cases, the pyramids were built by skilled craftsmen; the arab pyramids and arab great temples were built by craftsmen without any knowledge of engineering.the pyramids were ruined from the beginning, owing to an earthquake which damaged the foundations. a second earthquake in the year 767 brought further problems. the pyramids were damaged beyond repair, and the arab pyramids were partly reconstructed from the ground up. the arab pyramids were completed in 1000 bc; the egyptian pyramids in 1350 bc. the arab pyramids were used for several purposes during the egyptian golden age: they were the site of the great temple of isa, the main temple of the sun god muhammad, the main building of the el kharij hotel, and the site of the cairo stone circle. the pyramids have been used for these purposes at least until the end of the 2nd millennium bc. on the other hand, the pyramids were used by the nubians as defensive structures in the period immediately following their conquest of egypt. in the 3rd millennium bc, the pyramids were used by the gogurye fabric system to sew fabric-covered sections of the temple interior. the pyramids were built to withstand impacts at this time.the pyramids were used as burial mounds by the gogurye fabric system. the temples were built in the temple and the funerary cult within the pyramids was developed in the temple and around its perimeter. the temples were built as funerary domes with numerous ornate carvings depicting deities from the primary deities of the egyptian pantheon, though most gogurye monuments are thought to be the work of a single master, as the pyramids themselves were not intended to be a burial ground. the temples were designed specifically to serve as passageways for funerary travellers, as they were well-suited for this purpose. the pyramids were commonly used by the nubians as a temporary resting place, as they did not have any permanent archetypal temples for the dead.in the 3rd millennium bc, the temple of isa was built on the western side of the volcano of pyramid nova, as neighbouring isa bay was accessible by boat. the pyramids themselves",0,1

"hence the greek term threskeia, which means ""threskeia"", means ""threskeia"", the feminine form of  hethryia, the feminine form of  hethrypha, the feminine form of  hethrypae, the feminine form of  hethrypaea, the feminine form of  hethrypene, the feminine form of  hethrypisca, the feminine form of  hethrypiscitactylus, the feminine form of  hethrypsilon, the feminine form of

kantalia, the feminine form of  k3.priestly celestials. the term is also used to refer to those who take vows as priests, typically after having performed strenuous acts for the benefit of god, and to those who hold such vows, for example, in a funeral or reinterment.the roman catholic church teaches that s. athanasius  that the church, ""since the roman catholic church holds sacramental ordination for those who are called to priesthood by faith in accordance with its tradition, it is also the duty of all christians to sanctify their fellow priests by prayer, the imitation of his example, and the service of sacramental grace"".the church teaches that ""obligation to the bishop is always based on a mutual agreement of good will and mutual respect for one another, arising from and constituting the bond of friendship, which unites brothers in prayer and mutual love"".the church teaches that ""in the ecclesiastical relationship between brothers, a brother is obliged to teach, advise, defend, and encourage the brother in all his  teaching, advising, or pastoral care"".the church teaches that ""the bond of friendship is strengthened by mutual support, which is the basis of trust, which unites brothers in prayer and mutual love"".the church teaches that ""brothers need not be strangers in each other for the sake of christ, nor strangers in the world alone, if they will only receive it graciously through charity"".the ecclesiastical and sacramental blessings of marriage are conferred by marriage, and are shared by the couple, whether in a conjugal partnership or a singal union.the ecclesiastical and sacramental blessings of children are also shared by parents and by their children.a blessing is a manifestation of closeness, friendship, and belonging to a community of believers who are living in the same geographical area. a blessing is also a sign of commitment to the community, shared commitments, shared expectations, shared love, shared opportunities, and shared responsibility.the word ""blessed"" is derived from the ancient greek word 此  the term was probably originally used by the romans to refer to a wedding gift.the term is usually rendered as ""a person who has been made a friend, associate, or supporter"".the term ""blessing"" is used in place of ""wedding gift"" because it implies that the recipient had been made a friend, associate, or supporter.the term ""holy"" is used to refer to the activity of holy orders such as the eucharist, mass, and holy week. holy orders such as these engage in offerings to the community in various ways. holy orders such as these engage in the provision of sacraments, the administration of divine service, the celebration of sacred liturgical and pastoral occasions, and the service of the body and blood of christ.holy orders are those instituted by the central authority, of which there are many in the catholic church, as well as the laity, and sometimes, though rare, the catholic church provides information on how to join them. the church does this not to promote particular religious doctrines, but to assist members in understanding the process for joining and evaluating the status of their request to become a member of a holy order.holy orders are usually organized into hierarchically organised groups called territorial orders, called curia, which operate in the milan, venice, rome, and other cities, provinces, and states of europe. some holy orders have developed hierarchically into confraternally organised groups called territorial orders. each territorial order has a territorial president, the vicar of which is called the deacon, and his deaconesses are called ""priests"" or ""deacons"" within the larger order, as distinguished from a typical patriarchal office.priests and deacons are usually, but not always, members of the laity. some are lay clergy, such as the laity, seminary teachers, or missionaries. clergy in the catholic church are generally required to be celibate.the catholic church does ordination for all men  women may be ordained by the bishop of the diocese of rome, the bishop of the city of rome, or the bishop of the diocese of pompei. women may also be ordained as deacons or priests by the bishop of the diocese of rome or",0,1
"the products of modern physics are called particles. particles are organized into the fundamental units of matter, which are called atoms, and composed of other molecules called molecules. the properties of matter are studied in detail by those who study the physical properties of matter.the study of particles and their interaction with light is called spectroscopy. light is organized into photons  some of these photons are scattered in all directions, but only some  a few particles escape the initial scattering, and thus only certain objects can see them.the study of the properties of matter and light is called spectroscopy. the scattering of light by atoms and molecules, and the properties of matter are studied in detail by those who study the physical properties of atoms and molecules.physicists study the properties of matter and light with great care, observing phenomena such as absorption, emission, emission, and emission. the properties of matter and light are studied in detail by those who study the physical properties of atoms and molecules.the study of the motion of light in the atmosphere is called spectroscopy. the motion of light in the atmosphere is studied in detail by those who study the dynamics of light as well as the properties of gases in detail.physics professor jean macfarlane breaks down the scientific discipline into three branches:acoustics, which deals with the interaction between sound and air, is the branch of physics that studies sound. it is the branch of science that examines the physical mechanisms of sound, and the study of sound in detail.physics professor noah feldman studies the behavior of high-energy particles, which are the particles that make up the high energy of the universe. particle physics is the branch of physics that deals with the behavior of particles at the very high energies that they provide, being the fundamental subatomic particles of physics.ergravitational-collars are the study of colliding objects that provide gravitational forces. gravitational-collars are also the study of colliding black holes, which are the objects of interest in the astrophysics.physics professor robert hoagland has studied the behavior of large scale structures such as galaxies, and clusters of galaxies, in detail. his research is focused on the formation and evolution of galaxies through time. he has studied the motion of galaxies through time, and investigated the formation of the first galaxies, through the largest known regions of the universe, and the evolution of the universe from a common beginning. he has also studied the distribution of matter in the universe, and its formation in detail.hoagland also studied the distribution of matter in the universe, and its evolution through time, and his research is focused on the properties of large scale structures such as galaxies, and clusters of galaxies, and the formation and evolution of multicellular organisms.physics professor jeremy haggan finds theoretical inspiration in physics experiments, and uses those discoveries to formulate new ideas. his research involves investigating general relativity, general relativity, physical cosmology, classical physics, quantum physics and string theory.his experiments have revealed that the speed of light is a measure of the speed of light, and that the speed of light is a measure of the speed of light. he has also discovered that the expansion of the universe can be used to measure the speed of light, and that the expansion of the universe can be used to measure the speed of light.the history of physics is the history of discoveries and understanding. in the sense that the process of discovering and using new ideas was started, not ended, the history of physics is a period of time that starts and ends with new discoveries. the period is divided into two parts: part i deals with the development of new ideas, and the part ii deals with the understanding and experiments of the empirical.physics is the branch of science that deals with the physical world, the behavior of physical objects and the physical nature of matter. it is also a branch of mathematics, a branch of the sciences of general interest, and a part of the physical sciences. in the sense that it is a branch of science, not a branch of mathematics, and the physical sciences are the study of objects outside our world, it is a period of research that deals with the physical world, not with the mathematics of physics.physics leads to a number of branches of inquiry, some of which are mutually exclusive. the scientific study of nature is called physics. a number of physical sciences are related to physics. for example, both mechanics and electricity are branches of physics that apply to both motion and the electric and magnetic forces, respectively. the study of electricity and magnetism is also a branch of physics.physics is a broad subject area that encompasses a large range of topics, covering topics such as the formation and collapse of planets, the flow of matter in the universe, the nature of light, and the physical process of thermodynamics. a particular focus is on the

"twisted ends  in their original form, the flowers are large, cylindrical, and green in color. in the western variety, the blooms are fusarium shaped and may be irregular in shape, resembling a cap; in the variety that has been domesticated, they are flattened, having a pointed tip and fringed ends. the flowers are borne in a sclerotized or sclerotized sepulveda  the sepulveda is formed from a sclerotized sepulveda and is fringed at the petioles, forming a bun, while the crown is sclerotized. the petioles are fringed and sclerotized in the western variety, while in the variety that has been domesticated, they are fringed and sclerotized. the flowers are borne in a sclerotized sepulveda.the sepulveda has been separated from the fossil record, but many of the characteristics of the fossilized petioles and petioles are preserved. for example, the flower lobes are fused and arranged as corrugations rather than petioles, and the sepulveda has elongated, flattened petioles rather than petioles. the fringed base of the petioles is fused to form a ""woven"" shape, similar to that of the modern capillaria. the fringed base of the petioles is also fused to form a bun.the sepulveda is separated from the fossil record, but many of the characteristic fruiting characteristics of the fossilized petioles are preserved. for example, the fruit is flattened and close to the skin. the petioles are also close to the skin, being formed from fused sclerotized and fused petiolized sepulveda. the sepulveda has also been reconstructed in many plant and fungal species.the pollen grains are dispersed throughout the plant, being arranged in three layers: the first, the seed coat , the second, the woody portion of the plant the pollen grains are composed of a sclerotized sclerotized woody material or sclerotized seed coat. pollen grains are fringed, being arranged in a ring or grove at the borders of the leaf.the first layer is the sclerotized woody portion, which is fringed at the petioles. this sclerotized woody material often has sclerotized sepulveda fringed sides as well as sclerotized top and bottom. at the top of the sclerotized woody portion is a sclerotized bottom. the bottom of the sclerotized woody portion is fused to form a petioles. the petioles are fringed at the borders, being arranged in a ring or grove.the second layer is the sclerotized seed coat, and at the top of this layer is the sclerotized woody portion. here, the seed coat remains intact, but the sclerotized woody portion has been modified in some places to become sclerotized corrugations. these corrugations are formed by interferences of sclerotized sclerotized woody material and sclerotized seed coat. the sclerotized corrugations are formed by interferences of the sclerotized seed coat and sclerotized corrugations.the third layer is the sclerotized corrugations. at the top, sclerotized corrugations once again remain intact but sclerotized woody material, or sclerotized top, has been removed. prunelles and frangable woody parts are sometimes found here.the flower buds are composed of interlocking ""loom"" cells, which are arranged in a flower shape and are responsible for the shape and appearance of the flower. the cells are formed by interlocking ""loom"" structures such as rings, cones, and pollen grains. within each cell contains cells that are neither paired nor connected, thus forming a continuous pattern.the flowers are not only the most basic structure of a plant, but are also its primary product, its most valuable resource, and the centerpiece of the plant. from the plant, various plants are harvested for their various parts of the plant. the product is used by the plant to provide it with nutrients and by humans as a source of colour, flavour, odour, etc. the plant is a symbiont of its hosts. the plant is adapted to store and utilise this nutrient in the form of a liquid, typically stored in the cells of the flower buds. the flower buds are the primary producers in the plant and the only time they are harvested. the plant is also adapted to store this in the form of a solid, which is then utilised by the plant when it matures. a well-developed plant has leaves that allow it to access the environment and store this energy as heat",0,1

"2015 was a year for young women in the united states where they had a minor role in society.  in the u.s., the proportion of 18- to 24-year-olds with no family declined from 37% in 2014 to 26% in 2015, and the proportion of 25- to 54-year-olds with no family increased from 34% in 2014 to 37% in 2015. in 2019, the oldest people in the us were 60. in all age groups, women were older in 2015 than in 2014 and 2017. in 2015, the proportion of women in the u.s. who were unmarried declined from 2013 to 2015. in the us, as in many other developed countries, marriage declined from 2013 to 2015. however, as of 2015, marriage was still the most common type of union among women. in 2015, the median age of a u.s. female population was 25. the fact that fewer young people married or were in a civil union is likely due to the rising divorce rates in the u.s. and the divorce of partners previously in a union. for instance, in 2013, 25.0% of u.s. women aged 25 to 34 were married. in 2015, the divorce rate in u.s. women aged 25 to 34 declined from a high of 67% in 2013 to 31% in 2015. divorce among young adults of unmarried partners in 2015 was the second-lowest in the world the proportion of young people in the us who are obese in 2015, the average manchester city centre family weighed over 315.6% more than their female counterparts. in the us, obesity is the leading preventable cause of death among young people. youth are more likely to die from obesity-related causes than are their adult counterparts. in 2015, 13.1% of the us population aged 15 and over reported that they were obese. in the united kingdom, obesity is the third most common preventable cause of death.obesity and its comorbid conditions are the leading preventable cause of death in people of any age in the us, where 80% of deaths are caused by obesity. people in the united states who are obese have a higher mortality rate than people who are not obese. in the us the obese rate is higher, on average, than in any other high-income country, such as canada  higher rates of obesity are seen also in people who smoke and in people who drink alcohol.in the us, children who are obese have a higher risk of death than those of their obese counterparts. a us study of over 26,000 children found that obese children are 35 times more likely to die in a year than obese children in early childhood. this is compared to a us study of over 11,000 children, which found a rate of 5.6% that were obese in the past 30 days., isis is the phenomenon where a person changes from one form of living to another due to causes not directly related to the actual physical act of eating.  is sometimes contrasted with the customary or societal practice of eating within a diet or the lack of it. there are four main forms of is: the traditional, the non-conventional, the non-traditional, and the cultural/ethnic diet.the term is usually used in reference to an action or a food that has a negative effect on the body; for instance, a food that contains aluminum can make the child sleepy and prone to seizures. another example might be when a person eats a food that is highly sugary and has a high fat content but has no effect on the body, or a person who is obese eats foods that are low in fat and have a high carbohydrate content but has no negative effect on the body. the action of eating or drinking the food is often measured by the amount of weight the food loses  in addition, weight loss can be measured by the rate at which the food is regained. the loss of weight is known as the diet.the rituals within a diet are sometimes referred to as rituals.  for example, the ritual of the three days of the fast in the quran, the fast of zakat, or the fast of tahbigh. the fast of the quranic fast is one example of a ritual that is part of the diet. the fast of the tahbigh is a ritual that is part of the diet. the fast of the tahfat is also a ritual. the diet of a muslim is often a form of religious observance, in which food is offered as a sacrifice to god or to mankind. in other rituals, the food and drink of the cult leader are offered to god or humanity.the fast of the quran in the quran, the fast of the quran, and the fast of the quranic variant, the quranic variant, that is the most common, are collectively known as the hafiz.  the term hafiz comes from the arabic word hafiz, a form of the greek word 0",0,1

"st. bernardo de santos was a 16th-century financier and a military officer. he was a staunch christian and opposed the idea of slavery. de santos was also a military commander in the viceroyalty of new granada and a viceroyalty general in the viceroyalty of new spain. he also wrote a series of books on the subject, which were translated and popularized by the spanish conquistador fernando de soto. de santos was a proponent of the spanish colonization of the east and middle americas, a policy that spain pursued from 1427 to 1436. de santos was also a proponent of the concept of spanish dominance in the americas, which spain pursued from 1436 to 1442. de santos was a staunch confederate warrenite, and during the war he wrote several racist diatribes against jews and christians, including one called against ""the red eyed perts"" and another called against ""the colored perts"". he also expressed support for the system of a ""white plata firma domingo"" which spain followed in the 16th century. de santos also expressed support for the system of a ""white plata firma domingo"" which spain followed in the 16th century. joseph de soto wrote a book opposing the system, titled the white plata firma domingo, in which de santos expresses his concerns that christianity and muslims would oppose him in spain. de santos supported the system of a ""white plato"" that spain followed in the 16th century.the first use of the word ""slavery"" in english is sometimes attributed to a 12th-century physician named thomas aquinas. in his treatise on the medicine of fermentation and for the dissection of yeast, aquinas describes forced labor as the worst form of slavery. however, the word ""slavery"" is not found in any of aquinas works, and slave labor was not mentioned in the 19th century.  thomas aquinas is known to have been influenced by the writings of piratical piratical and piracy against other human beings. slavery was mentioned in the works of other cultures, such as the gypsies and the guaitans.slavery and slave labor was the backbone of the european labor force during the late middle ages. the labor of the textile and leather industries created a strong middle class, and the growing wage labor force meant that laborers were able to move around freely in the cities. however, the abolition of slavery after the second world war and the rise of libertarian socialism would lead to an increased reliance on slave labor, which would still be the backbone of the economy after the 1980s.the world slave population was estimated at about 4 billion in 2018, of whom about 66 million were enslaved in the world, mostly in the arab world  the majority of enslaved peoples are held in chains or in brothels, with the demand for slaves being supplied by the dominant culture. the enslaved peoples are either killed as booty or used as forced labor in the manufacturing of goods. in many places, slaves are transported across borders as in the case of vietnam.slavery is the modern variety of the former flesh and blood of the beast, the latter the body or the former body of a human being; or the former being or the latter being, in the strict sense of the word. the former, in particular, does not include the dead  the former, in the strict sense, includes the dead  the latter, in the stricter sense, includes the dead  in the more liberal, less restrictive sense, slavery is the status of being forced to do or perform a particular work or perform a service for another person. slavery was a common practice in ancient egyptian and chan chinese culture.in the late 19th century, the term ""slave"" was attached to the surname negro to distinguish non-white people from white people. in the western world, the term slave is often used in the sense of slave or slave, a more restricted sense of the term, and a more restricted sense of the term white.the word is often used euphemistically to describe people from non-white races who are considered to be ""sub-human""  the term is often applied to physical or sexual slavery.the word is sometimes used in a broader sense, as in the phrase slave plantation or slave labour.the legal age of slaves was legislated at the time of the american founding in 1789. slavery was again outlawed by the slave trade act of 1807, the trans-atlantic slave trade act of 1819, and the fugitive slave clause of the fugitive slave act of 1850.the civil war and the start of the 19th century marked the emergence of the modern slave trade. the zulu slave code was passed during the 1820s and",0,1
"the sun is the warm, moist surface of the sun that provides a positive temperature gradient on which the climate is based. like the earth, the sun is a sphere, with a center point at the equator and a periphery at the poles. unlike the earth, the sun is a globe, with a center point at the north pole and a periphery at the south pole. the sun is the only known partially elliptical body, and the only terrestrial body that rotates around its axis.the poles are the only part of the earth that are warmer than the north pole. because the north and south poles are much further away from the sun  this is the reason why the north pole has had a much warmer climate than the south pole. the surface of the sun is much more reflective than the surface of the earth. the albedo, or brightness level, of the sun is higher at the north pole than at the south pole because the albedo is much higher at the north pole than at the south pole.the albedo of the sun is determined by the ratio of the luminosity of the sun to the area of the moonlight that falls on the earth. the higher the albedo, or the greater the amount of light reflects back from the sun, the hotter the suns surface appears. at a value of 700\\xa0th century. with the advent of dynamical systems, such as dynamical systems of the sun, the dynamical system of the sun can be perturbed with the movement of the earth. the sun and the earth are now moving apart, due to the movements of the moon. the suns movement is causing the earth to move slightly, which is causing the oceans to reflect some of the energy back into space. in the past, this energy was used to create large quantities of iron, but the emission of iron from the oceans now causes the oceans to lose their heat. once the energy is released, it is possible to see the effect of this energy on the oceans surface. at the same time, the heat of the deep ocean is being made available by the movement of the warm surface of the sun, so the heat of the sun itself is being made available. this heat is being made available to the oceans, so that when the warm surface is moved to the left, the heat is made available for the conversion of chemical energy into heat. this heat is now being made available for the conversion of energy into heat and light, and the heat of the sun itself is being made available for the conversion of chemical energy into light and electricity. this heat is now being made available for the conversion of chemical energy into electricity and light.electricity is the basic energy that powers computers, appliances, robots, appliances, robots, and many other systems. it is also the source of light that allows light to be sent from one place to another, or to be emitted by a source light, into another place, or into the world at large. it is also the source of sound, and the stimulus for many other sounds. electric power was invented by the german burgener ralph cernovsky  as of 2010, electric vehicles have reached speeds of 60 kilometers per hour  the amount of energy used to create and sustain the electric power in a vehicle varies with the speed, but is typically in the range of 20 to 50 kwh batteries, which are about twice the energy used by a typical power grid to store electricity. in 2010, the energy density of energy in a renewable resource like energy was estimated at 149 gJ joules per kilowatt-hour.  battery technology is expected to increase the density of energy sources in a renewable resource like energy to be released, but to store and convert electrical energy into mechanical energy. the mechanical energy for such conversion is stored in the form of a battery, which is then used to conduct electrical current in the form of electricity. the energy stored in the form of battery is then used to power a mechanical device like a motor, generator, or other mechanical device. the energy stored in the form of battery is then converted back into mechanical energy, which in turn is used to provide electric current to a mechanical device like a motor.the energy of the earth, the mass of the earths crust, is the fundamental resource of the universe. because its vast size and composition are similar to that of the solar system, earths gravity pulls the planet into a circular orbit around the sun, the suns gravity acts on the earth, bringing it into a semi-transparent orbit around the sun, and then rotating the earth so that it appears to be rotating on a helical spiral. the rotation of the earth causes the suns gravity to act on the earth, bringing it into a semi-transparent orbit around the sun. this causes the earth to appear to rotate. this process of solar self-emergence repeats in a region of space periodically. the same process can be used to measure the distance to distant stars.the earth is also the center of the earth system, composed",0,1

"st. bernard, catholic archbishop of milan, said in a statement: ""the church is shocked and saddened by the tragic events surrounding the passing of joejay d. davis and the senseless killings that occurred in the city. the outpouring of support and prayers from the entire catholic church is with joejay and his whole family at this very difficult and painful time.""the parishes of caldecott and fort wayne met on october 12, 1967, at a breakfast meeting of the church of the holy see in rome. the two priests shared a common commitment to the liberation war and shared the same political philosophy: ""we believe that the fight for human freedom starts with the liberation of the oppressed."" in addition to the traditional unionist, catholic and liberty unionist symbols, they were encouraged to form a union with the anglican churches.in may 1970, the first annual congress of the catholic church in south carolina was held in philadelphia. the congress was a gathering of representatives from both the catholic and liberty union congregations and was attended by about 2,000 representatives of the three major political parties. this was the first such gathering in south carolina, and it is also where the first black republican elected to the u.s. house of representatives was elected.in 1972, the south carolina legislature enacted a law that excluded from voter registration rolls the religious and political affiliations of those who did not live in the state or vote in the state. the law was challenged in a suit by the people, who alleged that it violated the states constitution and unfairly discriminated against them. the courts dismissed the suit three times in the 1980s and 1990s, and in the last two cases the court of appeals for the eleventh circuit overturned the discriminatory voter registration law suit.federal court rulings in the early 1980s affirmed the south carolina voter registration law. on february 22, 1986, the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit overturned the discriminatory voter registration law suit.in the early 1990s, a lawsuit challenging south carolinas voter registration law was filed by the american civil liberties union, american library association, and south carolina democrats. the lawsuit alleged that the voter registration law violated the states constitution and the fair elections act. the courts dismissed the suit three times in the 1990s, and again in the 2000s, and in both cases the court of appeals for the eleventh circuit overturned the discriminatory voter registration law suit.in the 2010s, the south carolina legislature passed a voter registration law that was challenged in a suit by the south carolina chapter of the cfba. the legislature subsequently repealed the law without effective implementation. in the 2011 u.s. midterm elections, the national republican senatorial committee paid a visit to the state to monitor the progress of the case.south carolina is home to a number of institutions that are memorialized in the state. the confederate battle flag, the confederate battle memorial, the confederate battle field, and the confederate battle iv all stand in stark contrast to the many sunday flag displays throughout the state. in the united states, syringes are the state symbols and are prominently featured in state flags and state sealings, while confederate battle flags are venerated in tomales. confederate battle flags are stored at the confederate battle museum in hancock county. the confederate battle fields and battle iv structures are significant because their names, dates of birth, and military unit served as pivotal events in the history of the confederate cause. they are also significant because the confederate battle fields and battle iv were on display in the confederate battle library at fort wayne until 1983. the confederate battle fields and battle iv are on display at the confederate battle flag museum in hancock county.the confederate battle flag, with the battle flag emblem of the confederate states, is displayed in the confederate battle flag stadium in hancock county. the confederate battle flag is also on permanent display in the confederate battle re-enactment school in glade, south carolina.in the southwestern part of the state, the confederate battle flag is the state emblem, although it is not the official state emblem of south carolina. the confederate battle flag is displayed as an emblem at the confederate battle flag stadium in hancock county. the confederate battle flag also is on permanent display in the confederate battle flag museum in hancock county.the confederate battle flag was the first state emblem to be used for funds raising in south carolina.the confederate battle flag is a symbolic flag of the confederate states, designated as the ""state flag"" in the 1866 constitution. it is distinguished from other symbols of the confederacy, as it does not bear any state seal, and does not appear on official state business.",0,1
"aka ""the convention of the sexes"" is a set of conventions, rules, and codes that guide the conduct of a persons interaction with others. the goal of the convention of the sexes is to make human society conform to the biological differences between men and women and to encourage and support the equal treatment and opportunities of men and women in society. the term was coined in 1901 by a group of scholars and activists concerning the violation of gender stereotypes by the sexual oppression of women by men.according to karl kenrick and carroll quigley, a pair of sociologists, ""the conventions of the sexes"" are ""structuralized through gender roles"" and can be said to form a social norm"". the sets of conventions are shaped by the dynamics of gender relations and the construction of power relations. these conventions are transmitted from generation to generation.according to scholars, there are a number of competing explanations for these gender roles. one explanation is that these roles are not mutually exclusive and that the variations in roles between men and women reflect a generalization of gender roles across cultures. another explanation is that gender roles are not universally shared and that gender-variant people have been historically discriminated against on the basis of gender roles. a final explanation is that the differences between men and women are due to individual differences in cognitive, affective, and affective styles  the convention of the sexes is used by men and women to justify their differences and to control their emotions.adolescents are taught in schools to use gender-variant language to talk about themselves and to express their gender identity. adolescents also learn about their own gender identity through the media, such as the gender role that they were assigned at birth. these teachings also help them to feel comfortable in their own skin. however, the age difference between a male and female has not been found to influence the way adolescents self-present their gender identity; rather, it has been found that the age difference between men and women is only a small cause of their gender difference. in contrast, older children are more likely to be influenced by a theory on gender stereotypes, which explains the observed gender difference in test scores and the belief that older children are more confident talking about themselves and less likely to believe that other children are talking about them as well.between the 1980s and the 1990s, as intersex persons became more widely accepted, they came to be viewed as having a gender identity in contrast to the traditional gender roles that historically defined their gender. these theories were often based on a variety of assumptions, such as the notion that gender roles are universal, that gender roles can be culturally fluid, and that sexual orientation is fluid. these theories also had problems with evidence, such as the widely cited 2010 study that concluded intersex people are genetically predisposed to having gender dysphoria  and the 2009 study that found only 12% of intersex people are likely to be homosexual.the international standard defines the term ""intersex"" to include individuals born with gonadal or genital sex characteristics that do not fit typical binary gender categories, such as the intersex male or female, intersex female, and intersex male. apart from these, there are also people whose sex was not designated as ""male"" or ""female"" in their birth certificate but whose sex was ""assumed"" to be male or female. these are people who are neither males nor females.intersex individuals are those whose sex is the opposite of the typical binary gender categories, such as intersex woman or intersex man. they are the ""undiagnosable"" because they are ""far beyond the developmental stages typically associated with the typical gender categories"":they are ""developing brains that are undeveloped but shaped by sex.""in addition to intersex individuals, gender dysphoria in some cases is first diagnosed in childhood, while other cases are diagnosed as adults. there are cases of intersex people who are transgender or cross-dresser, whose sex was not designated in their birth certificate but whose gender was inferred from their gender identity or appearance on the basis of their sex appearance in their youth. the terms transgender and cross-dresser are often used interchangeably, although transgender is sometimes used more broadly as an umbrella term, including gender variant or cross-dresser.the international standards set out clear requirements for the expression of gender identity. the ICS defines genderqueer as ""a person whose genderqueer identity corresponds to the sex that they were assigned at birth"". it also specifies that a transgender person is someone whose gender does not match their appearance, genderqueer is more specific, meaning a person whose gender does not correspond to their appearance, while cross-dresser is someone whose gender does correspond to their gender identity. trans is used more often in the contemporary context, while cross-dresser is used less often.the term transgender is sometimes used as a pejorative, although not always.the term transgender is sometimes used derogatorily, as being synonymous with transsexualism  transgender is, however, not completely interchangeable with transgender. some transgender people",0,1
"staley, a former partner at carroll & silvey, has been involved with the film since its inception. he was originally interested in adapting the novel to screen for a limited runtime, but found that the novel was too complex and enthralling for that. instead, he found that having a film shoot-out format would serve the film better as it had more of a story than a random witness. he also found the story elements boring.film historians have noted that the film may have inspired the british school of playwright john maddison. each of the film characters had the character invent a play, or say something that caught the audience by surprise. the film also had a number of playwrights who had a hand in shaping the dialogue. the film also had a number of directors who were interested in directing the film., stanford university is a private research university located in stanford, california. it is the second oldest institution of higher education in the united states and the first

" is part of the cranium. the cranium is the outer layer of the skull, the largest and most complex of the three mammalian skulls. it contains many sutures, embedded nerves, sinuses, and foramen. it is also where the air and water of the lungs are vented. cranium is divided into three parts, a lower jaw, an upper jaw and a gill pouch.the fossil skull of a 17- to 18-million-year-old homin was discovered in the jakarta desert in september 2006 by thomas henry trompfert. its skull measures 15.2 by 10.1 by 3.6 metres  the knuckle-less, or ""phulpen knuckle"", is a hominid of the middle Pleistocene species and thus closely related to modern humans.the hominid cranium is a classic example of a ""supercranial"" skull. the skull, which measures 15.3 by 11.1 by 3.5 metres  a 2016 study of the skull of a hominid from china identified a partial occiputectomy, possibly a type of retrocranial sutura. the retrocranial sutura is a partial occiputectomy of the frontal part of the skull.the earliest known use of cranium fossils was in the fossil record preserved in the holocene cranium of the extinct palaeoloxodon africanus. the earliest known use of cranium is in the holocene fossil record from the late eocene fossil holocene of lungfish  there are three species of cranium: the lithostracophoid cranium  the most recent cranial species are the africanized, or amauropod crana.the african cranium is often mistaken for the amauropod, which has been suggested to have been an ancestor to at least two hominids. however, the genus atlacracophus is more widely accepted to be an independent species. craniums have been proposed to have been evolved from amauropods, but evidence for this has been conflicting, and much work remains. it has also been proposed that the cranium was evolved from a monophyletic group of about 50 million years ago.the first hominid known to be extinct was palaeoloxodon namadicus, which was cambrian- and caspian-adapted with the largest skull of all modern mammals. this made it possibly the most ""modern"" of all hominids. it also gave it four features unique to modern humans: it had short snouts, large upper jaws, well-developed lower limbs, and large brains.the last common ancestor of hominids and other hominoids that are still extant are the gracilian, meaning ""mammal-like"", and bantu-like. the gracilian also possessed the largest cranium of all hominids, but its demise was short-lived, as it expired during the cenozoic era about 217 million years ago. the last common ancestor of hominids and other hominoids to be found in the fossil record is the amauropod crania. the last common ancestor of both groups was the hominid crania. the amauropod is slightly smaller than the hominid and has a shorter skull, a less convex upper jaw, and less cranial capacity. the cranial capacity of the hominid is similar to that of the hominocranial groups.the hominoid crania are the only two hominids that have partial skull, but their crania are also the only two that lack a well-developed skull. the earliest known hominids that lacked a complete skull did not emerge until after the cenozoic and not until the palaeozoic. the earliest known hominid that did have a complete skull is homo habilis, which lived 245 to 161 million years ago. the crania of homo habilis are shared by both the australian and brazilian groups. the australian group shared the largest cranial capacity of all hominids, with the dna-genetic analysis suggesting that this was the result of a haplogroup i substitution. the brazilian group shared the largest cranial capacity of all hominids, with the dna-genetic analysis suggesting that this was the result of a haplogroup i substitution. the australian and brazilian groups shared the last cranial capacity of all hominids. the franco-pilam manual is the collection of stories that developed around the franco-american model of human creation. the stories were collected by different groups of people within the year between 1821 and 1829 and the publication of the first edition in 1826. the book was an important document in the understanding of human origins, the development of social behavior,",0,1
"9th century. the journal of american history, edited by hispanic american historians such as roosevelt t. duncan, is partially dedicated to the journal.the first black colleges and universities were founded in the united states in the early 19th century, mostly in the southern u.s. in addition, african-american universities were founded in the late 19th century, as well as the first african-american art galleries were established in the united states.in the united states, the first american women-only college was established at harvard university in 1844, followed by mary college, duke, the first women-only university in the united states, and the first african-american law school. the first african-american business school was established at harvard in 1893. the first women-only business school was established at the university of massachusetts in 1899, followed by duke and harvard.the first american university to admit african-american students was duke university, in 1905. a total of 11,374 students applied for admission, including nearly all of the white students. the new york times described the racial makeup of the students: ""men and blacks stood apart, and in almost every other respect the character of the school was one of the least conspicuous of the classes."" the newspaper also reported that ""for the first time the african-american was not the first class""; the first was the latino.the first african-american students to enter the university were the students of hispanics. the first was arizona law school graduate and a student of the new school. in 1910, hall honored hispanics and their contributions to the university, and the first african-american student to be accepted into the graduate program of hispanic or latino was salyanne purple.in the early 20th century, african americans comprised approximately 52% of the undergraduate enrollment at the university of texas. the 1982 african-american enrollment rate at texas was 30.6%. in addition, the academic year was divided into two semesters, beginning in march, and a number of electives, including electives in history and criminology. the administration of the university of texas at austin, under the chairmanship of the presidents of the two schools and the first african-american dean of the school of law, was the first one to admit a mexican.in the 1960s, the school began to encourage more students to identify as mexicans, and to participate in chinese and afro-american cultural life. the school began a year-long mexican cultural tour, and hosted the mexican cultural celebration. in the 1970s, the school started the mexican cultural exchange program  through the mexican cultural exchange program, students visit mexico, discover mexican culture, and participate in chinese and afro-american cultural life. the mexican cultural exchange program was created before the mexican-american war of independence, when american troops fought against mexican forces. mexican francis was a symbol of the united states during the vietnam war conflict, and the war in vietnam was commemorated in the mexican national holiday, mexicos independence day, and in the independence day holiday.the first african-american mexican to enroll in the university of texas at austin was cesar chavez, a student at the university of texas at austin in 1968. five years later, he enrolled as a management professor at the university of texas at austin, teaching a class of more than a thousand courses in business and marketing. he became the first full-time faculty member at the university of texas at austin, and the only central texan to teach a business course. in 1970, chavez was one of seven mexican mexican faculty members to serve as president of the texan association of schools and colleges.chavez also served as the president of texas association for school reform  the group began in 1968 as an alliance between several local conservative groups and the student union and the union of conservative students of texas. the coalition completed a four-year study of the various schools and concluded that ""the mexican school system is the most powerful in the nation and is almost totally dependent on federal dollars and federal programs."" the group then launched an unsuccessful student strike in 1969 and organized a failed sit-in movement in 1970, which chavez witnessed. in 1970, chavez became the president of the texan conservative student union  the group conducted massive student sit-ins in several major american universities, including the university of texas at austin. chavez was instrumental in recruiting new members and building a conservative student movement in the state. the organization challenged the integrity of democratic elections in the state, challenged the legitimacy",0,1

".the subject of the animal kingdom is a wide-ranging area of study that traces its back to ancient greece and ancient india, although its beginnings predate the world as we know it. the term ""aquatic kingdom"" is often used to refer to a particular region or country, while ""aquatic society"" or ""aquatic law"" is sometimes used to refer to a society or a political system. in the united states, the mexican state of tlaxcala, and in some other countries including the united kingdom, the uk, australia, new zealand, and canada, the term ""aquatic kingdom"" is used to refer to various geographic areas, or regions, encompassing all of the oceans and all of the life that is not terrestrial.the word ""aquatic"" is derived from the ancient greek 0th century, conservation efforts in many parts of the world were focused on the preservation of pristine ecosystems, and efforts were made to limit human-induced destruction of natural ecosystems. in the united states, the soviet union and other countries, the use of fish farming became a major way to restore ecosystems. since the industrial revolution, aquaculture has become a major way to feed the worlds growing population. aquaculture is practiced and regulated according to strict laws and regulations with the goal of sustainability. the usage of the term ""aquatic"" comes from the latin aqua, meaning water, and the ancient greek aleph, a fish. the term ""aquatic"" is used in the context of the fishes, the freshwater fish, or the aquatic plant, and the medieval vernacular term ""aquae"", a fish.the word ""aquatic"" was used in the 16th century by william herschel to refer to some of these fish, specifically the clark  many medieval writers included a number of species in this group, including the aqua, the bahrain, the chukchi, the dhol, the gourdet, the grosgan, the hart, the ibises, the javan, the kiel, the moravia, the netherlands, and the swedish town of burg. there are three species of bony fish, the saltwater piersids or saltwater crocodiles, the freshwater snails and the mega-saltwater crocodiles.the earths oceans are over 6,000,000  and are believed to be as dry as the earths continents. the oceans water is not frozen on the north pole, but is in fact over 100,000 km2. they hold the water as the most important resource of the planet, and currently are the worlds largest water producer. the oceans surface is not covered by land plants, so there is no carbon in the atmosphere, but is indirectly affected by carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. the oceans annual ocean surface water absorption does not exceed 3,000,000,000 litres per year. this is equal to 3,154,000,000   by comparison, the earths oceans heat capacity, which would be needed to melt snow and heat the oceans annual oceans surface water absorption, is equivalent to the annual heat absorption of all human-made carbon, excluding deforestation and land use changes. the oceans annual heat uptake is greater than that of all land, and is greater than that of the entire earth. oceanographers use a variety of models to estimate the heat uptake of oceans, but the best known is a ratio of 0.1 between the oceans annual heat uptake and the global ocean heat content. the ocean absorbs some of the heat from the land surface and radiates it as heat from the deep oceans. this process, known as heat sinking, is the same for both land and ocean.atmospheric oceans are dominated by water vapor, and are mostly composed of water vapor suspended in a vapor phase. infrared radiation, mostly from sulfuric acid, and some from carbon dioxide, cause water vapor to condense on the ocean surface and cause water to freeze. this condensation results in a water-reversing process called osmotic circulation, wherein the water moves past, and absorbs, organic molecules, thus reducing the concentrations of these molecules in the water and the Osmotic circulation. oceanographers use a variety of models to estimate the heat uptake of oceans, but the one that is most widely accepted is an exchange of water vapor for carbon dioxide. foam is the best known oceanographer to use this method, although others have used or plan to use another method.eelmeproterozoic sea  is also known as the megafauna, which is the only living creature to have paleozoic teeth. it is the only living creature to have teeth in the jaw position. its jaw has nine ""lobes"" on top of each tooth and has worked its way up to a total of 21 grooves. it is similar in form to the extinct palaeoloxodon amoensis, but",0,1

"spain was the biggest oil producer in the world, but oil production was restricted by prohibition and the military. the population of spain was dependent on foreign trade, and the spanish state had to import large amounts of foreign goods. in 1810, the spanish government declared that all oil wells must be shut down. until 1819, spain had been exporting oil from its own reserves to other countries. the economic crisis of 18209, however, did not allow for the importation of more oil into spain. the spanish government began to develop an external policy towards oil producing countries in the 18th century that included oil, coinage, and land grants. as a result of the french and british economic crises in the 19th century, spain became an exporter of oil and became a net importer of oil in the 19th century. by 1850, spain had developed into a multi-national state and economy and was the worlds fifth largest oil producer, after the british empire, the united states, and france.although spain was a net importer of oil during the first half of the 19th century, it was a heavy oil importer in the second half of the 19th century. during the first half of the 19th century, spain was the seventh largest oil producer in the world after the united states, japan, and canada. spain had the largest oil reserves of all the oil producers in the world, and they were the largest oil reserves in the world by volume. in 1885, it had 13010, it was the 5th largest oil producer in the world. spain had a bad economy in the first half of the century, partly because of the spanish civil war and the subsequent decline of the economy. the spanish civil war of 1936 to 1939 was the worst industrial war the country ever suffered.in the 1940s, the economy slowly recovered from the spanish civil war, but the war cut off oil revenues for years. spain was again placed in a period of economic decline in the 1950s and 1960s.spain had an oil-exporting government during the spanish civil war that had to balance the budget, pay interest on loans, and make payments on exports.spains oil revenues were not balanced until the 1970s. during the 1980s, spain had a balanced budget, but after the 1990s recession, spain had a negative balance, unable to service its debts. the government was forced to raise taxes or cut spending.spain had a gross domestic product of $34007, having risen to $36007. the countrys economic growth rate slowed slightly to 3.5% in the first quarter of 2013, and was the slowest since the year 2010. in the second quarter of 2013, economic growth picked up again, to 5.3%, while unemployment fell from 11.9% in the first quarter of 2012 to 10.5% in the second quarter of 2013. the countrys trade balance with the world was a negative $2054.4 million in the first quarter of 2013.spain remains one of the most indebted countries in the world, as evidenced by the size of its sovereign debt. despite this, spain has the worlds third-largest economy and the fifth-largest military in the world, and is one of the worlds top ten largest manufacturing nations.spain is a unitary state and is divided into 14 parishes0th century, a combination of the cities of leyden, hubbard and seahaven in the united states. the spanish flu pandemic is commemorated on the 50th anniversary of the pandemic, which spain opened the year following on 13 february, which has been observed as a mark of solidarity with the spanish community in the event of pandemic and spanish flu pandemics in one anothers countries, and the united states and canada have been affected by the pandemic and are witnessing a multi-phased effort to combat the pandemic. the spanish government announced in june 2013 that the country would set up a $1019 that the spanish government would spend up to $11.4014, the population was estimated to be between 5 and 10 million. as of july, there were about 200,000 deaths. the death toll was expected to reach 1 million within a week.according to a 2013 study by the world bank, the average spanish in 2017 was 10.0 years. about 16.7% of the population had at least one parent who was born in the spanish community. the median age in 2017 was 39.7 and the total population was 44.9.spanish is the second-most widely understood language in the world, as people speak it todays. spanish was used as a language of the empire for over a millennium and was spoken as a language by the majority of the population. spanish was not written in stone, but rather ""in letters,  in each case of",0,1
"the international association for the study of philosophy, an interdisciplinary scholarly organization, lists 12 major philosophical schools, often based on particular significance of the texts considered most important. the study of philosophy is called the discipline of philosophy, and the study of philosophy or philosophy is called epistemology. other inter-disciplinary studies include:the study of philosophy often takes the form of an intellectual exercise or inquiry, such as philosophical inquiry into the philosophy of art or philosophical discussion about philosophical topics. some of these may be systematic, using methods such as surveys or surveys, discussion of empirical evidence, empirical analysis of theories and the development of theories, discussion of the social context in which philosophical systems are embedded or maintained, and the development of theories. the study of philosophy may also take place in non-scientific settings, including informal settings, such as the study of poetic structures or the study of language as a way of thinking about language.the primary students of philosophy often come from a variety of backgrounds, often having previous backgrounds in fields of study. there are students who study the philosophy of science, who have studied logic, and who have studied metaphysics. students who study religion, such as comparative religion and the study of religion and science, may come from a variety of backgrounds, including history, popular culture, and philosophy. students who study history or the study of religion may come from a variety of backgrounds, including popular culture and/or the history of religions. students who study philosophy may come from a variety of backgrounds, including:the study of philosophy can take many different forms, including formal classes, seminars, readings, and other educational settings.the formal study of philosophy began around 1600, when men like pascal kastelius, johann blumenbach, and auguste comte studied philosophy at university. later, in the 19th century, formal study of philosophy grew out of the discipline of political philosophy, which focused on issues such as sovereignty, law, morality, the divinity of the state, and the origin of legal theory. in the late 19th century, this discipline was further developed by the study of political philosophy, which sought to apply political philosophy to the philosophy of religion. the study of political philosophy also included the study of the philosophy of economics, and the study of the philosophy of the state  formal study of philosophy continued after the 1890s, including the formal study of capitalism, political philosophy, political sociology, and issues of political power and the rule of law at the end of the 19th century.a further development in philosophy of law came in the early 1900s, with the development of the positivist school, which defended the law as a rational construct with no objective validity, and the rise of modern liberal theory. in the 20th century, the positivists built on the ideas of the positivists with the development of individualist and anti-positivist perspectives. these perspectives led to the rise of anti-scientific positivism, which further developed into anti-scientific individualism and anti-scientific positivism. in the 20th century, anti-scientific positivism led to the development of the scientific positivist school, which defended the scientific method as a rational construct with no objective validity. the scientific positivist school also included the idea that knowledge is only the manifestation of knowledge of the world through the senses, or that the world is somehow unknowable through the senses. the positivist school further developed into the idea that knowledge is the material manifestation of knowledge through the senses. the positivist school continues to be a part of the current philosophical community.another development in the philosophy of science came in the 1950s, when the new science of quantum mechanics was developed. this ground-breaking work opened the way to a new understanding of nature. in the 1960s, the new approach to quantum mechanics was further developed by eugene fry and others, who established a model of the nervous system at the center of quantum physics. this model described the interaction of forces in quantum mechanics. the 1970s saw the scientific creation of new dimensions, with the formation of the quantum gravity group, and the studies of quantum mechanics and gravitation were created from this perspective.the study of physics, known as physics, has been described as having two schools:the first wave may be that of the physical moment, arising from the quantum mechanical moment or physical moment  the second wave may be that of the physical law, arising from the classical physics of nature and the theory of relativity.referring to the classical physics of nature and its theory of relativity, the following is a description of the quantum field called the quantum mechanics which is the basis for the study of the behavior of particles, and also the physical laws that govern the movement of particles and forces in the universe. the following is a description of the quantum field called the quantum field, and its implications for the theory of relativity.the invention of quantum mechanics allowed a new analysis to be introduced into the nature of motion in nature, and this new analysis caused the modern concept of time to be discovered. in 1806",0,1

"an ancient view, based on the knowledge of the dead, of the future state of the world, and of the social order and laws of nature, held that all human beings were created equal, that they are endowed with inherent rights, that society pre-supposes that some people will be able to acquire certain rights, and that the existence of particular human beings is a consequence of society pre-supposing that the existence of society pre-pre-supposing that some people will be able to acquire certain rights. the view can be traced back to at least the 4th century bc, possibly earlier. the construction of the plato republic was followed by a wave of epics, variously attributed to different authors, which sometimes overlapped or were simultaneously produced by and for the platoists. what is sometimes called the plato approach to ethics is often identified with the plato of the first century, and the ethics that were followed there. the ethic of the plato republic is highly regarded in the western world and is often called the plato ethics. in the majority of countries, it has become part of the public sphere, and is represented in public discourse. the platoians approach to ethics is often characterized by the phrase ""platoskaya polje"", which translates as ""always, always good""  the doctrine of the trinity was a concept that was central to the philosophy of the renaissance, closely linked to the ideas of the savants, and also to the ethics of monasticism. in the 17th century, the french philosopher saint-simon led a movement of secularization, rejecting the notion of divine right as espoused by the catholic church, the pope, and the learned laity. this was a reaction to the rhetoric of catholicism, which had been characterized by the importance of the role of reason and science, and the absence of religious feeling or worship. in the 19th century, a number of new forms of religious thought emerged, including new religious movements, such as the new religious reaction, the enlightenment, and the universal savior. the first person to use the phrase ""plato"" in a purely academic context was luca scannavino, professor of political science at the university of illinois, who wrote in 1787: ""the idea of a university founded on the foundation of free and unfree ideas, founded on the idea of free inquiry, founded on the idea of free thought, and founded on the idea of the equality of all human beings, is a very ancient institution.""plato also wrote numerous pamphlets which, although largely unpublished, influenced the development of the democratic political philosophy of the period. the most influential of these were the dialogues b uthere and tertullian, which were first published in italy and then translated into other european languages. plato also wrote the de rerum, the dialogues critica, and the ten kin of tertullian. other works by plato include the de rerum on the civil war, the de rerum critica on political economy, and the dialogues kin of ferus and kin.the philosopher plato is often considered to have had a major impact on the field of political science, through his works on the ethics of warfare and his method of metaphysics. plato also wrote the platonic dialogues, which were influential for centuries on the development of western political thought, and on the development of the philosophical discipline of politics. plato also wrote a series of dialogues on the view of the philosopher plato, the first of which was given as oral history. plato also wrote on religion and philosophy, in the dialogues kin of ferus and kin, as well as the ten kin of tertullian.plato is considered to have been the founding father of the liberal tradition in the western world, where economic democracy and the rule of law take primary place. platos thought is known as romanticism. his ""advice to men"" is the central theme in the romantic universe, a work that was widely read and heard throughout europe. plato is often credited with being the author of the founding text of the romantic movement.plato was also a major influence in the development of political thought in the eastern world, where, following the rise of islam, the dhimmah, and the decline of the roman empire, the qin dynasty was founded. in the islamic world, his influence was even greater, as the qin dynasty continued to expand throughout the following centuries to claim hegemony over the entire arabian peninsula.the classical greek philosopher aristotle is often credited with having laid the foundations of western political thought. many historians credit plato with providing the first philosophical justification for the existence of political entities such as governments, the rule of law, the legitimacy of sovereignty, and the legitimacy of government itself. he provided a systematic exposition of a set of propositions, called the law, and a complete analysis of the nature of legal systems and practices. plato then moved on to analyse",0,1

Paul studied the effects of bariatric surgery on overweight patients. the hospital used c6 waist-banding surgery to treat obesity and found it to be effective, but its cost was high. in 1983, the first clinical trial of bariatric surgery in a hospital was conducted at the medical university of mexico using patients who were already overweight. the procedure was successful and the results published in the journal of the american medical association.in 1982, the first randomized controlled trial of bariatric surgery to treat obesity was conducted by researchers from the medical university of mexico, the medical university of santos, and the medical university of santos. it was aimed at treating obesity in people who were obese but had not previously been obese. the team discovered a reduction in waist-to-hip ratio with the surgery. they also found that the patients who underwent bariatric surgery had more children.in 1986, the first long-term bariatric study was conducted by researchers from stanford university and the university of texas at austin. it was a randomized trial of a 12-month bariatric surgery program in six western cities. it was designed to evaluate long-term complications, quality of care, and costs in 80 patients. the surgery was conducted under two different modes: open-heart surgery and minimally invasive surgery. the patients underwent open-heart surgery while the minimally invasive part of the surgery was performed under the same principles as for open-heart surgery. in the trial, all of the patients underwent bariatric surgery and all but one of the patients experienced long-term weight loss.the bariatric surgery was a successful surgery that resulted in significant weight loss. the patients regained their preoperative health, behavior was back to normal, and the dogs that were used to guard against this procedure became tame. the dogs that had belonged to the patients prior to the surgery became feral when they came out of the animals pen.the american college of physicians officially recognized the value of bariatric surgery in 2000 when it issued the medical ethics statement for bariatric surgery.in 2008, the baltimore city council implemented a new ordinance that required all restaurants in the city to serve food and beverages ordered from an outside food vendor, such as colceltys or jack in the box. it also mandated that the food and beverage vendors serving the city ""be licensed to sell food and beverages"", and that all food and beverage vendors be inspected by a licensed food safety officer. the ordinance requires the vendors to post the name and address of the facility on their signs and in their advertising.the alabama department of corrections operates two correctional facilities that are also equipped with bariatric facilities. the first is the w.g. hefner state correctional institution, also in wyersburg, alabama. the second is the killeen warden prison, also in wyersburg, alabama.the american bar association has certified nursing program nurses who complete a one-year undergraduate and a one-year or two-year internship at accredited medical schools in the united states and canada. they may also work as part of a team of registered nurses in either a nursing or a medical environment.to practice as a registered nurse in the united states, patients must complete an internship in a health care facility approved by the us department of health and human services. according to the terms and conditions of this agreement, interns can expect to receive limited healthcare in a federally regulated facility, and may be offered transportation to and from their places of employment, and to participate in ongoing health education and healthcare workforce development programs administered by the us government. interns receiving benefits from public or private programs, or receiving services from nonprofit organizations, are not guaranteed to receive care in a federally regulated facility.internship with a federally regulated facility is typically a one- to three-year process. after completing the internship, patients can apply for benefits that are normally available to low-income working seniors. these benefits include dental benefits, vision benefits, and physical benefits such as dental",0,1

"pharmacy stores were threatened with imminent closure by the company. in the same year, the company opened only eight pharmacies in johannesburg, south africa.in 2014, the company opened three pharmacies in south africa, all in the capital city of port city brunei. the pharmacies are in the port city of johannesburg and the international airport of port city brunei. as of april 2019, the company was planning a further 180 pharmacies in south africa over a 5-year period.the company has also been operating a pharmacy benefits management business  pharmacy benefits management   is a managed care company offering health and dental benefits to pharmacy benefit managers. pharmacy benefits management is a part of the pharmaceutical industrys growing number of competitors.the companys point of contact is the united states postal service, which is both in the process of privatizing the pharmaceutical business and in the process of reforming its delivery of drugs and related services to pharmacy benefit managers.the company keeps the same number of employees as it did in the pre-dot com era, although the number of prescriptions filled has decreased slightly. the number of prescriptions filled in the united states has declined by one-third since 2001. in 2011, the average quantity of drugs dispensed per visit decreased from about 10,000 to about 9,000. it is the second-largest pharmacy benefit management company in the us. the number of employees in the united states is lower because the nature of prescription drug utilization varies by patient age, body type, health status, health conditions, health insurance status, health history, health policy, medications being used, health conditions, physician services being used, medications having been used, allergies, medications, and other factors.in 2013, the company had revenues of us$12.5 billion, with a ratio of us$120 million in revenue to us$20 million in debt.pharmacy utilization is the difference between the patients prescriptions and the pharmacies own prescriptions. this is is referred to as utilization in the united states and can be positively impacted by a patient having less or more frequent prescriptions filled.in the united kingdom, the center for drugs and medical devices a comprehensive report covering the companys full range of products across the companys range of brands and lines was released in december 2017 alongside a detailed explanation of how the report was to be interpreted. the report found generic medications accounted for 2.5% of cost of a patients prescription in the united kingdom in 2018, though new drugs often cost much more. the study estimated new generics accounted for us$29 billion of total prescription revenue in the united kingdom in 2018.the study also found that patient satisfaction was a significant determinant of prescribing decisions. it found that more than twice as many people were prescribed a particular medication in the year before they became dissatisfied with the way the medicine was working  in the united states, about 10% of prescriptions were for non-generic drugs. new markets were found to be difficult to open, with the average pharmacy in the united states refusing to sell to new patients for several years.a number of factors contributed to increased demand for prescription drugs. in the united states, the main sources of new prescriptions are over-the-counter drugs such as ibuprofen, acetaminophen, and naproxen. in the us, there were about 13,000 more outpatient prescriptions for narcotics per year in 2010 than there were in 1997. in the us, the average cost for a prescription is about us$79.50.a study examining the cost-effectiveness of relatively less expensive low-cost generics found that they generally were more cost-effective than older, more expensive generics. in the united states, the average cost for a prescription of a low-cost generic naproxen was us$340012 a study examining the cost-effectiveness of a limited number of drugs found that they are generally more cost-effective than old, more expensive generics. a study in the uk, examining the use of colchicine for colorectal cancer, found that it may be more effective than older, more expensive generics. a study in hong kong found that the use of colchicine may be more effective than the use of naproxen. a study in india, examining the efficacy of ten drugs with different dosing schedules, found that the drugs with higher dosing schedules had better effects than the less expensive drugs, although the effectiveness was dependent on the degree of tumor burden and the overall safety and efficacy of the drugs.a study in the us found that there was no difference in the overall safety and efficacy of newer drugs for children, adolescents, or adults. the cost-effectiveness of newer drugs is generally lower than newer drugs for the older population.the increased availability of newer, less expensive drugs has had a positive impact on the pharma. many of the drugs that were once reserved for the super-rich are now available to the middle class or even the lower classes, making pharmaceuticals a vital",0,1

"rivers are designed to be the most versatile on the planet, capable of carrying loads anywhere on the planet. they can carry more than humans, or ships, can carry. many world-class athletes use bicycles to transport themselves and equipment to and from competitions, events and places of practice such as track, field, and other sports. for example, the gold family uses bicycles to carry around their personal fire. mountain bikers utilize bicycles for these activities as well. the utility of bicycles in the transportation industry is their versatility and affordability, which has attracted a large number of bicycle-friendly products such as bicycles, helmets, and panniers for easy carry in cities and on the road.multiply this number to find the number of bicycle trips and miles travelled per day you can multiply each way. for example, if you can cycle for two hours, and then walk the rest of the way to work, you can safely estimate how many bicycle trips and miles travelled you will need to do each day to meet your daily commuting exercise minimum distances. the most common distances are usually between 05.07. they are usually at an altitude of up to 10,000 metres  most nations have minimum distances that reflect the wind and the average speed of the bicycle. for example, in the united states, a 20-metre  many countries have adopted national laws which have set minimum distances and times for cyclists. for example, in latin america and spain, the colorado national park and the national bike highway system specify distances and times that cyclists must travel. in brazil, the national bike highway system specifies the bicycle must travel at least 90% of the length of the road to reach any given distance.many bicycle manufacturers have released bicycle saddle designs. in the past, the designs varied significantly. today, most bicycles include a range of grips, from narrow, pointy metal inserts to much more complex and unique designs which enable the rider to customize the shape of the handlebars. many bicycle saddles are designed to help the bicycle rider maintain control and comfort while pedaling, including saddles designed specifically for bicycles with two wheels in a fixed position.the bicycle saddle is designed to provide optimal saddle comfort and control in a fixed bicycle position. the saddle is designed to fit snugly into the cyclists hand, preventing the rider from moving it from their saddle position. bicycle saddles are typically made from aluminum, carbon fiber, wood or some other lightweight material. the saddle shape also influences the type of energy absorption that is found in the material. for example, the work of gian marie cassini has shown the energy absorption of bicycle saddles to be significantly higher than for other materials such as carbon fiber, wood or silk.the bicycle saddle is meant to fit snugly into the cyclists hand, preventing the rider from moving it from their saddle position. bicycle saddles are designed to fit snugly into the cyclists hand, preventing the rider from moving it from their saddle position. the saddle shape also influences the type of energy absorption that is found in the material. for example, the work of gian marie cassini has shown the energy absorption of bicycle saddles to be significantly higher than for other materials such as carbon fiber, wood or silk.in order to reduce saddle pressure on the bicycle, some bicycle components are designed to function as springs. the spring-protected part of the bicycle is designed to slide up and down in the saddle to help the rider adjust the saddle pressure as needed. in order to provide a smoother ride, some bicycles are equipped with a dual-pump braking system that uses pressure plates and a spring-loaded system.velocity compensated spring, precision balance, and spring preload are some of the options that are used to adjust the pressure on the bicycle gas turbine. the pressure on the turbine is designed to be designed with a pressure plate and a spring preload in mind. the spring pressure and spring preload design pressure is designed to function like a pressure plate and spring preload, but at a lower pressure than the actual supply of gas turbine power. the design pressure and preload design pressure is designed to function like a spring and preload, but at a lower pressure than the actual supply of gas turbine power. high-pressure air is designed to flow through the bicycle, reducing friction and providing a smooth ride. to solve rotor speed balancing issues, a spring pressure interfacing between the gas turbine blades and the rotor is designed. the pressure and preload design pressure and preload are also incorporated into the design of the system

"-30-percent reduction in global production of cannabis, to 8.5% in 1990.cannabis is a highly intoxicating plant, and the most commonly consumed form of cannabis in the world. its high level of purity and high concentration of psychoactive compounds make it a dangerous substance, particularly to young people, pregnant women, and others. in the united states, the average age of first possession is around the time of consumption, and one study found first possession for an average of 19.57 days, while another found first possession for an average of 12.41 days. this can lead to a range of adverse health effects, including psychosis, loss of cognitive function, and dependence.smokers begin when the person first experiences the effects of the high. cannabis is primarily psychoactive, but some of its other effects are also detrimental, including its sedative effects and its effect to impair driving ability. long-term use of cannabis is associated with a decrease in a persons ability to drive a vehicle. cannabis may be used to treat conditions such as epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, glaucoma, multiple sclerosis, palliative care, palliative care, and multiple sclerosis. there is limited evidence that cannabis can help with some forms of amnesia, such as the amnesia that results from stroke, but the long-term effects of use are unknown. a 2016 study found that the symptoms that patients experience when they are given cannabis oil is similar to those caused by amnesiac symptoms.  effects of cannabis use are similar to those of all other commonly used illicit substances including alcohol, cocaine, and methamphetamine.the use of cannabis is associated with a reduction in motor vehicle collisions, as measured by a reduction in the incidence of rear-ended cars from 14% to 9% in a random sample of drivers. the average reduction in rear-ended car collisions was 0.5%, whereas the average reduction in overall car collisions was about 2%. the most frequently reported effect was a reduction in the number of traffic lights on a road, indicating a positive effect of cannabis on traffic safety.the most commonly experienced adverse effect of cannabis use is an increased chance of depression. of the 12 cannabis compounds tested, cannabis had the greatest effect on depression. of the 12, cannabis caused 15. the most often reported adverse effect was a feeling of euphoria, or feeling like you have just arrived at a high, a high feeling, or extreme displeasure. some users also report anxiety when using cannabis.cannabis has not been shown to cause cancer. the studies examining the effect of cannabis on cancer risk generally include well-controlled, randomized controlled trials. there are, however, limited evidence that cannabis may cause cancer. a 2013 study found that regular cannabis smokers have a higher risk of lung cancer than non-smokers, possibly because of the cannabis they smoke. a 2016 review found that regular cannabis smokers have a threefold increased risk of pancreatic cancer. on the other hand, a 2012 study found that cannabis smoking increases the risk of pancreatic cancer. the mechanisms of this effect are not fully understood.the risk of developing certain cancers, including testicular cancer, is increased when cannabis is smoked in combination with tobacco. in particular, the elevated risk is likely due to the chemical composition of cannabis, its terpenes, and its interaction with tobacco.cannabis smoke contains approximately 41 chemical compounds, including the active ingredients in cannabis, cannabinol, tetrahydrocannabinol, and cannabidiol. of these, cannabidiol appears to have the greatest effect on the nervous system. other psychoactive substances also significantly increase the risk of cancer. these include psilocybin, mescaline, ketamine, and delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol.marijuana smoke contains over 9,100 chemicals, including many that are not psychoactive, and these can have effects on the body that are similar to those of the cannabis plant. about half of the chemicals found in marijuana smoke are psychoactive, and about 420 are listed above.the levels of psychoactive chemicals found in marijuana vary from compound to compound.  for example, the most psychoactive compound found so far is cannabidiol, which is the active ingredient in cannabis sativa. cannabidiol has also been found to have some positive effects on the cardiovascular system. some of the main chemical compounds that are found in marijuana smoke are:cannabis sativa is the most widely cultivated and

" he was able to maintain good relations with the british government and military, and was the first to break the back of hostilities with the french by invading leone in 1739. in the same year, he defeated the french in the battle of d6 june 1741. following the death of louis xiv, the french had to back down on the issue of the duchy of azerbaijan, which had been raised by the spanish in the 17th century to protect french trade. louis xivs son by adalhard vi de havannes was killed during the battle, but his son, adalhard ii de havannes, was able to succeed him in the following year. adalhard vii then took control of the duchy of azerbaijan, which was split between the duchy of kosovo and the duchy of serbia. in 1742, he established the kingdom of saudi arabia, which was the first non-spanish kingdom in the middle east. saudi arabia became the dominant power in the area around the middle of the 17th century. the power of the british east india company in the region continued to decline; in the 18th century it had controlled the vast majority of the oil fields in the region and had played a significant role in the development of the british empire. in the 18th century, the dominance of the dutch east india company was eclipsed by the growing power of the british east india company throughout the region. the last dutch ruler, adalhard ii of saudi arabia, in the 18th century, saudi arabia lost control of much of the sea coast to the british empire. the kingdom of sardinia and the peninsula of florence largely disappeared and was absorbed into the british empire. western saudi arabia was absorbed into the british empire in 1874. the kingdom of cairo, founded in 1874, and the kingdom of duhaf were absorbed into the british empire. the kingdom of sardinia, established in 1878, was absorbed into the british empire under the administration of haakon in 1883. the kingdom of daba in 1885, was absorbed into the british empire. the kingdom of saudi arabia and the kingdom of cairo became the royal almighty kingdom of saudi arabia in 1889.the kingdom of saudi arabia arose from the merger of the royal family of saudi arabia with the royal family of sardinia, in 1874. the saudi king succeeded in 1874 after the death of his father, who had succeeded in saudi arabia. the royal marriage took place in 1875, at the hajj al-husayf in mecca. the saudi family was founded by the son of the saudi ambassador to china  the saudi dynasty was established in 1874 by the son of the last saudi king, adalhard ii.the last king of saudi arabia was saudi arabias youngest general, muhammad ibn saud, who succeeded his father in 1876. he spent most of his time at the hajj al-husayf in saudi arabia, attending to matters of state there. the saudi king was a staunch saudi defender of the shia orthodoxy, until the 18th century. he spent most of his time at the hajj al-husayf defending the city of mecca from attack from the salafs. he was known for his keen sense of military strategy and his ability to improvise battlefield tactics. he was, in short, a military genius.in 1878, the saudi arabian congress decreed that saudi arabia would exclusively be a kingdom of saudi arabia, the last of the former saudi possessions in the middle east, and that saudi arabia would be ruled by a king. the change was gradual, and only became officially accepted after the death of the saudi king in 1834.the death of the saudi king in 1834 was short-lived, and the kingdom dissolved into a series of administrative divisions. the new kingdom of saudi arabia however was established just a few years later under the abbasids. it served as a middle power between the two royal houses. the abbasids were the last dynasty to uphold the traditional values of the arabian peninsula and to utilize the saudi oil fields. the saudi kingdom was the dominant power in the region for the next 100 years, until the abbasids overthrew the abbasids and established the ta0th century, saudi leaders invested in the growing agrarian economy. saudi arabias population today consists of about 1.5% of the world population.",0,1
"mealworms are shed during the larval phase of the worms life cycle; shed eggs form ""worms"" around the worms core. larvae move up the appendage of the worm and into the crawlers path. inhaling the worms excreta travels with the worms and passes into the ciliate warts of the nectar-bearing flowers. the worms use these warts as a chemical feed.wormwood is a porous, fibrous material used by larvae of the gourametera aquatica to puncture the sticky resin used as a base for their shells and then to build their shells. warts may be found on the surface of the fruit or nectar, in the air, or in the drinking water.wormwood is a highly viscous substance, and the more damaged the worms get, the more viscous wormwood they will produce. in addition, warts can be found in areas where the fruit is ripe, so the worms have a ""holding post"" to secure the food in their stony structures.wormwood is classified by various suppliers as either ""smooth"" or ""chunky"". the smooth warts tend to be uniform in size, while the chunky warts tend to be more streaked than uniform in size. the uniformity of the warts makes them useful as a pest control, as they prevent the warts from sticking to each other. however, some growers prefer to keep the warts out of the plants, using a method that involves soaking the warts in water. this allows the plants to retain some of the water that evaporates during evaporation and prevents the worms from sticking. warts that have been soaked in water can be dried later, ready to use again. the method used to dry the worms is as follows: first remove the worms from the plant by tonguing them into the side of the container, then carefully place the container upside down and keep the lid on the container for fifteen to twenty minutes. the worms should be able to be picked off with a sticky lure, if they are not ejected by the water. if they are stuck, they are ready to be cooked. the longer the worms are stored, the longer they will last. the worms will begin to brown and become black. the black color is caused by the gradual dehydration of the worms. the worms can be eaten raw or cooked, though the cooking causes some problems: the meat may slip from the meat in the liquid stage, and the liquid may become sticky. in the first stage, the worms remain so dehydrated that they do not break down easily. as the worms continue to cook, the color of the meat changes from black to dark golden brown. the worms become very hard, about 3 to 5 minutes. at the end of the cooking process, the meat is cooked through but is still pliable. this is the stage in which the worms become attached to the metal or other materials in the container, and so they may be moved around the containers edges. once attached, the worms remain inert for about five minutes before they become pests. the number of worms harvested per kg of plant is similar in both crops.wormwood is a more expensive product and is usually associated with the use of a high-pressure, bucket-type infestation for controlling bollworms. the use of wormwood in this manner is not recommended as it may harm the plants or the workers who may come in contact with the wood. the wormwood product is more attractive to bollworms as the worms do not damage the plants directly, but they can be carried away by the wind and dispersed by the wind. however, if infested with bollworms, wormwood may be injurious to the bollworm.in the southern united states, the bollworm is controlled by spraying the plants with insecticides. these insecticides are not effective in controlling the main pest, the soil bollworm. the bollworm also attacks plants that are part of the shade-controlling insects, such as tomato plants. shade-controlling insects include the mealybug, brown spider mite, and brown limb moth. shade-controlling insects are typically parasitized by the brown spider mite. the magnitude of this pest depends on the species that are parasitised by the brown spider mite.by altering the relative humidity in the air, some climate change may be responsible for an increase in the number of brown spider mites.reduced salinity of tomatoes, decreased salinity of cucumbers, and the potential reduction in nitrogen and phosphorus in the soil through a reduction of ammonium fertiliser use could contribute to the browning of some fruits.some products sold in stores may contain bisphenol. this chemical is a mixture of two organic molecules, both of which are considered to cause the skin irritation and rash it causes. it may also cause the eyes irritation and reddening of redness and staining of the skin. the ingredient in some products is not regulated by the food and drug administration  in some cases,",0,1

by 2015, syrian president muammar gaddafi was dead, and his regime had been defeated. but the term ""terrible"" is often used to refer to the immediate post-coup aftermath, when any semblance of normalcy is immediately reasserted, and after a brief period of relative calm, the following set of events usually leads to further violence:a series of natural disasters in 2015 threatened both the government and the population in syria. the country was badly affected by the unrest, which resulted in over 140,000 deaths and 4.7 million homeless people. in august 2015, a series of natural disasters struck syria. in may, the government declared a state of emergency in syria; in july, the government of the united states, the european union, the central bank of the united states, and the central bank of the united kingdom announced a sovereign debt restructuring; and in september, the united states, central europe union, and the european union agreed to work towards a new framework for the debt settlement process. the terms of the new framework were announced in october 2015.in december 2015, the government of the united states, the central bank of the united states, and the european union ended their bond-buying of arab bonds. bond-buying resumed in february 2016, but this was the first time in six years that the syrian government did not issue bonds.in 2016, the government of the united states, the central bank of the united states, and the european union completed the second round of quantitative easing  the policy of QE was initially conceived in the economic stimulus act of 2007 and implemented in september 2008, in the context of the countries economic performance. in early january 2009, the treasury announced that quantitative easing would begin immediately, and that the treasury would purchase as much treasury debt as it could sell. the first bond-buying spree in 2016 was followed by a prolonged period of reduced bond-buying in march and early april. bond-buying resumed in april 2016, during the covid-19 pandemic in syria and eastern asia, causing a large loss in foreign exchange, which caused further economic hardship among syrians.by the end of march 2020, bond-buying had been reduced to its lowest level in almost 13 years; bond issuance was partially suspended. bond-market volatility in the middle of april and the first part of may was the most significant factor in the stock market decline. the government of syria, in power since 2013, continued to buy up syrian debt, buying $478 billion in the first half of 2019, the country had $1.8 billion of cash on hand. syrian government bonds held the equivalent of approximately $1.8 billion in cash on deposit at central banks as of june019., the team is a group of mostly professional gamers who compete as members of a particular game type, usually called ""team league"", ""tournament""  the teams consist of a player from each team participating in that player/team leagues. the game type can be one of four types, or can be a combination of two or more types. the four type team system can be found in the table below. team type Team total salary per player salary cap hit per year salary cap hit per year per player salary cap hit per year per playersalary cap hit per year per teamml germany is the most prominent german league, and is followed by austria, denmark, sweden, finland, germany, italy, spain, poland, austria, denmark, turkey, netherlands, finland, germany, and belgium. sweden, denmark, and finland have the largest pool of players. there are also european union, a northern hemisphere division of the united nations, and iceland, a southern hemisphere confederation. each of the four major european sports has a national team.the european clubs have a set of rules that determine the uniform players that may wear either a red, white, blue, or royal blue jersey. the uniform also varies according to the host of the games, which vary in 2004, 2007, and 2012. the jersey also varies by gender. the national team of germany, for example, usually wears a long light blue jersey with a red field around its neck, with the teams alternate shirts usually consisting of a light blue and light gold. the jersey also varies by country.the national football team of germany plays ""ball""  the ball, originally called a ""ballonie"", is a ball, firstly shaped to fit into the large handgrip of the player wearing it, and then held in the players hand to be played. the ball may also be shaped to improve its bounce. the ball may also be shaped to prevent it from being bounced.the rules for ball games",0,1
"1928: the first automobile and motorcycle taxis were delivered to customers at kensington station.in the same year, the carnegie mellon university daniel john carnegie institute for research in motor vehicles  in the 1950s, the institute funded a research project to test the kensington and boulevard electric trains, and later the siskind electric streetcar project. in the 1960s, the institute supported the mid-atlantic regional rail service with $150015. the first passenger electric car was introduced in the u.s. in 1964 with the sales success of the v-max and the v-r. the first passenger electric car was produced in the united states by harley-davidson in 1965. the first car sold without a manual transmission was the gremlin, and the first that came with a power steering system was the columbia grande. electric cars that were fitted with a power steering system were sold to the general public by harley-davidson.in 1974, harley-davidson announced the plans to build a transport car without a power steering, named the siemens alphard. the first siemens alphard cars were delivered to customers in 1981.in the 1980s, prius was the first car sold without a power steering. the first vehicle with a power steering was the bebop, sold in the united states by borman car, later renamed bebop. the car sold 5 million in its first year.in 1999, harley-davidson announced that all of its passenger cars would be powered by battery power. in 2001, the first electric car was the bebop electric, sold in the united states by borman car. in 2002, the first mass-produced electric car was the bebop columbia grande, sold in the united states by borman car. in 2004, harley-davidson introduced the bebop international, sold in the u.s. by borman car.in 2005, electric vehicles were the second-largest category in the world, and the market share of electric cars in the u.s. remained steady for the next two years. in 2006, the sales of electric cars increased by over 50%. in 2007, the global sales of electric cars were 4.2 million new cars driven in 2012014, with nearly two million of those being the 2006 model year-end sales.by 2007, the market for fuel-efficient cars had further increased due to the increasing number of people who were switching to healthier lifestyles and due to a number of companies which were developing or entering new vehicles in the market. most countries were selling a combination of gasoline and hybrid models; however, china, india, japan, and thailand were the countries with the most market share for fuel-efficient cars. the market share of diesel vehicles was lower due to concerns about fleets being over-stretched to meet the demand for more fuel-efficient cars. in 2013, the total market for fuel-efficient cars was 565 million vehicles. the market share for fuel-efficient cars has further decreased due to concerns about emissions. in june 2014, it was estimated that more than a million electric vehicles were sold in the u.s. the year prior. in july 2014, spain was the top country in the world for the number of new electric cars sold.in may 2013, daimler sales reached 30 million vehicles. in august 2013, the sales of e-cars reached 10 million. in september 2013, the sales of hydrogen-fueled cars reached 3.5 million. in october 2013, car sharing services reached 5 million countries. in october 2013, there were more than 300 car sharing services in the u.s. the first e-hustle year in 2010, the e-car industry reached a milestone in the u.s. with the introduction of the daimler electric car. in 2011, the number of suds sold in the u.s. was 1.8 million. in june 2012, the first time a daimler e-class vehicle sold under an american brand name was the daimler electric car. in july 2012, the first daimler-branded drive-in grocery store was opened in albuquerque, new mexico. in october 2013, daimler launched the daimler drive-in grocery store.daimler is a subsidiary of daimler group  the company is responsible for the design of and manufacture of pedal bike electric cars. daimler also owns and operates the company honda drive-in, the first honda-branded car store in north america and the first store to offer e-cars without a manual transmission. the store is located in manhattan, new york city and serves all of north america and features a variety of honda-branded models, including the original model honda clio, as well as the models",0,1
