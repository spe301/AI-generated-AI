# AI-generated-AI
Using Potosnail [refrence at: https://github.com/spe301/Potosnail ] to collect model hyperparameters, training data attributes, and model training results to train a model to predict the best Neural Network hyperparameter combination and architecture for the task at hand.

# Datasets used

## Feed-Forward Network training data 
* Breast Cancer (classification)
* Boston Housing prices (regression)

## CNN training data
* Dogs and Cats 

## RNN training data
* 9,000 tweets
* Fake Or Real https://www.kaggle.com/spencerholley/fake-or-real

# Future works
As of now I have plans to train the models on a wider range of datasets, and also include GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks). I'm also considering migrating to Pytorch from Tensorflow/Keras, I think this would be a good way to learn Pytorch but I won't do it until I feel like learning Pytorch would be benefical.
