# AI-generated-AI
Using Potosnail [refrence at: https://github.com/spe301/Potosnail ] to collect model hyperparameters, training data attributes, and model training results to train a model to predict the best Neural Network hyperparameter combination and architecture for the task at hand.

# Datasets used

## Feed-Forward Network training data 
* Breast Cancer (classification)
* Boston Housing prices (regression)

## CNN training data
* Dogs and Cats 

## RNN training data
* 9,000 tweets
* Wikipedia articles + AI generated articles

# Future works
As of now I have plans to train the models on a wider range of datasets, and also include GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks). I'm also considering setting up GPU locally rather than using colabs and migrating to Pytorch Tensorflow/Keras, the former seams more practical at the moment.
